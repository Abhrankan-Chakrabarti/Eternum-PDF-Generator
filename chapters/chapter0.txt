Annie: Hi! I'm Annie! It's really nice to meet you! Thank you for downloading the game! I wanted to kick things off by welcoming you and giving you a couple of tips to ensure you’re all set for the   journey ahead. This game is pretty straightforward, and you seem like a pretty smart person, so I   don’t think you’ll have much difficulty at all! Here’s a few things that might help you along the   way... This little icon will beat if you do something the girl in front of you liked! Like this!    When you click on it, you'll see your current stats and standings with all the girls you’ve met     during your adventure. You can even use your mouse wheel or the arrows on your keyboard to see all  the different looks for each one of them! But be careful! If you happen to see a girl that's greyed out, it means you’ve screwed up somewhere. In order to get on her path again, you’ll have to        backtrack and find out where things went wrong! Remember, good things are worth fighting for! And,  well, I’m sure you know the rest. I don’t think it’s your first time playing this type of game...   The dialogue appears here, but remember, you can hide all UI at any time by pressing the "H" key. If you see text that appears in parentheses, it means you’re reading that character’s thoughts!       (Testing... testing. Yep! Things appear to be working just fine! Oh, and since all my thoughts are  already on display here, let me tell you that you should keep the music and sound effects enabled!  You can even adjust the music volume from the Preferences menu, as well as the size and opacity of  the textbox! Sounds and music make the game soooo much better, trust me. It’s way more... immersive! You won't regret it!) And that's it! Thanks for hearing me out! I wish you a very–                 Dalia: What the hell is going on here? What are you doing, Annie? Are you welcoming the new players? I thought I was in charge of doing that!                                                           Annie: Dalia! I... Um... I know this was supposed to be your job, but there's been a change of      plans.                                                                                              Dalia: What? Why? Who decided that?!                                                                Annie: You know... him!                                                                             Dalia: What? He didn't say anything to me about a change of plans... You–                           Annie: Yeah, well, um... Anyway, there's no use cryin' over spilled milk! Besides, I’m sure the new player is eager to begin! We should get going!                                                      Dalia: Hmmm...                                                                                      Annie: Bye-bye for now! I hope to see you soon! Enjoy!
