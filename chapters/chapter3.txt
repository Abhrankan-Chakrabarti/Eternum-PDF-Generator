Orion: AAaaargh...!                                                                                 Nova: Orion?!                                                                                       Orion: My head...                                                                                   Alex: Are you ok?                                                                                   Orion: Y-Yeah... Sorry, I don't know what happened... I have a splitting headache all of a sudden... Maybe I’m still not used to Eternum...?                                                            Nova: Oh shit...                                                                                    Orion: D-Don't worry, I'm already feeling better...                                                 Alex: We should really get out of here. The Praetorians could’ve sent out a distress signal as soon as things got crazy...                                                                              Calypso: ...Who are you?                                                                            Nova: F-Fuck! S-She can talk!                                                                       Calypso: Should I not be able to...?                                                                Nova: N-No! I mean... Yes? I d-don't know! Who are you?!                                            Calypso: My name is Calypso.                                                                        Nova: C-Calypso?                                                                                    Calypso: Daughter of Raewyn and Princess of the Sy-tel-quessir.                                     Nova: Princess?                                                                                     Calypso: Now tell me who you are.                                                                   Nova: I'm... Nova... Uhh... daughter of Sandra.                                                     Orion: My name is Orion.                                                                            Alex: ...Alexandra. I can't believe you're an NPC... I would have never guessed. You seem so...     lifelike. Are you really the third Weapon of Atlas?                                                 Calypso: Atlas? Who is that? I do not recall meeting anyone with that name. But if I am being       honest, I... I can barely even remember how I got here. How did you find me?                        Alex: Well, I discovered you were hidden within this server. This place normally isn’t publicly     accessible, but Nova found a way in. We ended up fighting against two Praetorians and a few         soldiers, and then you came out of that box over there.                                             Calypso: Servers...? Praetorians...?                                                                Orion: Oh god, this is gonna be harder than I thought. Maybe that's why this place is off-limits... her programming isn’t finished yet.                                                                 Nova: Why don't you tell us your story? What do you remember?                                       Calypso: I am the Princess of the Hyril'ar Realm. I was born with a gift. And I am the one destined to free my people.                                                                                  Nova: Free your people...? From who?                                                                Calypso: The Immortals. They confined me to that prison because they fear my power. I have been     trapped here for... longer than I can remember... I must return to my realm.                        Orion: Is your... "realm" in this forest?                                                           Calypso: It is not. My realm does not resemble anything of this place – it is of another...         dimension. Within our reality lie thousands of parallel worlds, where each one has its own cultures, civilizations, and even climates... Not even the typical laws of physics and nature apply there. It is... difficult to explain. You would not understand.                                              Alex: *Whispering* Ohh... I see what's going on... *Whispering* She's talking about Eternum! She    must be from the lore about The Princess of the Elves...                                            Nova: Yeah... We know what you're talking about. These... "parallel worlds", as you said... We call them servers.                                                                                       Calypso: What? So, you too were gifted at birth? You possess the ability to travel between worlds at will?                                                                                              Nova: Well... almost. We just need to find an Exit Portal first. Then log out, and connect again.   Alex: So is that your gift? Jumping between worlds whenever you want?                               Calypso: It... was my gift... But now that I am bound with this shackle of dimeritium around my     neck, the Immortals have managed to suppress my magical abilities.                                  Alex: Well, we can help. We can remove that shackle from you.                                       Calypso: I am afraid it is not that easy. Swords... maces... saws... none of them can make a single dent. These chains can only be destroyed with magic. So, until I am free of such shackles, I am     afraid my gift is all but lost...                                                                   Alex: Well, lucky for you, I happen to be pretty skilled with my magical abilities.                 Calypso: Really? W-Wait... Yes... You must be!  That is elven mail you are wearing, right?          Alex: Yeah, it is!                                                                                  Calypso: Ashen hair, elven robes, wielder of magic... You are a Peredhil!                           Alex: A... What?                                                                                    Calypso: Gifted with Elven magic, but damned to the mortal life of Men... you are a half-elf.       Offspring of an elf and a human, and the product of the most forbidden of loves... I always found   the thought of it to be quite... intoxicating. The more forbidden it is, the more thrilling it      becomes... would you not agree?                                                                     Alex: Um... Maybe, yeah, but I'm not half-elf. I’m just human.                                      Calypso: Are you sure about that? You could almost pass for one of us, except for the ears. Did you ever meet your parents?                                                                             Alex: Unfortunately, yes. And I'm pretty sure they're both human.                                   Calypso: Oh, really? Well that is quite interesting...                                              Alex: Enough about me though. How about we get that chain off of you? Are you ready?                Calypso: I am.                                                                                      Alex: Okay, hold the chain just like this and don't move a muscle. It might burn a little, but don’t worry. On the count of three. One, two... Alright... You’re doing great... Now just a little bit   more... Don't move...                                                                               Calypso: Mm-hm... Hmm...? Oh my! Holy Mother of Turska! You did it! I am free!                      Alex: You're welcome!                                                                               Calypso: I... I feel whole again! My magic... it is back!                                           Orion: Alright guys, I think we should get moving now. I don't want more Praetorians to... To...    *Trying to move your legs* What... What's going on? Why... Why can't I move my body?! I’M           PARALYZED!!                                                                                         Nova: What the... I – I am too!! I can't move!                                                      Calypso: Did you really think I was going to blindly trust you like a fool?                         Nova: W-What? You're causing this?!                                                                 Calypso: Do not fret, my scarlet little one... You have nothing to fear... As long as you have      nothing to hide...                                                                                  Nova: W-We’re good people! We just wanted to help you!                                              Calypso: I have been trapped inside that box for ages, and I have no intention of ever going back.  As soon as I can ensure you are not working alongside the Immortals, you will be released. I cannot afford to have any loose ends. I do hope you understand my predicament.                             Nova: We're not working for anyone! I swear!                                                        Calypso: I am afraid your promises are of no use here. I must see it for myself...                  Alex: Goddammit, let us go! After what I did for you, how could you do this?!                       Calypso: I sense your nervousness, Alexandra. Is there something you do not wish for me to uncover? It is of no matter. I shall just take a deep glimpse into your mind... your thoughts will have no   place to hide there.                                                                                Alex: For fuck's sake, what the hell is going on?! You're a Weapon of Atlas! You're supposed to obey us!                                                                                                Calypso: I am Calypso, Princess of the Sy-tel-quessir. I obey no one.                               Alex: H-How... how are you doing that? You’re speaking without moving your lips...!                 Calypso: It is not from my mouth that you hear me, Alexandra. I am within your mind now.            Alex: W-What?                                                                                       Calypso: Looks like your life has had many twists and turns over the last few days... your thoughts are scattered, emotions in disarray...                                                              Alex: S-Shut the fuck up!                                                                           Nova: A-Alex? Are you ok...?                                                                        Calypso: Only you can hear me, Alexandra.                                                           Alex: I... I d-don't know! I don’t know what’s happening!                                           Calypso: Hmm... Ah, I see you have now begun guarding yourself. Your efforts are futile, however. I will just have to exert myself a little further...                                                  Orion: What is she doing?                                                                           Alex: I have no idea! But I don't like it!                                                          Calypso: . . . Hmm. You are not Immortals.                                                          Alex: That’s what we’ve been telling you this whole time!                                           Nova: Why the hell would we free you if we’re working for the people who imprisoned you in the first place?!                                                                                            Calypso: Hmm...                                                                                     Alex: *Falling to the floor* Ooof!                                                                  Nova: My legs are all tingly!!                                                                      Calypso: Egleri i anor. I believe I do owe you all an apology... I made the mistake of being too    trusting in the past... and as you can see, I will not let that happen again.                       Orion: Wow, you can change the weather?!                                                            Calypso: I can do many things. I may only be of 84 summers, but my magical abilities have already   surpassed those of the Elderly Council... by far.                                                   Orion: Um... I'm sorry, did you just say you're only 84?                                            Calypso: I know you humans always have a hard time trying to comprehend true longevity. I am of the race that lives for thousands of years. We understand time... differently. For us, time is not      necessarily just a looming countdown toward a bitter demise. We have learned to see it as something physical... an asset that we can master and control. So... for us, an elf of 40 or 50 years is      little more than a child.                                                                           Orion: Wow, it's... hard to imagine such a way of living. And what were you doing to Alexandra? Were you reading her mind?                                                                              Calypso: Indeed. I cannot see the actions of one’s past, but I can witness their thoughts and       emotions. It is enough to determine intentions and motives. Your friend is very... intriguing.      Alex: W-What’s that supposed to mean?!                                                              Calypso: *Chuckles* Nothing... After all, we are speaking here now, so it means I liked what I      saw...                                                                                              Alex: You better not say anything! *Mumbling* Ulysses went too far with this one...                 Nova: So... you can read people's thoughts just by touching their heads?                            Calypso: That is correct. Would you like me to try it on you?                                       Nova: Hell no! That sounds terrible! I mean... not that I have anything to be ashamed of... there’s no weird or scandalous thoughts, a-alright?! I umm... just want to keep my thoughts to myself!      Orion: Um... I'm not sure you’re quite the saint when it comes to respecting one’s privacy... eh    Nova?                                                                                               Nova: W-What?! What's that supposed to mean?                                                        Orion: Well... You know... with the hacking... and...                                               Nova: Whaaat?! That's totally different!                                                            Orion: No, it's not! Tell me how it's different!                                                    Nova: Well, one, I can't read minds. I merely uncover personal information that people so foolishly leave unsecure, on their phones, tablets, computers, and...                                         Orion: Hmm, that personal information sounds awfully like stuff they’d prefer to keep private...    Nova: Well, yeah, I guess, but... Erm... OH MY GOD, YOU’RE RIGHT! IT IS THE SAME! I AM A PRIVACY    VIOLATOR!                                                                                           Orion: THANK YOU! At last, you admit it!                                                            Nova: It’s not my fault you set your password to boobs69!                                           Orion: H-Hey! I created that password when I was only–                                              Nova: Agh, you’re right, Orion. I am a terrible person! Well why haven’t you mentioned this to me   before?!!                                                                                           Orion: I’ve told you a hundred times!                                                               Nova: B-But... how am I supposed to know what shows you’re watching, then? Or what you enjoy eating? Or what your favorite movie is?!                                                                   Orion: Uh... by asking me?                                                                          Nova: HOW– Huh... Oh... I... guess you’re right. That doesn’t sound too terrible.                   Orion: You’ve gotten so used to hacking everyone that you got stuck in your own world. You forgot   there’s a world... and other people... that are willing to freely share with you.                   Nova: I'm sorry, Orion... It's just that... I'm not used to interacting with people much. I’ve never really had any true friends... and I guess I never learned how to be one, either... I'm sorry. I   won't do it again.                                                                                  Be tough with her                                                                                   Orion: You had better not.                                                                          Nova: I won't...                                                                                    Forgive her                                                                                         Orion: Don't worry, Nova. I know you never did any of those things with bad intentions. And hey,    don't take it to heart. As the world’s greatest hacker, you can still put your skills to good use!  We can’t afford to lose you!                                                                        Nova: *Giggles* Don't worry, you won't! I'll hack whatever you need, Orion. You just have to ask!   From now on, I’ll be your personal hacker!                                                          Orion: *Laughs* That sounds nice.                                                                   Calypso: ...Hacking? Is that a type of magic within your world?                                     Orion: Um, yeah... in a sense. But it’s a little bit different. It would probably take too long to  explain.                                                                                            Calypso: Is it related to the worlds of machines?                                                   Orion: Worlds of machines?                                                                          Calypso: You mentioned you can travel through other worlds too. There are some in which people rely on artifacts made of metal and light... Are you from there?                                         Orion: Yeah! Have you been in futuristic servers too?                                               Calypso: ...I guess. I have traversed hundreds of worlds, each more astonishing than the last. I    spent all my life trying to control my gift... to perfect it. I was so close to finally harnessing  that power... but then the Immortals came. I do not know how long I have been trapped within that   cage, but now it just feels like... I have awoken from a long dream.                                Orion: That sounds pretty miserable.                                                                Calypso: I... I have yet to thank you for releasing me. I owe you a deep debt of gratitude, I will  not forget that. Looks like these clouds are reluctant to leave.                                    Orion: I didn't even know it was possible to change the weather of a... world.                      Alex: Speaking of owing us... can you help us get out of here? We can't leave this place without an artifact called an "Exit Portal". If we try to go back to our real world without it, we might lose  everything we have. And it could potentially cause us physical harm.                                Calypso: Hmm... Yes, I can try. I will attempt to open an exit for you. Step back and close your    eyes. It has been quite a while since I last tried this, so... I hope I remember. *Breathes slowly* Glem ni sa' eradin.                                                                                 Nova: Wow! That looks so cool!                                                                      Alex: Amazing...                                                                                    Calypso: I w-would appreciate it if you would quickly utilize it... Keeping this portal open is     quite draining... Especially with my recent lack of practice.                                       Nova: Of course! Sorry! Whoa... It looks so beautiful from up close...                              Alex: And where does it lead?                                                                       Calypso: I... do not know.                                                                          Alex: What do you mean you don't know?                                                              Calypso: I was once able to create portals to the worlds that were more familiar to me, but now...  It could lead anywhere.                                                                             Nova: So... a random server? How exciting!!                                                         Alex: Well, uhh... who's going first?                                                               Nova: Um... Calypso?                                                                                Calypso: I must be the last, in order to keep the portal open.                                      Nova: Okay then... Alex?                                                                            Alex: Why me?! What if it's a server where...                                                       Orion: W-Wh– *Coughing* W-What...                                                                   Nova: W-W-What’s going on? Is t-that... Is that T-Thanatos? The top player of Eternum? D-did he just g-grab a Gem of Doom from Orion's pocket? Am I going crazy?                                        Alex: What the... W-Where did he go?! What the fuck is going on!! How... . . .                      Nova: W-What... A-Alex?!                                                                            Calypso: *Choking* Ghh...                                                                           Thanatos: Open the portal.                                                                          Calypso: N-N-No...                                                                                  Thanatos: Open. The. Portal.                                                                        Calypso: *Choking* I c-cannot... b-breathe...                                                       Thanatos: *Squeezing her neck* I won't ask again.                                                   Calypso: Gghh...                                                                                    Thanatos: . . .                                                                                     Nova: *Panting* It's impossible... The shot went right through his neck... The rumors are true... He c-can't be killed...                                                                               Alex: *Panting* You... You gotta get out of here... He's gonna take Dione...                        Nova: I'm not going anywhere! I'm not a coward!                                                     Alex: Don’t be a fool...                                                                            Nova: F-Fuck... Promise me we're gonna level up again together...                                   Thanatos: *Lifting his sword*                                                                       Nova: *Trembling* H-Huh...?                                                                         Thanatos: Grrr... *Grunting*                                                                        Nova: . . .                                                                                         Alex: What the hell is going on... ...Orion?                                                        Thanatos: *Grunting* H-Heh... I must say, you’ve done more damage here than most. You're fast. I'll give you that, boy. *Grunts* A-And... you're... strong... But not strong enough. *Throwing you to   the ground*                                                                                         Orion: AGHH!                                                                                        Thanatos: Do you know why Eternum is better than the other world, boy? Here, the law of the         strongest is always imposed. The strong... prevail. The weak... die. And you...? You are powerless. Inferior. Defective. Weak. And so you too... Shall die. . . . . . .                                 Calypso: I will not be bound again.                                                                 Thanatos: No one can escape from me.                                                                Calypso: And that is where you are wrong. You have failed. I will not be confined by you, or anyone else that crosses my path.                                                                          Thanatos: You're just delaying the inevitable. The fate of Eternum is already written.              Calypso: Then I shall rewrite it.                                                                   Thanatos: You don't even know why you were created.                                                 Calypso: . . . I do know one thing. I am strong. And the strong, prevail. The weak... die.          Thanatos: . . . . . . . .                                                                           Calypso: E'goven aman' ech... Eneth lin i'ravar... E'goven aman' ech...                             Orion: Hmm... What... Where... where am I?                                                          Calypso: Orion? Can you hear me?                                                                    Orion: Am I... dead?                                                                                Calypso: Not today. I was able to heal your wounds. You should start feeling better soon.           Orion: My w-wounds? Oh yeah. Hm, you’re right... I am starting to feel a bit better already. T-Thank you, Calypso.                                                                                      Calypso: That spear pierced you from the back and drove right through your heart... I am surprised  you did not die immediately!                                                                        Orion: Heh, I guess I’ve got some beginner’s luck on my side. *Standing up* I feel... fine. I’d say I’m right back to normal! Thank you, Calypso. I would’ve had to start from square one if it wasn’t  for you.                                                                                            Calypso: It was the least I could do.                                                               Nova: Orion!!                                                                                       Alex: You're still alive!                                                                           Orion: Nova, Alex! I'm glad to see you two are alright, after how badly you were injured. You both  had so much more to lose than me!                                                                   Nova: Calypso healed us too!                                                                        Alex: Now seriously Orion – tell us how you managed to do it!                                       Nova: You were incredible!                                                                          Alex: Where did you learn that magic?!                                                              Orion: What?                                                                                        Alex: Don't play dumb with us! You somehow managed to stand up to Thanatos!                         Nova: THE THANATOS!                                                                                 Orion: Did I? It’s all kind of a blur to me now...                                                  Alex: Are you kidding?! He was just about to kill us, but then, like a bolt of lightning, you       appeared out of nowhere and severed his hand in a single blow!                                      Nova: *Nodding* Mhm! Mhm!                                                                           Alex: Then his hand and sword fell to the ground... and blood started pouring out from his leftover stump! It looked like a fountain!                                                                   Nova: *Nodding* Mhm! Mhm!                                                                           Alex: He didn't scream, but grabbed his wrist like this in an attempt to stop the bleeding. He was  all like... “Grrr...” Holy fucking shit! It was so badass!                                          Nova: *Nodding* Mhm! Mhm! And then when we looked over, we saw you off to the side... bloody and    shirtless... with Thanatos’ spear still in your chest!                                              Alex: *Nodding* Mhm! Mhm!                                                                           Nova: You turned around and had a strange blackness in your eyes, like this! It was even on your    arms and hands too! You almost looked like you were possessed. It was super scary!                  Alex: *Nodding* Mhm! Mhm!                                                                           Nova: Next, Thanatos said something, and you looked at him with your demon eyes like, "Roarrrrr!!   I'm gonna kill you!" Then you moved so fast to attack him and managed to break his armor! Blood     everywhere!!                                                                                        Alex: *Nodding* Mhm! Mhm!                                                                           Nova: But after, he knocked you down and it looked like he was gonna rip your head off with one of  his spears.                                                                                         Alex: Yeah, I'm not gonna lie, things didn’t look very good for you at that point.                  Nova: We'd all be dead, if it wasn't for Calypso's portals.                                         Orion: Damn... Thanks again, Calypso.                                                               Calypso: No need to mention it. So, you cannot recall anything that happened?                       Orion: Well, I remember feeling a sharp pain in my heart after the spear hit me. And after that, I  just remember lying on the snow... seeing my blood form a growing pool around me. Fuck, I've never  felt so much pain in my life. It was... unbearable. I get they wanted to make this game as realistic as possible, but... Jesus... they really did go the extra mile with the sensations... I... Well,   when I say "game", I mean...                                                                        Calypso: It is okay. You are not the first person I have met who believes their realm is the only   real one.                                                                                           Orion: Well... It has to be, right? In order to even access Eternum from our world, we have to use  something called a “neural implant”.                                                                Calypso: Is that what qualifies your world as the “real” one? What about me... I need my portals to travel to other worlds also. How is it different? Tell me, is there something in that world of yours that you cannot do in the others?                                                                  Orion: Um...                                                                                        Calypso: Sorry, it is probably not the best time for such deep discussion after what you have       endured. What about the fight itself, do you remember anything about it?                            Orion: Yes, but like I said before... everything is still a bit blurry. I remember what I did, but  in the moment, it felt like I was moving by instinct. It’s almost as if I wasn’t even in control.   Calypso: It looked like ancient magic... You should try to train this power.                        Orion: Could you help me with that?                                                                 Calypso: Hmm... Perhaps...                                                                          Orion: Well, in any case, we should really get back to our world now. Where are we even at?         Calypso: Erm... I am not sure.                                                                      Orion: ...You don't know?                                                                           Calypso: I can only create portals to locations that are very familiar to me. But when I summon a   common portal... it can take us anywhere.                                                           Nova: And why didn't we go to one of the places you're already familiar with?                       Calypso: Well, I tried to, but... I could not. As I mentioned earlier, it is most likely because I  was unable to utilize my magic for so long. I might need some time to regain my full potential.     Orion: No worries, it's already impressive that you could get us out of there at the perfect time.  Calypso: Just... give me a bit of time to recover. I can do much more than summon portals, trust me.Orion: *Chuckles* I don't doubt it. Alright, so... to get out of here... Should we start heading in a certain direction, or...?                                                                         Calypso: It is probably not a good idea. These bioluminescent mushrooms are few and far between...  you could starve before even reaching the next one.                                                 Nova: Yeah, I can't see lights in any direction, aside from this one. Not even with my left eye.    Alex: I've heard of servers within the depths of Eternum that have procedurally generated maps...   where the bounds are technically infinite. They’re usually either unfinished or test servers. So    let’s listen to Calypso. It’s not the best idea to start walking in a place that looks like this.   Orion: What's the plan, then?                                                                       Calypso: Our only way out is to open another gateway. Just... give me a minute. It is very taxing to open so many portals in a row, especially if such portals are used by more than one person.        Orion: Sure, take the time you need.                                                                Calypso: My old teacher used to always tell me, “If at first, things do not go your way, you can    always go back and try again...” “Keep on trying until you reach your goal, Calypso...” “As many    times as it takes...” *Breathing slowly* Glem ni sa' eradin.                                        Nova: *Giggles* Am I the only one who's excited?! We get to travel to a random server! Again! It's  so cool! Could you imagine if we appear in one of those VIP servers, where only celebrities are     allowed?                                                                                            Alex: Or one of those servers that Ulysses restricted access to! Similar to Ogygia, but this time it could be one we don't even know exists...                                                          Nova: That'd be soooooo awesome!                                                                    Orion: Alright, time to get this over with. I’ll go first, just in case something bad awaits us on  the other side.                                                                                     Alex: That's the spirit!                                                                            Nova: We're right behind you!                                                                       Orion: *Sighs* On the count of three... One... two... three! *Coughs* Wow, that was fast. Um...     Hello? Girls? Calypso! Thank god. What sort of place is this?                                       Calypso: I have no idea. I have never seen a design like this before. And I cannot decipher that    language... Although it vaguely resembles the style of the elves of Myroyn.                         Orion: It definitely looks Asian to me. Probably Japanese.                                          Calypso: Japanese, huh... something from your world, I presume. I shall remember that.              Orion: Where are Nova and Alex?                                                                     Calypso: Oh... That is actually a good question. They must not have followed us. That is not good... would you mind scouting the area?                                                                  Orion: Sure. It'll probably give us an idea of where we might be too. Nova? Alex? (Shit, my voice   resounds through the halls like a deep cavern echo. This place gives me the creeps... I'm not sure  why.) There's no one out there. It looks like a private residence.                                  Calypso: Curses... We must have separated along the way.                                            Orion: W-What? What does that mean?                                                                 Calypso: If they are not within a short radius of us, it means they went to another... server, as   you call it.                                                                                        Orion: Fuck! And what do we do now?                                                                 Calypso: I will have to open two new portals simultaneously. One here, and another near wherever    they are.                                                                                           Orion: Oh, you can do that?! Amazing! Alright, let's go.                                            Calypso: *Breathing slowly*                                                                         Orion: Um... Calypso? Aren't we leaving?                                                            Calypso: I need to focus. As I mentioned before, summoning portals in quick succession is very...   exhausting. First, I must "find" Alexandra and Nova. If I take too long, however, I will lose track of them and we will be forced to leave them to their fate.                                          Orion: What if they found an exit portal on their own? They could be back in our real world already.Calypso: That is one possibility. If I cannot sense their auras within 15 minutes, we will have to  continue... with just the two of us.                                                                Orion: Damn, I'll let you concentrate then.                                                         Calypso: Thank you.                                                                                 Orion: I'll sit here and wait. Concentrate as much as you want. If I hear anything suspicious, or   see someone coming this way, I'll warn you.                                                         Calypso: I appreciate it, Orion.                                                                    Orion: (Maybe they did manage to get back to the real world, safe and sound. I hope nothing bad has happened to them... Losing Dione would really suck for Nova. Where on earth did they go...)         Nova: Arghhh... *Sitting up* Where am I... ...A castle?                                             Alex: Nova? *Sitting up* God, I feel so dizzy.                                                      Nova: Yeah, me too... It reminds me of the first few times I logged into Eternum.                   Alex: Yeah, exactly. Have you seen Orion? And Calypso?                                              Nova: No... I think it's just you and me.                                                           Alex: They have to be around here somewhere. Let's scope out this place...                          Nova: Yeah, let's go... . . .                                                                       Alex: . . .                                                                                         Nova: . . .                                                                                         Alex: . . .                                                                                         Nova: AAAAAAAARGHH!!!                                                                               Alex: AHHHHHHHHH!!!                                                                                 Nova: AAAAAAAARGHH!!!                                                                               Alex: AHHHHHHHHH!!!                                                                                 Nova: WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU A CARTOON?!                                                              Alex: M-Me? It's you who's a fucking cartoon! You look like you came straight out of a Pixar movie!!Nova: W-What?! AHHHH! OH SHIT! I'M A CARTOON! What is going on?!!                                   Alex: Ok, ok... l-let's calm down for a second and think... We were using Calypso's portal... and   were headed toward a random server... That’s it! We just happened to appear in a really strange     one!                                                                                                Nova: And... Where's C-Calypso? And Orion?                                                          Alex: They must be here somewhere. We have to find them and get the hell out of here.               Nova: B-But why do we look like Disney princesses? Am I hallucinating or something?                 Alex: No I don’t think you are... I think we really turned into cartoons.                           Nova: But how?! You can't change your appearance in Eternum!                                        Alex: Actually... that's not entirely true. You can't change your appearance, but Eternum can alter it for you, depending on which server you visit.                                                    Nova: Explain yourself...                                                                           Alex: Well, some servers have special conditions. I've not been there yet, but I heard you          automatically get gills and a functional mermaid tail when you're on the Atlantis server, for       instance.                                                                                           Nova: Ohh... I see, makes sense. Must be perfect for those seeking a particular fetish... So it’s   kinda like how you get turned into an animal species when you visit the Furry District in the Kink  Paradise server, right?                                                                             Alex: Yeah, as long as it affects all the players in the server equally, servers can do all sorts of things to your in-game character. I didn't know you used to visit the Kink Paradise server, though. Do you go there often?                                                                             Nova: Who, me? Nahhh! Too kinky for me! I just looked it up because I was curious... In case I had  to visit it some day. You know, for investigating stuff or something... I wanted to know what to    expect.                                                                                             Alex: That's a huge server. I heard it hosts the largest collection of pornography on Eternum.      Nova: Really?? I had no idea! You seem way more informed about it than me!                          Alex: Contrary to what most may think, sex-oriented servers like that one usually tend to be the    safest environments. They take numerous precautions and enforce many measures to make sure everyone is protected and taken care of. The servers that try to look “innocent” are usually the worst       offenders of hosting illegal activity.                                                              Nova: The most innocent?                                                                            Alex: Well, this server reminds me of one from a few years ago that was supposedly designed for     kids. Turns out, it was just a front for an enormous kiddie porn network. That discovery sparked all the controversy regarding the minimum age to play Eternum. The Ulysses lawyers were able to take   advantage of loopholes to ultimately win the legal battle that followed, however.                   Nova: W-What?! So we’ve found ourselves in some pedophile’s dungeon now?!                           Alex: No, no, I just mean this cartoon style reminds me of something meant to look innocent and     inconspicuous. In reality, it’s probably just a goofy little server.                                Nova: For pedophiles!! What if someone kidnaps us before we can find an exit portal?! They're gonna torture us!                                                                                         Alex: No one's gonna torture us, so stop screaming! I don't want to attract any unwanted attention! Nova: What do you mean by that?! Who's out there? Why are you trying to scare me?! We...            Snuggles the Happy Bear: *Growls*                                                                   Nova: AAAAAAAAAARGHH!!! A MONSTER!!!!!                                                              Snuggles the Happy Bear: Ahhhhh...                                                                  Alex: W-What the fuck, Nova?! Why did you shoot him?                                                Nova: I d-don't know! You had me on edge and he scared me! I thought he was going to eat me or drag me to his pedophile lair!                                                                           Alex: And how the hell do you have a gun here?                                                      Nova: B-Because it's D-Dione! It's a Weapon of Atlas! It can be used in any server, regardless of   the rules!                                                                                          Snuggles the Happy Bear: Aaaargh... Me chesty... so much hurty... It burny right where I lovey...   Alex: Oh my god, Nova, what have you done...                                                        Nova: It w-was an accident! I didn't mean to!                                                       Snuggles the Happy Bear: Ahhh... Me only wanted to welcomey... Snuggles... is in big owieeeee...    Princess Annabelle: Snuggles? What on earth was that noise? Snu– AAAAAAAHHH! OH MY GOD, SNUGGLES!   WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?!                                                                              Snuggles the Happy Bear: Princess? Me gotsa a big boo-boo...                                        Princess Annabelle: Snuggles! Don't worry, I'll go get the doctor! She'll heal you!                 Snuggles the Happy Bear: Me hurty so much... I no know if me can snuggle anymore... Please... telly me I was a good bear... I can't... breathe...                                                       Nova: *Crying* Oh my god, what have I done...                                                       Princess Annabelle: Who did this to you, Snuggles? Who are these people? Did they do this to you?!  Nova: It was an accident! He appeared out of nowhere and then I–                                    Princess Annabelle: How did you get into my castle?! You're gonna pay for this!                     Snuggles the Happy Bear: Princess? Me vision... fading... are you still there??                     Princess Annabelle: *Crying* I'm right here, Snuggles!                                              Snuggles the Happy Bear: I... Me only wanted to welcome... like good, happy bear...                 Princess Annabelle: *Crying* I know, Snuggles, I know...                                            Snuggles the Happy Bear: Now me only feel like sad... saddy bear...                                 Nova: *Crying* Oh my god... this is all my fault... *Crying* W-Wait! We have a friend who can heal  people! We’ll go and find her! *Crying* We can still heal Snuggles!                                 Princess Annabelle: It's too late for that, don't you see?!                                         Snuggles the Happy Bear: Me... Princessy...?                                                        Princess Annabelle: I'm here.                                                                       Snuggles the Happy Bear: Before me go... into fluffy cloud of warm snuggles...                      Princess Annabelle: *Crying* Yes, Snuggles...?                                                      Snuggles the Happy Bear: Can you makey me a promise?                                                Princess Annabelle: *Crying* Anything you want...                                                   Snuggles the Happy Bear: These... These two girls... Promise me... that... that...                  Snuggles the Sadistic Bear: They’re going to rot in a filthy prison cell like the dirty whores they are.                                                                                                Alex: W-Wait, what?                                                                                 Snuggles the Sadistic Bear: I want them to suffer and experience a purely horrendous demise.        Nova: But it was an accident!                                                                       Snuggles the Sadistic Bear: I want them to be ravaged by every single soldier of the castle.        Alex: WHAT THE F–                                                                                   Snuggles the Sadistic Bear: I want them to be thrown into the deepest pits, left only for the rats  to feast on their remains... To have their last memory be of nothing but misery and torment...      ...Like the complete opposite of a warm snuggle...                                                  Alex: You fucking son of a bitch! We should have shot this motherfucker in the head!                Snuggles the Happy Bear: That is all me wanty, me Princessy...                                      Princess Annabelle: Don't worry Snuggles, it will be done. THESE SKANKS WILL PAY WITH THEIR BLOOD!  Nova: IT WAS A FUCKING INNOCENT MISTAKE! AN ACCIDENT!!!!!!                                          Princess Annabelle: Shut the fuck up! GUARDS! TORTURE THESE BITCHES AND HAVE YOUR WAY WITH THEIR    WHORISH BODIES! THAT IS AN ORDER! You worthless wretches! Prepare to know why they call me ANNABELLE THE SKINNER! GET THEM!!                                                                            Orion: *Yawns* Hmm... (God, I wonder how long we've been playing during this session. We spent hours just walking through Ogygia's forest.) How is it going, Calypso? Any luck locating them?           Calypso: Yes... I can sense their presence. I am closing in on their location, so I shall open 2    portals simultaneously – one for them, and one for us. I hope they are able to get in quickly... We should prepare to leave as well. Get ready, it could be any moment now.                             Orion: Got it! (At least we're gonna leave this server without getting spotted. We're probably      trespassing on some rich fuck’s private residence.) *Standing up* (Oh my word...) Um... Hi!         C-Calypso? Are you ready to go? I think we might have a new problem on our hands...                 Fox Maiden: Good evening, Mr. Matsumoto.                                                            Orion: Erm... Yeah, that's me. Good evening!                                                        Fox Maiden: We hope you're enjoying your stay.                                                      Orion: Y-Yeah, it's been great. Very lovely... building... with nice... walls and stuff...          Fox Maiden: Mr. Hiromi is running a few minutes behind. He's terribly sorry about the delay.        Orion: Oh, no problem! I'll just wait here. Tell him there's no rush.                               Fox Maiden: To make your waiting more enjoyable, and as a token of his gratitude for the business   agreement between our two clans, he has brought you a gift.                                         Orion: Aw, he didn't have to! What's the gift?                                                      Fox Maiden: We are the gift.                                                                        Orion: Uh... You are the gift?                                                                      Fox Maiden: That is correct, sir. *Undressing* Our task is to satisfy all of your desires. We will  not leave until every lustful desire of yours is satisfied. Use us as your personal toys, as we     surrender ourselves to every inch of you... or lay back and let us take the lead... and do all of   the work.                                                                                           Orion: Oh my god...                                                                                 Fox Maiden: Whatever your wishes, we want nothing more than to fulfill them...                      Orion: Oh Jesus... W-What do you mean by... "whatever"?                                             Fox Maiden: *Giggles* Nothing is off limits, sir.                                                   Orion: Oh yeah... Ok... Then I want to...                                                           Calypso: Alright, Orion, the time has come! We must leave!                                          Orion: What?! No! GOD PLEASE NO!! Just give me five minutes!!! No—Four! Fuck it, I'll be done in two and a half!!                                                                                       Calypso: What? No! Do you have any idea how hard it is to keep this thing open?                     Orion: Well I’m having a hard time keeping this thing down!                                         Calypso: What thing? You are speaking nonsense! We must leave! You were rushing me just a minute    ago!                                                                                                Orion: I changed my mind! I have found my calling! I will stay in this server FOREVER!              Calypso: Alexandra and Nova must be on the other side already. Come on, we must get going!          Orion: ...Fuck! Where are we?!                                                                      Fox Maiden: What?                                                                                   Orion: I want to come back! What is this place?!                                                    Fox Maiden: Erm... it’s Mr. Hiromi's residence, sir.                                                Orion: No! The server! What's this server's name?!                                                  Fox Maiden: Oh... The server? It's called...                                                        Orion: No... ...No.... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!                                                    Player: Dude, stop yelling! I’m trying to craft in peace!                                           Orion: (Why am I so unlucky...)                                                                     Alex: *Out of breath* OH THANK GOD! WE’RE ALIVE!!                                                   Player: AGH!!! You made me mess up! Now it's ruined! Noobs nowadays... no respect for their         surroundings...                                                                                     Alex: *Out of breath* That was... way too close...                                                  Orion: *Turning around* ...Huh? Oh! Alex, it’s you! Thank god, at least you’re alright!             Alex: What’s wrong with you? Why do you look so upset?                                              Orion: Oh... um...                                                                                  Calypso: Two young females offered themselves unto Orion, so he is most likely upset he was forced  to leave them.                                                                                      Alex: What? What the fuck, Orion? Now? Seriously?! You were going to abandon us for a chance to get laid? You have no idea what Nova and I just went through!                                           Orion: No! I was... uhh... I was only roleplaying in that server... so we didn’t get caught.        Alex: Yeah, sure...                                                                                 Orion: Um... Oh, hey, look! An Exit Portal! We made it! We can finally leave!                       Alex: Wait... Where's Nova?                                                                         Calypso: Oh, heavens! She must have gotten lost again...                                            Orion: Well, shit. Did she end up in another server?                                                Calypso: Yes, I am afraid so... My deepest condolences. I am getting quite exhausted, as I am not   used to creating portals for other people... I must have lost my focus...                           Orion: Don't worry, Calypso, it's not your fault. Were the two of you together? Before coming here. Alex: Yeah, we were in a weird server where everyone looked like cartoons. Things... uhh... got a   bit out of hand, to say the least, and we were being chased until we saw a portal summoned in front of us.                                                                                              Orion: Maybe she stayed there?                                                                      Alex: After what that angry mob was threatening to do to us? Not a chance. I’m pretty sure we both  jumped in without hesitation.                                                                       Calypso: I am afraid my energy levels are running quite low. I do not have enough to craft a return portal to reunite her with us. Though, I do believe I possess enough energy to create one last      portal, which will only allow a single person to travel to her location. Since I got her into this  mess, I will use it, and then help her to locate one of those “Exit Portals” of yours. I am deeply  indebted to all three of you for saving me from captivity, so I will gladly help save her this time. At least we managed to teleport right next to an Exit Portal. Use it to go back to your world. Do  not worry about your friend, I will help her find her way home.                                     Go back to the real world                                                                           Orion: Alright then, let's go. We can't do much more. I can't wait for my head to finally hit my    pillow. I’m beat! You sure you're gonna be alright? What will you do after Nova goes back to the    real world?                                                                                         Calypso: I think I shall return here. This seems like a pleasant place to rest and plan ahead.      Go rescue Nova                                                                                      Orion: Hmm... Open the portal. But I'm going to be the one to use it. Nova and I will find an exit, don't worry.                                                                                        Calypso: You? Are you sure?                                                                         Orion: I am. I have a feeling you’re exhausting yourself more than you’ll admit. I know utilizing   your abilities after such a long time must be very taxing. You've done more than enough for us.     We'll manage! You two use that Exit Portal and go back to the real world. I'll find Nova and...     Alex: *Clears throat*                                                                               Orion: Hmm? What? What are you... Oh... (Holy shit, I completely forgot she's an NPC... She’s       definitely the most realistic AI I’ve ever seen. I can't bring myself to speak to her as if she     wasn’t a real person.) Sorry, I forgot you can't...                                                 Calypso: Yes, I am unable to travel to your world. I attempted to in the past by touching one of    those magic rings, but I do not disappear like you all. Simply nothing happens.                     Orion: Um... Do you have anywhere to go?                                                            Alex: Let me take care of that. This place is called “Ekabar” and happens to be a server I am pretty familiar with. Down this path there's an inn, and I am on good terms with the owners. Let's go     there together. I’m certain they’ll be willing to give you a room for free, as they are very kind   people.                                                                                             Calypso: Really? Thank you, Alexandra. I would be most appreciative of that.                        Alex: It is. I know this server, it's called "Ekabar". If you go down that path over there, you'll  find an inn with a sign shaped like a pony. Tell them I sent you and they'll give you a room for    free.                                                                                               Calypso: I'll do that. Thank you, Alexandra.                                                        Orion: Alright then, let's do it. Send me to wherever Nova is. I just hope she's still safe and     sound. Well, I hope you can find Nova and help her... if she hasn't found an Exit Portal on her own already. She’s sharp enough, so I wouldn’t doubt it.                                                Calypso: I am certain she is doing well. All three of you seem to be very skilled.                  Orion: Why thank you!                                                                               Alex: Some more than others.                                                                        Orion: *Laughs* I'll assume you're talking about yourself.                                          Alex: *Chuckles* Sure, sure.                                                                        Orion: So Calypso... I gotta ask... Would you like to join our team? We're good people. We could    help each other.                                                                                    Calypso: Normally I tend to be more independent, but after what I have witnessed so far... I think  we complement each other fairly well. So yes, Orion, I accept your proposition. I will be around if you need me. I mean... Not that I have a place to return to, anyways.                               Orion: You don't know how to... find your people? Your home?                                        Calypso: I have tried, but I cannot seem to sense it. And I am unable to open a door to a place that I cannot see. It is... difficult to explain. But maybe a few days of meditation will help me       remember. Thank you for everything, Orion.                                                          Orion: Anytime, Calypso. You are... not what we were expecting to find... like, at all. I’m just    glad you turned out to be much better than we could’ve hoped. We'll talk again soon. Good luck!     Well, time to say goodbye for now, Alex. I hope to find Nova next to an Exit Portal so we can log   off at last. Well, time to go back, Alex. I'm exhausted...                                          Alex: You know, today was the craziest, coolest, and definitely the most dangerous Eternum session  I’ve ever had.                                                                                      Orion: Well, start getting used to it. I seem to attract chaos wherever I go.                       Alex: *Chuckles* I'd be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy a bit of chaos myself.                       Orion: I'll... see you tomorrow at school?                                                          Alex: Yes, you will. Maybe I won’t miss as many classes from now on...                              Orion: Huh, is it because of me?                                                                    Alex: *Chuckles* Of course not. It's because of my brother. He's been extra cocky recently. Someone has to put him back in his place. *Chuckles* Of course not. It's because of my brother. He's been   extra cocky recently. Someone has to put him back in his place.                                     Orion: *Laughs* Fair enough. *Laughs* Fair enough. Take care, Alex. I'll see you at school, I guess. Take care. I'll see you at school, I guess. Take care.                                             Calypso: Alright, here goes my last portal... Are you ready, Orion?                                 Orion: Ready.                                                                                       Calypso: *Breathing slowly* Glem ni sa' eradin.                                                     Orion: Hmm... (A desert? Fuck, it's hot here. Quite the contrast from the last server. And windy... This bloody sand... keeps getting in my eyes... It’s so coarse, rough and irritating... I should    seek shelter in that temple until the sandstorm stops. I don't see any other place nearby, so Nova  must have gone that way too. Looks like an Egyptian temple... Please God... no mummies, traps, or   Pharaonic curses... I'm way too exhausted for that. Wow, this place looks amazing. Thankfully it's  not as hot in here.) Nova? Are you here? (I should take a look around... This place is so cool!     Everything in here is so detailed and intricate... I should return here on another day with one of  the girls. We could explore pyramids, plunder tombs of Pharaohs... Find a Cleopatra to bathe with... Oh yeah, that definitely sounds good. What the...) Nova?! *Kneeling down* Nova! Are you okay?!     Nova!! (Damn it, she seems to be unconscious. What the hell happened to her? And who the fuck is    this guy? Maybe they were fighting and knocked each other out at the same time? I don't see any     signs of a struggle, though. And what's this? A figure of a cat? It's covered with symbols carved   into the marble... looks pretty valuable. Weird, it's not as heavy as it looks. Maybe it’s hollow? I wonder if... Wait, why am I thinking about this junk when Nova is sitting there helpless? I better pick her up and get out of... H-Huh... All of a sudden I feel so... sleepy... Mmm... maybe just a   quick little nap...) *Collapsing to the ground* Huh...? Where am I... (What?! Shit, I blacked out!  It was a trap! Should’ve seen that one coming... why am I so gullible... Someone tied our hands     behind our backs... I can't move! Fuck! We're screwed...) Pssst! Nova! Novaaa! Come on, wake up!    Nova: Mmmm...? What happened...? Ah! Where am I?! What's going on? What the... Who tied me up?!     Orion: Ahh! I’m glad to see you’re okay, Nova.                                                      Nova: Orion, it’s you! It's so good to see you! Alex and I ended up in some weird server full of    cartoon characters!                                                                                 Orion: Yes, I saw Alex! She told me about it.                                                       Nova: Then we escaped through one of Calypso's portals and... I appeared here by myself! T-Then I   saw a man lying on the ground, so I approached him, and then... I don't remember anything else.     Orion: Yeah, the same thing happened to me.                                                         Avery: It's the c-cat!                                                                              Orion: What?                                                                                        Avery: Did you touch the cat?!                                                                      Orion: Y-Yeah.                                                                                      Nova: Me too!                                                                                       Avery: That thing must be cursed! When you touch it, you lose consciousness! It must be a trap to   protect the Pharaoh’s tomb!                                                                         Orion: Shit... What server is this?                                                                 Avery: What? You’re in the "Valley of the Kings". You don't even know what servers you log into?    Orion: Um... Well, it's a long story.                                                               Nova: But if the cat is a trap to protect the tomb... Who tied us up?                               Avery: I don't know! I just ended up here after following the clues!                                Orion: What clues?                                                                                  Maat: *Giggles*                                                                                     Avery: W-Who are you?! Let me go!                                                                   Maat: The Bastet Figurine. What an astounding discovery. There's something about it... I could sit  for hours just admiring its beauty.                                                                 Avery: B-Bastet? W-whatever, please, let me go!                                                     Maat: My name is Maat.                                                                              Orion: Maat? Like the Egyptian goddess?                                                             Maat: Well, well, well... Looks like the boy isn’t the typical sort of idiot to end up here... Yes, like the goddess.                                                                                   Nova: What did you do to us?!                                                                       Maat: The Bastet Figurine puts whoever touches it to sleep. It's impossible to wake up, until after 50 or 55 minutes... just in time to avoid Eternum's automatic disconnection.                        Orion: And how come it doesn't affect you?                                                          Maat: You become immune to its effects by wearing Sekhmet's Ornament – the green jewel on my        forehead. As I said... It's quite an amazing artifact. *Lights another torch* Welcome to my Oasis.  I’ve never had this many people follow my clues before. I'm kind of excited.                        Avery: Let me go, goddammit! I don't wanna play anymore!                                            Maat: I'm afraid that's not for you to decide. We can all leave when I, myself, have no desire to   play anymore. But I feel like playing right now... Don't you?                                       Avery: Please, cut me loose! I'm not into whatever this is! I just wanna go back home!              Maat: Easy, easy... No need to get so rattled. You're too tense, honey. What's your name?           Avery: *Groans* ...Avery.                                                                           Maat: You found this place by following my clues, didn't you?                                       Avery: I j-just wanted to have a good time. I only bought Eternum to escape the routine for a bit,  please don't hurt me!                                                                               Maat: Just like me! Real life is so boring... That’s why I just wanna have some fun. It’s why we’re all here, isn’t it? Why else would anyone be so willing to get an implant in their brain? If you    play with me, nothing bad will happen to you, I promise... And my, my... would you look at this!    What a cutie... I always thought of heterochromia as a very sexy trait.                             Orion: What the fuck do you want?! Let us go you crazy bitch!                                       Maat: Uhhh... Looks like your boyfriend is getting a little jealous. Jealousy is such a consuming   emotion. What's your name, sweetie?                                                                 Nova: N-Nova. And Orion isn't my boyfriend...                                                       Maat: Oh... really? That makes it even better...                                                    Orion: You're nuts, you know that? If you want to kill us, stop delaying and just get it over with. Maat: If I wanted to kill you, I would have done so already. I told you, I only want to have some   fun, nothing more... I'll be honest with you, Avery... The gear in your inventory was not very      impressive. Is this sword really your only weapon? It's not sharp at all... I think it might even be too dull to cut bread.                                                                             Avery: I spent all of my life savings to buy a neural implant! I didn’t have anything left over to  afford any better equipment...                                                                      Maat: So disappointing... *Sighs* Well, I’ll just check the girl’s bag then. I hope there's         something of value.                                                                                 Orion: *Whispering* She looted us?! *Whispering* F-Fuck, she's gonna find the Gem of Doom!          Nova: *Whispering* WHAT?! *Whispering* Are you kidding me?! The Gem of Doom you had was real??      Orion: *Whispering* Um... I'm not sure. It's possible.                                              Nova: *Whispering* So the other day... when the Founder announced another Gem of Doom had been      found... that was you?!                                                                             Orion: *Whispering* W-What announcement?                                                            Nova: *Whispering* One of Ulysses' public announcements! It was broadcasted on all the non-combat   servers! It was the second announcement in the last few days!                                       Orion: *Whispering* Oh shit... then it's possible it was me, yeah.                                  Nova: *Whispering* But... HOW? How the hell did you get your hands on one of the 10 Gems of Doom?   Orion: *Whispering* It's... a long story. I'll explain later. We can't let this crazy girl keep the Gem. Y-You’re gonna help me, right?                                                                 Nova: *Whispering* What are you talking about? Don’t you remember? Thanatos took it in Ogygia after he impaled you with his spear!                                                                      Orion: *Whispering* What?? T-Thanatos? Ogygia? *Whispering* So... So I've lost it forever? Awww...  you gotta be kidding me. I knew it was a bad idea for me to keep it. I don't know how I'm gonna tell Luna I lost the Gem. And Annie's gonna kill me...                                                  Maat: Well, well, well... Look at this! What a nice little gun...                                   Nova: *Gasps* Dione! D-Don't touch it, that's mine!                                                 Maat: Firearms are not allowed in this server... how did you manage to avoid that rule? This must be a very special weapon... Where did you buy it?                                                     Nova: That's none of your business! Now give it back to me!                                         Maat: Now, now... I only want to borrow it for a bit...                                             Nova: No!                                                                                           Maat: Man, such a tough crowd. How about we lighten the atmosphere? Let’s start off with a little   game. The rules are simple. If you can entertain me, you will be freed. If you can't, you will be   killed and thus lose all of your levels. Simple enough, right?! Do we have a deal?                  Avery: Please, let me go! I don't wanna be here!                                                    Maat: You’re really starting to sound like a broken record, Avery... Orion?                         Orion: *Sighs* Okay, we'll play your little game.                                                   Maat: *Giggles* Now that’s the spirit! Let the game begin! You two. Get hard.                       Orion: W-What?                                                                                      Maat: A boner. I wanna see it... First one to get hard wins!                                        Orion: (This girl is completely crazy...)                                                           Avery: You w-want me to what?                                                                       Maat: Oh, come on... Don't be shy now... Have I really said anything that strange? Level with me    here... the only reason we’re all on Eternum is to fulfill our fantasies of power... violence... and sex... To do the things we're too scared to do in the real world. So... you should be thankful, I'm really not asking for much...                                                                      Orion: Um... I'm not exactly in the mood right now, you know? It's difficult to get excited when    someone is pointing a gun at your head.                                                             Maat: Awww... Did you hear that, Nova? The boys are not in the mood... They sure don't make men the way they used to – wouldn’t you agree?                                                              Nova: Um... I d-don't know.                                                                         Maat: I think they’re gonna need a little help. From you.                                           Nova: H-Help...?                                                                                    Maat: Tell me, how long have you known Orion?                                                       Nova: A few days.                                                                                   Maat: Mmm... I bet he must be anxiously waiting to see what’s underneath those clothes of yours...  Nova: W-What?                                                                                       Maat: Do you think he'll get hard if you show him your body? To reveal the mystery of what’s        normally hidden to everyone else...                                                                 Nova: I... Um...                                                                                    Orion: Screw you! Fuck this bitch and her blackmail!                                                Nova: . . .                                                                                         Maat: Don't be rude, Orion. The ladies are having a conversation... What do you say, my ginger      friend? Showing off a bit of your spicy side... would that do the trick?                            Nova: I... Uh... I don't know.                                                                      Maat: Well, I’d say it’s worth a shot. Do a nice little striptease for us, and you'll be free to go.Orion: Nova, don’t listen to her. She’s nothing but a trickster.                                    Maat: Oh, please, Orion... I'm a woman of my word. I assure you, I can be trusted...                Nova: I d-don’t feel very comfortable with that. I’ve n-never done anything like that in front of   other people...                                                                                     Maat: Honey... I’m afraid you don’t have many other alternatives here...                            Nova: B-But... I... Um... Do you give us your word?                                                 Maat: Of course...                                                                                  Nova: I... Does Avery have to be here for this too...? I don’t really want him seeing–              Maat: What good is a show if there isn’t much of an audience to enjoy it? Avery stays.              Avery: I'm keeping my eyes closed, hun. I only have eyes for my wife anyways...                     Nova: Uh... Well then... I guess I will...                                                          Orion: What? N-Nova?                                                                                Maat: *Untying Nova's rope*                                                                         Orion: You don’t have to do this! We can come up with another way!                                  Nova: I... I can't lose that gun, Orion. It's... It's all I have. Without it, I am nothing.         Maat: Whenever you want to start, sweetie, the stage is yours. And don't even think about trying    anything funny. Or else, this gun that you seem to love so much... you’ll never see it again.       Nova: Okay, okay...                                                                                 Maat: Oh, and you probably noticed already, but conjuration and destruction spells are not allowed  in this Oasis, so there’s no point in using magic to escape.                                        Orion: (Fucking bitch... Where are the Praetorians when you need them? I'm pretty sure this sort of exploitation isn't allowed.)                                                                        Maat: You're a lucky one, Orion. Nova seems like a determined girl. Those are the best ones in bed. Believe me, I'm telling you from experience...                                                      Orion: (That damn jewel on her forehead... If I could get her to take it off, I could knock her down with that cursed figure. But first I have to steal Dione away from her. Or else, if we try         anything, she'll just shoot us. I must come up with a plan...)                                      Maat: What's the problem, Orion? You're gonna miss the show!                                        Orion: What? (Oh shit, is she really gonna do this?)                                                Nova: *Untying her necktie*                                                                         Orion: (Wow, I guess she really is doing it. Dione must mean more to her than I thought...)         Nova: *Loosening her belt*                                                                          Orion: (Okay, this isn’t exactly the situation where I’d have liked for this to happen, but... I'd  be lying to myself if I didn’t admit this feels sort of... thrilling.)                              Nova: *Looking away* . . .                                                                          Orion: (Now she’s stealing glances at me. Should I look away...? Is it wrong that this is turning me on? I mean... we're in a life-or-death situation here... In the game, at least. But at the end of  the day... I'm just a man... Hot damn, has Nova always had that ass?! That skirt sure did a good job hiding it... Wow. It may not be the biggest ass I've seen, but when compared to the petite         proportions of the rest of her body... Oh my god...)                                                Maat: You're thick in all the right places, sweetie! Those cheeks are begging for a good slap! Do   you work out, or is all that from good genetics and a nice pair of push-up leggings?                Nova: Um... I u-used to skate.                                                                      Maat: *Giggles* I'll have to try that myself... Come on, turn around. Let me see what you’ve been   hiding from us.                                                                                     Orion: (Damn...)                                                                                    Maat: Put those hands down! Let me and the boys have a good look!                                   Avery: No thanks. I'm good.                                                                         Orion: (Holy shit, she's hot as fuck... Look at those legs... What happened to all that confidence  she had on the other servers... it’s like it vanished in a matter of seconds. She seems so...       vulnerable now. God, and that mole on her chest is driving me crazy.)                               Nova: *Removes her pantyhose*                                                                       Orion: (I wish the situation was different. I'd love to get her down on the ground and start sucking her little nip–)                                                                                   Maat: *Rubbing your dick through your pants* Well, well, well... Orion is definitely enjoying the   show! And damn boy, are these pants lying to me?! I had no idea you were hiding such a huge piece of meat! *Standing up* What about you, though? Open up those eyes! Don’t make me force them open!     Ugh... you're still as soft as a maggot. Wife or not, I thought you would still admire the beauty of a woman. What is it? Her boobs too small? You're gonna hurt her feelings...                        Avery: Please, I don't wanna be here! Let me go!                                                    Maat: Ugh, is that all you ever say? You're such a bore, Avery. I'll give you one last chance. Are  you gonna suck it up and play with us, or not?                                                      Avery: Please, I just wanna go back home! Let m–                                                    Maat: Goddammit! This gun really is great! Optimal mix of minimal recoil and smooth firing... I can see why you want to keep it so badly now!                                                           Nova: . . .                                                                                         Maat: We're much better now without that buzzkill, don't you think?                                 Nova: I've done what you wanted, can we leave now?                                                  Maat: Almost... Go untie your friend. And while you’re down there, take off his clothes too. After  this, we'll be done.                                                                                Nova: W-What? Why me?                                                                               Maat: Because it's more fun that way! And you’ll be staring down this barrel if you try anything, so don’t get sneaky.                                                                                  Nova: *Sighs* Okay...                                                                               Maat: I'll go throw this waste of space in the canal. Sort of bummed the corpses don't disappear    until the player logs in again, but at least the alligators love it. Start untying him, babe, I'll  be right back...                                                                                    Orion: *Whispering* This is our chance, Nova! *Whispering* We must come up with a plan before she's back. There's two of us and only one of her!                                                        Nova: *Whispering* But she has Dione and we have nothing! *Whispering* And I don't know any spells, but even if I did, she said we can't use magic here.                                                Orion: *Whispering* Yeah, but I can knock her down with my bare hands. We'll take advantage of her  overconfidence and use it in our favor. *Whispering* I'll make something up to distract her. When I start talking about my... "magic dagger", you stand up and say that it's in your bag. *Whispering*  Dalia and I used a similar technique to defeat another cocky player in Ekabar, and it worked out    pretty well.                                                                                        Nova: *Whispering* Magic dagger?                                                                    Orion: *Whispering* Yeah. Don't worry, just follow my lead.                                         Maat: What are you two mumbling about? Come on now, remove his pants.                               Nova: What?? I have to do it?                                                                       Maat: Yes, you. After all, Orion looks pretty tired. Be a doll and give him a hand, would you       kindly? Oh, and remove your panties too, while you're at it. We don't want them to get dirty...     Orion: Well, we're naked now. Are you happy?                                                        Nova: *Removing your pants*                                                                         Orion: Enjoying this feeling of “power”? Have you had enough?                                       Maat: It is quite satisfying...                                                                     Orion: Now let us go! And give me back my dagger already.                                           Maat: Huh? Dagger? What dagger? You weren't carrying anything.                                      Orion: That's because it's only visible when its owner touches it. Tell her about it, Nova.         Maat: Hmmm... Are you trying to trick me?                                                           Orion: You can see it for yourself, if you don't believe me. Show her the dagger, Nova. . . .       Nova...? N-Nova?!                                                                                   Nova: You’re... massive...                                                                          Orion: W-What the fuck?! What's wrong with you?? This is not the time for your jokes!               Nova: Jesus Christ... It's throbbing too... Have you ever had sex with a girl? Is she still alive?  Orion: W-What?! Oh come on, d-don't exaggerate!                                                     Nova: That would break me in two... That's like...                                                  Orion: Nova, focus here!! Do you know where my dagger is?!                                          Nova: Did you get that hard... because of me?                                                       Orion: W-Well, what the hell was I supposed to do? I can't help it, and I'm not a monk alright?!    Nova: Whoa...                                                                                       Maat: *Giggles* You two are way more fun than I was expecting... Now, if you want your little gun   back, you have to do one last thing for me...                                                       Orion: What?! You said you'd let us go! You gave us your word! Fucking liar!                        Maat: That’s right, I said I'd let you go. But I didn't say anything about the girl's gun... I      always keep my promises, so you're free to go. But... if you want the gun, there’s only one more    thing left to do...                                                                                 Orion: Bah! You're a cheat! What the hell else do you want?!                                        Maat: *Giggles* I want her to wrap those rosy lips around that hard cock... and give you a nice, wet blowjob...                                                                                         Orion: What? You're...                                                                              Nova: O-Ok.                                                                                         Orion: . . . D-Did you just say... "Ok"?                                                            Nova: I um... can't lose Dione, Orion. So I'll... I'll do whatever it takes.                        Orion: But... Um... Are you sure about this?                                                        Nova: We’ve come this far. At this point... one step, more or less, won’t make a difference... And  w-we have no alternative. Do we?                                                                    Orion: Uhh... I guess not...                                                                        Maat: I already know the answer, but just because I want us to hear it straight from your mouth...  You've never done this before, have you?                                                            Nova: . . . Um... N-No.                                                                             Maat: Do you need any tips?                                                                         Nova: No!                                                                                           Maat: You have really juicy-looking lips. You're gonna do just fine. And I know you're dying to try it... hide it as much as you want, but I know you’re hungry for him. That’s the important part here. Oral sex is exponentially more enjoyable when the giving side savors it as much as the receiving   side...                                                                                             Nova: W-What are you talking about? I'm just doing this because you're making me!                   Maat: Heh, sure... of course...                                                                     Nova: You better give me my gun back after this.                                                    Maat: You can ask around. Maat always keeps her promises. *Chuckles* Well... You better start soon, baby. Don’t want him getting soft on you.                                                           Orion: It's unlikely...                                                                             Maat: *Chuckles* This might be the best show I've ever seen... I'll give you two some space...      Nova: *Slowly approaches*                                                                           Orion: (Oh god... I can feel her warm breath on me...) Are you sure you’re okay with this, Nova? We can... We can come back to get your gun another day. I wouldn't want you to...                      Nova: It's okay. It's alright... Why go through all that extra trouble? I would feel much better    leaving this place with Dione back in my possession. Satisfying the wishes of a nympho freak seems  like a small price to pay. *Gently pushes your dick with her cheek*                                 Orion: (Fuck, I'm rock-hard right now...)                                                           Nova: Hm, you don’t smell bad at all... *Starts licking your glans*                                 Orion: Oh g-god, that feels good.... Your tongue feels so soft... and warm...                       Nova: And you taste... just like your smell. Like you, but stronger.                                Orion: (I need to feel the inside of her mouth so bad...)                                           Nova: *Keeps licking* *Gently kisses your glans*                                                    Orion: (She drives me insane every time she looks me in the eyes...) Oh god, I can't bear the       teasing anymore...                                                                                  Maat: Fuck, you two are so hot...                                                                   Nova: I don’t know if I can fit it all in my mouth...                                               Orion: I'm sure you can... At least the tip... Try it...                                            Nova: Mmm....                                                                                       Orion: Oh, yeah...                                                                                  Nova: Like this?                                                                                    Orion: Yes... Oh... Just like that...                                                               Maat: Oh, fuck yes! This is so hot! Come on, baby... Take him a bit deeper now... There you go... Oh god...                                                                                             Nova: Mmmm...                                                                                       Orion: Oh my god, Nova...                                                                           Nova: Mmmmhh...                                                                                     Orion: You feel... so amazing... (She doesn't look like she's being forced to do anything... She’s  giving it her all... making my cock so wet and sloppy... I'm fucking loving it...)                  Maat: That's how you do it! Atta girl! This spectacle is pleasing the Pharaohs, Nova!               Nova: Mmm...                                                                                        Maat: Suck it deep, baby...                                                                         Orion: Oh, fuck yes...                                                                              Maat: I thought a cock of that size would be too much for your first time... But you seem to be     handling it so well...                                                                              Nova: *Gagging* M-Mmm...                                                                            Maat: I can see from here how her pussy is dripping wet, Orion. I think she's enjoying this moment  more than us...                                                                                     Nova: *Recovering her breath* Aghhh... That's... not true... I'm just... doing this... because...   you... are making me...                                                                             Maat: *Giggles* Of course! Just a little bit more, alright?                                         Nova: *Recovering her breath* A bit... more?                                                        Orion: Yes, please...                                                                               Nova: Ok... Mmm...                                                                                  Orion: Oh, Nova... (The way she glides her tongue along my shaft, while she continues to suck every bit of my cock... it feels amazing... And I love the gagging sounds she's making... They're driving me crazy...) You're incredible...                                                                   Nova: *Moaning* Mmmm...                                                                             Orion: Ahhh... Just keep it up...                                                                   Maat: You might deny it now, but I know this is not the last time you'll be doing this to him,      baby... You’re only going to crave it more and more... needing to feel him fill up your mouth every day... and you’re going to love each second of it...                                                Orion: (Oh god, I fucking hope so... I don't even remember where I am... Or why I came here... All I can focus on now... is her...) *Standing up* Ahhh, fuck yeah...                                    Nova: *Recovering her breath* Ahhh.... ahh... ahh... I need... a minute...                          Maat: You two are something else...                                                                 Nova: Ahhh... Ahh... Is this... enough?                                                             Maat: Almost... Just a little bit more...                                                           Nova: Why do you... enjoy this so much...?                                                          Maat: I get off on the feeling of power... And I love watching... Usually, I just settle for forcing my male visitors to jerk off, only to kick them out right before they finish. I never had the      chance to do this... And it's a million times better... Fuck... Look at what you're doing to me...  I'm so horny... *Fingering herself* Come on, keep going... Don't you wanna fuck her mouth, Orion?   Orion: I do...                                                                                      Nova: Fuck... my... mouth...?                                                                       Orion: You’ve got me dying for more. I want you to swallow every inch, Nova, so I can feel the back of your throat...                                                                                   Nova: *Giggles* You're so raunchy, Orion... But... Well... I guess we’ve already passed the point of no return...                                                                                       Orion: (Fuck yes...) *Gently placing Nova's head right in front of your dick*                       Nova: W-Wait! I can't take it all! M-My mouth is too small!                                         Orion: It’s alright, just take it as far down as you can comfortably go...                          Nova: B-But... Well, okay, I'll try...                                                              Orion: That's my favorite little hacker girl... just tap me on the thigh if it’s too much... Mmm,   come here...                                                                                        Nova: *Gagging* Hhhhmf!!                                                                            Orion: Aaaahh... yeah....                                                                           Maat: Oh my god... You're gonna be a pro, ginger girl...                                            Orion: Oh my fucking god, yes... (Her lips are wrapped around my dick so tightly... For someone with such a tiny mouth, she’s handling me like a champ...) You feel unbelievably good, Nova...          Nova: MMmmmmm...                                                                                    Orion: Aaaahhh... yes...                                                                            Maat: It’s like you two are perfectly synchronized...                                               Orion: Yes... (It really feels that way... The way she’s stuffing her mouth with as much of my cock as she can handle... I thought for sure she’d be choking by now... But she hasn’t asked me to stop  at all...)                                                                                          Nova: *Gagging* Ahmmmmm...                                                                          Orion: Ahhh... Looks like computers aren’t your only talent...                                      Nova: Mm-hmmm....                                                                                   Orion: Fuck, I'm gonna cum... I'm at my limit...                                                    Maat: Stop!                                                                                         Orion: W-What?                                                                                      Nova: *Gasping for air* AAAAaaaaahhh...! Oh my god...                                               Orion: W-What now...? Holy shit Maat, what a body...                                                Maat: You're done now. You're free to go. There's an Exit Portal just behind the temple, between two granite rocks. And you can take the girl's gun, I don't want it anymore. Thank you for playing with me. I hope you enjoyed the game.                                                                   Orion: What? But... I gotta finish now! You can't leave me hanging like this!                       Maat: Yes, I can, and I will. I dictate the rules in my own game. You're not allowed to cum,        unless...                                                                                           Orion: Unless?                                                                                      Maat: Unless you finish with me. Never in my life have I ever been so turned on. And my clumsy      fingers just aren’t satisfying me enough right now... You’ve filled up her mouth, but now I need    your big, fat cock to fill me up this time... I need you to fuck me... use every inch of you to     finally satisfy the hunger I have deep inside of me... I want you to destroy me...                  Leave this place                                                                                    Orion: I'm sick of your games.                                                                      Maat: Awww... Does that mean you're leaving?                                                        Orion: We both are. And better pray that you don’t ever cross our paths again. If you try to find   us, we'll report you to the Praetorians and you'll be banned from Eternum forever. You know very    well that what you're doing is against the General Code of Ethics.                                  Maat: But you enjoyed my game... Both of you did. Don't lie...                                      Orion: T-That's not the point. Get out of my sight, you crazy bitch.                                Maat: I have a feeling you'll be the talk of Eternum sooner rather than later. You have a... special aura surrounding you. Goodbye, Orion... You'll always be my most favorite playmate.                Orion: Whatever...                                                                                  Fuck Maat                                                                                           Orion: You're completely nuts.                                                                      Maat: *Giggles* Tell me something I don't know...                                                   Orion: So you want me to fuck you?                                                                  Maat: Yes I do... I want you to fuck me so hard... None of that gentle, lovey-dovey shit... I want  you to be rough... I want you to use me like a little–                                              Orion: *Pulling her arm* Come here, you psycho bitch...                                             Maat: YES! LIKE THAT!                                                                               Push her against the wall                                                                           Orion: I'm gonna teach you a fucking lesson.                                                        Maat: Yes...                                                                                        Pull her to the ground                                                                              Orion: Get down. Now.                                                                               Maat: *Removing her ornaments* ...Or what? What if I don’t...?                                      Orion: Trying to see for yourself?                                                                  Maat: *Giggles* Mm-hm...                                                                            Orion: I'm gonna teach you a fucking lesson...                                                      Maat: YES! That’s it! Give it to me!                                                                Orion: Shut the fuck up already! I'm gonna fucking tear you apart.                                  Maat: Yeah... Do it... Ravage me...                                                                 Nova: Oh my god, this sure escalated quickly... Um... You... You two go on and do your thing...     I'll... I'll be waiting outside.                                                                    Maat: I've been such a naughty girl... Teach me a lesson... Use every part of me for nothing but    your pleasure... Abuse me... I deserve it...                                                        Orion: I hope you're wet enough, cunt.                                                              Maat: I’m dripping for you... now pin me down and shove your rock hard cock inside of me already!   Give me every inch...                                                                               Orion: Now you'll see what happens when you don't listen...                                         Maat: Yeah... All of it... Don’t keep me waiting... Fuuuuuuuu–! *Giggles* Y-Yeah...! That’s it!     FUCK! Aaahh... Arghhh... Ahhhhh... *Panting* Oh my god...! AHHH....!                                Orion: Ahh... I thought a bitch like you would be looser... (Fuck, it feels amazing to be in        control... to be so dominant over her... I can feel how my dick is stretching her with every        thrust...)                                                                                          Maat: A-A-Aaahh... I... I... O-oh my ggga-ad...!                                                    Orion: What?                                                                                        Maat: Aaaahhh.... S-Sloo-aaw...!                                                                    Orion: I don't understand what you’re trying to say...                                              Maat: Aaahh... Y-You're gonna break me...                                                           Orion: Good...                                                                                      Nova: (Oh my god... Why am I still here? Why can't I stop looking? That looks so... intense... I    can't imagine being in her position. But it also looks so... arousing... I m-mean... Orion seems so powerful...)                                                                                        Maat: *Panting* Ahhh... ahhh... ahgh... You... you like that...?? How you shoved your hard c-cock   down her th-throat... And now you’re shoving that cock... deep inside my p-pussy...                 Orion: I do...                                                                                      Maat: Ahhh... Orion...                                                                              Orion: (F-Fuck, this is incredible... I'm hitting the deepest part of her... The feeling of her     thick thighs slapping against my body with each thrust... it feels so fucking carnal and            empowering... Watching her huge tits bounce as I slam inside of her... The way her ass feels as it  slaps against my hips with every thrust... it feels so fucking carnal and empowering... Seeing her  tiny waist from above... her body buckling as it gives way to all of me...)  (I can't believe I     haven't cummed yet... But I can feel it building... I’m almost there...)                            Maat: Hhhhgg... You're f-fucking me so h-h-hard...                                                  Orion: Ahh... This is what you were hungry for, right??                                             Maat: Y-Yeah... I'm.... Hggg... I... I c-can’t hold it in... I’m almost there... Keep f-fucking     me... just like that... Oh d-don't s-stoppp... pleeeease... AAaaaahh.... I'm... Gonna... Fucking... Cummmm–!! A-A-Aaa-a-agggghhh.... A-A-Aaa-a-agggghhh.... A-A-Aaa-a-agggghhh.... F-F-Fuuuuuuuck!!     *Removing her ornaments* Oh m-my g-god...! I c-can't even... *Collapsing to the ground* Jesus       fucking Christ... M-My whole body is... numb... I've never had an orgasm so strong in my life...    F-Fuck, it's still going... Aghhhhh... If this wasn't Eternum, I'd be sore for a week...            Nova: (Oh my god... That must have felt... so intense... I don’t look anything like that after I do my thing... hm...)                                                                                  Orion: Fuuuuck, after all that buildup, I can’t keep it in any longer... My balls are about to      explode...                                                                                          Maat: *Giggles* Give it to me, baby... cover me... I want to feel your hot seed all over my body... Orion: AAAAaaahhhh!!! Aaaaahh...                                                                    Maat: MMmmmm... You're a fucking beast... Just the way I like it... Mmmm....                        Orion: Thank you for this, Maat. It's been... amazing. I wasn't expecting to meet someone so        depraved today, but you won’t hear me complaining.                                                  Maat: Mm-hm...                                                                                      Orion: Maybe we should do it again some time...                                                     Maat: Mmmm...                                                                                       Orion: In the meantime, can you hold this for me, please? It's a present, so you remember us.       Maat: Mm-hmmm...                                                                                    Orion: Come on, take a look!                                                                        Maat: Hmm...? Huh...?! W-Wha... WHAT?! F-Fuck! Where's my jewel?! Shit, where's Sekhmet's Ornament?! *Standing up* Where did I drop it?!                                                                Orion: Your jewel? Do you mean the one I snatched from you while you were cumming? The one that’s   now tucked away in my pocket?                                                                       Maat: WHAT?! You son of a bitch! Give me my jewel back immediat... Imme... *Collapses* Zzzz...      Orion: Huh... This Bastet Figure sure is effective... How does it feel Maat... getting a taste of   your own medicine?                                                                                  Maat: Zzzzzzz...                                                                                    Orion: Yeah, that's what I thought. Let's get out of here. Um... Nova... are you alright?           Nova: Y-Yeah! I'm great! Don't worry!                                                               Orion: Erm... I'm sorry, I got pretty carried away. I don't know what came over me.                 Nova: No, no! It was a great plan! N-Nice job! After what you did to her she was so... Uhh... out of it, that she didn't see you taking her magic jewel. I guess she felt... I mean, I guess that must  have felt very... mind blowing. *Clears throat* Anyway! Yeah, good plan!                            Orion: That was... something else.                                                                  Nova: Y-Yeah, well, we didn't have much of a choice, did we? We're alive and I have Dione back in my hands, so... *Clears throat* Yeah, we did what we had to do! We made the right choice! Let's get   dressed and out of here. As much as I love Eternum, I wanna go back to the real world already!      Orion: Yeah, good idea. Let's go. Did you grab Dione?                                               Nova: Yep! Safely back in my possession! I... I also looted Maat's inventory. She was carrying...   250 eternals.                                                                                       Orion: 250 eternals? Hmm...                                                                         Steal Maat's money                                                                                  Orion: What a lucky break. Yeah, we're taking that. Thanks Maat! Alright, we're all set.            Don't touch the money                                                                               Orion: Bah. It's not worth the trouble. Let’s just leave it. I don’t want to cause any more trouble for us further down the road, if she were to seek revenge... We have enough enemies already. You    know, as much as I'd love to stay and see her face when she wakes up, we should leave before someone else arrives.                                                                                      Nova: Of course! Let me grab my blazer...                                                           Maat: Goodbye, ginger girl...                                                                       Orion: God, after being inside that temple for so long, I forgot about the scorching sun of this    server! It's sweltering out here... *Coughs* And this fucking wind still hasn’t let up!             Nova: AAAAAAAAaarghhh!!                                                                             Orion: *Turning around* Nova?! What happened?!                                                      Nova: S-Shit! My eye!                                                                               Orion: Oh fuck, that's true...                                                                      Nova: Aaaaargh... F-Fuck, I've been without a patch for too long... I forgot all about it, and when I came out of the temple, I looked straight into the sun... AAAaAaargh....!                         Orion: (Dammit, it kills me seeing her in pain like this.) Can you walk?!                           Nova: I d-don't know... I think my retina detached and is causing a hemorrhage...                   Orion: My god, that sounds so terrible! I’m so sorry Nova!                                          Nova: *Sobbing* F-Fuck, it hurts so much...                                                         Orion: I'll carry you back! Come on Nova, I know how strong you are! Maat said the Exit Portal was  close by! Just hold on for a little bit longer...                                                   Nova: O-Okay... I’ll try...                                                                         Orion: Look! There it is! We made it! God, I can't believe it's finally over. What a journey... It  feels like we've been playing Eternum for 2 months straight. Don't worry, Nova, you’ll be out of    this bright sun in no time.                                                                         Nova: T-Thanks, Orion. I wouldn't have found this thing without you. S-Sorry for making you carry   me.                                                                                                 Orion: Oh please, it’s not a problem at all. You must weigh like... 90 pounds? I've carried         backpacks that weigh more than you! I'm just so sorry about your eye.                               Nova: Don't worry, everything will be alright once I've disconnected from Eternum. As long as this  doesn't happen to me in real life, I won't lose my eye.                                             Orion: It'd be such a shame to lose that beautiful, blue eye of yours.                              Nova: Oh, by the way... I haven't had the chance to thank you for rescuing me. N-No one has ever    done anything like that for me. Thank you, Orion. I owe you one.                                    Orion: You don't owe me anything. Let’s not forget how many times you’ve saved my ass as well. Seems like we just make a great team.                                                                    Nova: I... I always wanted to be part of a team.                                                    Orion: Well, you're part of one now!                                                                Nova: *Clears throat* And speaking of teams... We shouldn't talk about what happened back there,    right?                                                                                              Orion: Oh... You mean the...? Yeah, of course, let's just keep it between us.                       Nova: Good, good! That's what I thought. That was so scary! Maat was crazy! She definitely would’ve killed both of us. Probably better not to talk about it ever again. We should just forget what      happened.                                                                                           Orion: ...Yeah, that sounds like the smartest move.                                                 Nova: But just before we stop talking about it forever... I wanted to ask... How... H-How... how was it...?                                                                                             Orion: What do you mean?                                                                            Nova: I mean... Well, you know... How did I do... With... the b-b-blowjob.                          Orion: Oh... Well, seeing as we’re never going to talk about it ever again... And, you can take my  word with a grain of salt, because I’m not very experienced with that sort of thing, but... I'll    just say... you were fucking incredible. I've never felt something like that, ever in my life. The  way you just... agh! I can’t even describe it.                                                      Nova: O-Ok. Good. I mean... y-yeah, cool, I guess. Cool. Cool, cool, cool. Um... *clears throat*    O-Okay, let's go! Back to the real world!                                                           Orion: *Chuckles* *Removing your visor* (Oh my fucking god. That was... wow. I'm exhausted...)      *Looking at your phone* (05:25 AM... I have to get up in less than two hours to start getting ready for class... Oh god... What a day...) *Yawns* (Tomorrow... or I guess today... is gonna be a looong day... The Water Butterflies. They only live in Kredon... or so I’ve heard. I know I haven't seen   them anywhere else. They always come out after the rain, as if they appeared from nowhere, and then resume hiding before the rain returns. As a kid, I remember chasing them, in hopes of finding where they sheltered during the rain. Never did find out, though. Dalia even stood in the pouring rain    once, because she thought she finally found their hiding place. But Nancy always used to tell us    about the popular legend from Kredon...) “You'll never find their hiding spot – because it doesn't  exist!” “The Water Butterflies come from the puddles of rainwater.” “When nature signals for their  return, they evaporate and turn into the clouds above. And when enough clouds litter the sky, it    rains again.” “That's why it's always raining in Kredon!” “And the cycle of the Water Butterflies   will never cease, until they find what they're looking for...” (Hmm. That's actually a nice little  tale. I wonder what they're looking for...)                                                         Dalia: I thought they kicked out all the hobos that were sleeping in this park!                     Orion: *Chuckles* I’ll have you know, I wasn’t sleeping! I was just... chillin'. I hadn't seen the  sun all week, and boy, it sure does feel good against my skin.                                      Dalia: Oh, but you were on the verge of falling asleep... I can tell from your eyes.                Orion: Nah... I don’t need to sleep out here. I tricked a Kredon family into letting me live in     their house for a whole year. They set me up with a bed to sleep in, too, so no park benches for    me!                                                                                                 Dalia: Ohh... really? They must be very foolish.                                                    Orion: Oh yeah, they are. Especially the youngest daughter. She's extremely naive and easily        manipulated. She’s like a puppet, while I’m there pulling all the strings. She doesn’t even realize it!                                                                                                 Dalia: *Laughs* Fuck off.                                                                           Orion: Do you want to sit down with me for a bit?                                                   Dalia: Hmmm... I don’t know... I would hate to be further manipulated by you. I think I should be   finding some scissors to cut these strings of mine now.                                             Orion: *Chuckles* Perhaps.                                                                          Dalia: *Chuckles* Fine, you win, Mr. Puppet Master. But only because I don’t want to take this sun  for granted. Now scooch over. *Laughs* Come on, cut the shit. Scooch over.                          Orion: Ahh, the weekend – at last! What are you doing around here so early in the morning?          Dalia: I'm supposed to meet Alex at this park. We're going to swim together.                        Orion: Oh, cool! Does that mean your back is already healed?                                        Dalia: I think so! It doesn't hurt anymore. But I thought it'd be better to take it easy until the  competition, so something more low impact like swimming will do me good.                            Orion: The competition is next Thursday, right?                                                     Dalia: Yep! Thursday at 05:00 PM, at Kredon's gym.                                                  Orion: Nice. I'll be there.                                                                         Dalia: Are you participating?                                                                       Orion: Well, maybe, but I'll probably make a fool out of myself. I'm mostly going to cheer you on.  I’m allowed to do that, right?                                                                      Dalia: *Chuckles* You sure are!                                                                     Orion: I'll be your loudest fan, I promise!                                                         Dalia: Don’t forget to bring your pom-poms! I’m expecting some amazing chants!                      Orion: Cool. Can I go?                                                                              Dalia: Nah, sorry, but I’d rather you not. You'd only make me nervous.                              Orion: Well, alright... As you prefer. Oh, by the way, weren't you going to play Eternum with Nancy today?                                                                                              Dalia: Yeah! After lunch! Or... maybe in the evening. I've been looking forward to it all week, but Mom’s work has kept her pretty busy. I still can't believe she managed to buy a neural implant for  only $100! I think I'll bring her to Semper Invicta, a Roman-themed server that I visit frequently. Orion: Roman server?! I love Rome! Can I join too?                                                  Dalia: If you're expecting an epic battle, you can forget about it. It's a pretty chill server for  roleplaying. I thought it'd be the best option for Mom's first time in Eternum.                     Orion: Oh, that makes sense. But still, I wanna tag along!                                          Dalia: Um... Okay, sure, why not. Just tell me when you wanna play, or text me if I'm not home.     Orion: Will do! And what about Penelope? Her neural implant arrived yesterday, right?               Dalia: Hell yeah! I don't know how in the world you convinced her to buy it, but I’m not            complaining.                                                                                        Orion: I heard she bought herself an implant, right?                                                Dalia: Hell yeah! I don't know who convinced her to buy it, but I’m not complaining.  Mom, Penny,   and I... all playing Eternum?! That’s a dream come true! And with Annie and you too? Now that’s what I call a party! *Giggles* Can't wait to kick Penny's ass in a fight!                               Orion: *Laughs* I'm pretty sure she's not gonna want to fight you. And besides...                   Dalia: H-Holy shit, Orion! You've got some reflexes!                                                Axel: Reflexes? That sloth didn't even see it coming. I just chose to kick a curve ball...          Dalia: What do you want now, Axel?                                                                  Axel: Nothing. Can't I kick a ball in my fucking park?                                              Dalia: This isn't your park, and... *sighs* Can't you just leave us alone?                          Axel: Shut the fuck up, bitch. I don't wanna talk to you.                                           Orion: Take that back, moron. Your problem is with me, not her.                                     Axel: Don't worry, I’m not going to waste time on your whore anymore.                               Orion: Can't you leave me in peace, once and for all? Is it really that hard for your pea-sized     brain to comprehend? Or do I need to rattle that hollow skull of yours with a five-fingered         delivery?                                                                                           Axel: Yeah, keep up with those empty threats. It'll only make the payoff so much sweeter.           Orion: Speaking of making idle threats, it's been over a week already, and I haven't been expelled  yet. Maybe you and your father aren’t so powerful after all.                                        Axel: *Laughs* Expulsion? No, I have something much better prepared for you. Just wait... You'll see soon enough.                                                                                       Orion: Yeah, sure... I can hardly contain my excitement.                                            Dalia: Is "Miss Saggy Tits" going to say something, or is she only here to sniff your ass and follow you around, like the good puppy she is?                                                            Charlotte: What the fuck are you talking about, bitch?! I don't have saggy tits!!! Stop spreading   that rumor!                                                                                         Dalia: They almost hang down to your knees, Charlotte. If you want some friendly advice, exercise   your pectorals and watch your posture – it'll help.                                                 Charlotte: Shut the fuck up!!                                                                       Axel: Whatever... Remember this, newbie. I'll find out what happened with Benjamin, you can be sure. And when I do, you and your fucking... AAAaaargh....                                               Alex: Oh my god, I'm so sorry, bro! I was trying to kick that soccer ball, but I just missed it!    Man, you probably think I’m such a klutz now...                                                     Axel: F-Fuck you, Alexandra...                                                                      Alex: What? Are you sobbing? Don't tell me I’ve damaged the Bardot royal raisins!                   Axel: Y-You're a fucking disgrace to the family...                                                  Alex: Yeah, I get that a lot. Hey Charlotte, good to see you. I gotta admit, that’s a nice bra,     girl! Really applauding their titanic effort in keeping up those saggy tits of yours.               Charlotte: I DON'T HAVE SAGGY TITS!!! STOP SAYING THAT!                                             Alex: Man, I wish I was as confident as you are. Really an admirable trait!                         Charlotte: SHUT UP!                                                                                 Alex: 'Sup girl. Hey Orion. Are you ready to swim?                                                  Dalia: Sure am! Just don't ask too much of me today. I still want to take it easy on my back.       Axel: *Standing up* What are you doing with these people, Alexandra? Are you friends with the       lowlives now?                                                                                       Alex: Oh, you didn't know? I'm sorry, I thought I told you about it. Orion and I are fucking. Like  rabbits. Speaking of which, you should probably change your bedsheets. Last time, heh... I’ll spare you the details, but let’s just say Orion calls me his lil' super-soaker now.                       Axel: Ha, ha. Very funny, Alexandra. Seriously.                                                     Alex: I couldn’t help it, I swear! But I mean, what can a girl do when she’s being ravaged by a man packing 8 inches of pure salami! You should see that thing, bro. Just for science. It's huge! And... god, what he can do with his tongue too... After we're done, it takes me awhile to descend back    down to earth.                                                                                      Orion: (Man, I wish we were really doing that...)                                                   Axel: . . . You're lucky I know she's kidding. But you better stay away from her, loser.            Alex: Awww... my dear brother worries about me! That's so sweet!                                    Axel: S-Shut up! It's about the family's reputation! You've messed it up enough. You're messing up  the family's reputation.                                                                            Alex: Fuck you and fuck the family's reputation. I can do whatever the hell I like. Oh, and on that note, I'm moving out by the end of the month. Not joking this time.                                 Axel: Moving out? How? Dad's not gonna give you a cent.                                             Alex: I have a job to earn my own money. Unlike you, I'm not some pathetic daddy's boy. Now fuck    off. You're boring me already.                                                                      Axel: Bah. Let's get out of here. I'll be watching you, cocksucker.                                 Orion: Fuck you. Damn, Alex. You sure know how to put him in his place. Damn, Alexandra. You sure   know how to put him in his place.                                                                   Alex: Yeah, well, we’ve lived together for 18 years. I know how to handle him. He’s full of talk,   but always chickens out in the end. Anyway, I don't wanna talk about him anymore. Let's change the  subject. Is your back fully recovered, girl?                                                        Dalia: Yep. It turns out Orion has some magical massage hands.                                      Alex: Oh, really? Well he’ll have to put those hands to work on me, one of these days.              Orion: It'd be my pleasure. It’d be a shame to not share my talent with the world.                  Alex: That's... cool, I guess.                                                                      Dalia: Yep, I'm ready to get back into action! We're playing in a Classical Era server later today. Do you wanna join us?                                                                               Alex: Classical Era?                                                                                Dalia: Yeah, Roman style. We're playing with my mom. It's gonna be her first time. I know it might  sound a little lame... playing with your own mom, but trust me, she's cool.                         Alex: Nah, I think that’s actually awesome she’s willing to try it out. I totally would join, but I can't because I have work today. Sorry. Just a couple more weeks and then I'll have enough to rent a small apartment.                                                                                   Dalia: Oh sweet! You better invite me to the housewarming party.                                    Alex: *Chuckles* Count on it. By the way, before we leave, I wanted to ask... Have you discovered   anything else about that... Eternum "magic" of yours, Orion?                                        Orion: Actually... yeah! I'm making some progress. I can... activate it sometimes. But... not       whenever I want. And when I am able to summon it, I feel much faster and stronger, but I still can’t fully control it. This entire week, Dalia and I have been training together in Eternum, as soon as we get home from school. If we keep it up, I think I’ll get the hang of it in no time.              Alex: Oh... training, huh? Is he a good apprentice?                                                 Dalia: Well... Let's try again. You should be taking a small breath with every punch. Remember to   exhale sharply with every hit. You need to establish a good rhythm.                                 Orion: That's easy for you to say. I can’t keep track of all these things I’m supposed to be doing  in the moment! Especially when someone is hitting me in the face.                                   Dalia: Hey, the only way to learn is to keep practicing! After a while, it’ll be second nature to   you.                                                                                                Orion: Are you gonna be just as tough with Nancy too?                                               Dalia: Mom? Oh shit, I wouldn't dare! I guess you haven't seen her kickboxing at the gym...         Orion: Oh yeah, she told me about her classes. Alright, now I'm scared.                             Dalia: You have to train hard if you don't want to be left behind! Come on, let's try the eyes      thing. Do you think you can activate it?                                                            Orion: Um... I'm not sure. But I’ll try.                                                            Dalia: Be my guest.                                                                                 Orion: *Inhaling* *Exhaling*                                                                        Dalia: Wow... You did it! You look scary... I’ve never seen anyone with magic like that. Now I want it too!                                                                                             Orion: I... I c-c-can't... My h-heart... is b-beating... too fast... I c-can't think straight...    Dalia: Calm down. Remember our training. Focus, and take a deep breath.                             Orion: Aghhh... I... I’m h-hearing... everything. I’m seeing... everywhere at once...               Dalia: What are you seeing?                                                                         Orion: I... I can see... layers to everything... I... I don't know how to explain it. It’s like, I’m not seeing any colors, but at the same time... I’m seeing all of them at once... I can hear the    whispers of everybody throughout the server... as if I’ve had all my senses suddenly sharpened. I   feel... a pressing need to move forward... I feel stronger...                                       Dalia: Ok, that's... weird. Now I'm starting to believe your claim about having 100% compatibility. Maybe your brain is... intertwining with Eternum's code somehow? Improving your base stats and      skills? I don't know. Anyway, let's try to fight again. Attack me.                                  Orion: W-What?                                                                                      Dalia: Attack me. I wanna see your strength.                                                        Orion: N-No. I can't... control it. T-Turn around.                                                  Dalia: Nah. It's more interesting this way. I want to improve my reflexes too.                      Orion: I... I don't want to kill you.                                                               Dalia: Come on! Less fright, more bite!! I'm waiting...                                             Orion: Alright... You asked for it... Don't say I didn't warn you... Ouch....                       Dalia: See? That's your problem. You're stronger than me, but you don't know how to use that        strength properly. You're too impulsive. You just charge forward without studying the situation     at-hand. You gotta think before you act!                                                            Orion: Hmmmm...                                                                                     Dalia: *Giggles*                                                                                    Orion: Damn it.                                                                                     Dalia: Your upcoming moves are too obvious, so it's easy to come up with a counter. With your       fighting style, I believe your best strategy would be to focus on the counterattack. Adopt the      combat stance I taught you, and wait for your opponent to strike a few blows while you just dodge as many as you can. Analyze their moves, find their weak point, wait for them to strike... and then   hit them before they can hit you! One second can mean the difference between life and death. In     Eternum, there are no second chances. And remember to breathe!                                      Orion: Ehh... I'll try it.                                                                          Dalia: Come on, let's log off. It's pretty late already and I could go for a snack. Plus, you must  be tired.                                                                                           Orion: Log off? No fucking way! LET'S START FROM THE TOP!                                           Dalia: *Giggles* That's the attitude I was looking for! So... Yeah, I think he has the potential to become a great fighter.                                                                             Orion: I've been training this week after school, in Eternum. I'll soon get the hang of it.         Dalia: Good luck with that. Maybe the next time we get a Gem of Doom, you’ll actually be able to    hold onto it.                                                                                       Orion: Hey, that's not fair! You know it was Thanatos who took it from me! How am I supposed to     defeat the world’s best Eternum player, with no experience at all?! And Nova and Alex were there    too! Why am I the only one to blame?! And Nova and Alexandra were there too! Why am I the only one  to blame?!                                                                                          Dalia: *Laughs* I know, I know, I was just kidding. Anyway, shall we go?                            Alex: Sure. Um... I made some protein bagels. Do you want one?                                      Dalia: Food!                                                                                        Orion: You... made? Like... you baked them?                                                         Alex: Yeah.                                                                                         Orion: Can you cook too?                                                                            Alex: No. I mean... well, kinda. Sometimes. Usually. What if I do?? Is there a problem with that...?Orion: Of course not! It's just, I wasn't expecting that from you. But I guess that’s a very        important skill to have if you plan on living on your own.                                          Dalia: What about me?! *Stomach grumbling* Can I have one?                                          Alex: Of course.                                                                                    Dalia: MmMmm...! Oh mmy mgod! So mgood!                                                             Orion: *Eating the bagel* Mmm, yeah, this is so tasty! Are you sure these aren’t store-bought?!     Dalia: *Swallows* Delicious! And you said they were protein bagels?                                 Alex: Yeah, I usually eat a couple before training. It's made with Greek yogurt, walnuts, seeds, and of course, protein powder.                                                                         Dalia: I might have to steal your recipe! I usually whip up a snack before I train too, but I make  protein brownies. Orion ate a couple the other day. Weren't they good?                              Orion: Hell yeah! They were delicious.                                                              Alex: Oh... better than my bagels?                                                                  Orion: Oh, come on, don't do this to me. They're both good in their own way! Same-same, but         different.                                                                                          Alex: Yeah, yeah, but... if you had to choose, which pre-workout snack would you eat?               Orion: You're evil.                                                                                 Dalia's brownies                                                                                    Orion: Um... well, choosing only from personal taste preferences, and not from judging by culinary  skills... Maybe Dalia's brownies. I’m a sucker for chocolate!                                       Dalia: *Giggles* Don't worry Alex, I'll teach you how it's done some other day. In the meantime,    keep practicing!                                                                                    Alex: Hmm.                                                                                          Alex's bagels                                                                                       Orion: Um... well, choosing only from personal taste preferences, and not from judging by culinary  skills... Maybe Alex's bagels. I love that hole-y goodness.                                         Alex: *Giggles* I'm sorry Dalia, but hey, at least you tried. You can't be the best at everything,  you know! But keep practicing!                                                                      Dalia: Hmmm... Well, we gotta go. Are you headed home now?                                          Orion: Yep.                                                                                         Dalia: Cool, remember to text me later if you want to play Eternum with me and Mom!                 Orion: I will. Have fun! And don't over-exert yourself! Don’t forget, your competition is right     around the corner!                                                                                  Dalia: I woooon't! Cool, I'll catch you later.                                                      Alex: Goodbye, Orion... Bye.                                                                        Dalia: *Walking away* So... is Orion also allowed to call you "Alex" now?                           Alex: *Walking away* Huh? Oh, yeah. He's cool.                                                      Dalia: *Walking away* I see...                                                                      Orion: (I like seeing the more friendly side of Alex. At least towards me. It’s a nice contrast to  when we first met each other. And Dalia has also been very nice to me all week. Thankfully, she     seems to have forgotten about the bathroom incident... Anyway, I should get back home. Well, I      should get back home. The Water Butterflies have all disappeared, and that can only mean one        thing... Yep, the rain couldn’t leave us alone for too long... Just in time to ruin my weekend.     Although... I was gonna spend the whole day playing Eternum anyways, so I guess it doesn't really   matter much. And at least I was able to make the most of the morning sun.) *Sneezes* (Let's get     inside. I should call Nova. Last time we spoke, she told me she was trying to locate a new Gem of   Doom. Maybe she found something.)                                                                   Annie: *Muttering*                                                                                  Orion: Hmm? (Is that Annie in the kitchen? We haven't talked since that... night. It's so hard to   find her alone. She's constantly talking with Dalia, Nancy, or Penny, and when I try to talk to her, she always manages to slip away for something. Maybe now's my chance...)                           Annie: What? What night? What are you... Ohhh...! You mean that time in your room, after the scary  server? *Laughs* I forgot all about it! It was just a night like any other. No biggie. Psh. No      sweat, heh. . . . Not a worry in mah noggin’, homie. I just be... chillaxin’ all day! Yeahhhh...    (Hmmm... okay, maybe that’s a little much. I’m overthinking it. Keep it simple, Annie!) Oh damn,    yeah... that was wild, huh. I don't even know how that happened, haha! I was... uhh, drunk. Very    drunk! I drank so much alcohol... with all those hops in the beer and, umm... I don't even          remember... (Hmmm... No, that won’t work either. Who am I kidding! He knows I don’t drink.) I was... too scared. Yeah. I wasn't thinking clearly, and I got carried away in the moment. Hmm... (Yes,    that's probably the best one. And it's not far from reality, actually.) What do you think, Carolyn? Carolyn: *Meows*                                                                                    Annie: (Yeah, we'll go with that. I'll call him today. Later. Maybe tomorrow. Or perhaps when it’s  not raining. Could cause bad reception, y’know. Or maybe...)                                        Orion: Good morning, Annie!                                                                         Annie: Hgggg...! Um... Oh! Orion! Good morning! I d-didn't hear you come in. I thought you were out.Orion: Yeah, I was. I wanted to take a walk while the sun was still out. What are you up to?        Annie: N-Not much. I was just watching the rain from the window. Thinking about... Um... thinking   about... Dalia! Yeah. Dalia. *Nervous laugh* We played together the other day and I... uh... touched her butt by accident. What a funny turn of events, haha! She has a great ass, though. Have you seen it? It's... really great. Quite the... juicy... um, booty... Yeah.                                 Orion: . . . Welp...                                                                                Annie: *Clears throat* Anyway, I gotta go! See you tomorrow!                                        Orion: No! You've been avoiding me all week! We need to talk!                                       Annie: About Dalia’s juicy booty? Sure, it's great! One hell of an ass!                             Orion: No! About us! About what happened the other night!                                           Annie: Ohhh... of course, yeah, that was crazy. But no biggie. I was scared. Not thinking clearly.  Don't worry, it's already forgotten.                                                                Orion: Look, Annie... (What should I do now?)                                                       Let this go                                                                                         Orion: (She's right. Forgetting about this might be the best option right now. And I'm sure         everything will return to normal in a few days. That's all I want... just to stay friends with her.) That’s uh, perfect! Because it’s already forgotten for me too! I'm gonna play Eternum today. Will  you be joining?                                                                                     Annie: Nah, I can't... We have a big test next week, and I have to spend all weekend chained to my  desk, studying... But thanks for the offer! Maybe let’s try next week! I still want to show you my  abilities!                                                                                          Orion: That sounds great. Take care, Annie!                                                         Annie: Thank you, Orion. I needed this talk. I'm going to study now. Have fun!                      Orion: See you later!                                                                               Tell her you like her                                                                               Orion: *Taking a deep breath* (Well Orion, it's now or never. Time to grow a pair and man up!) I’m  just going to be completely transparent with you. Because you deserve honesty and I’m tired of      trying to hide the fact... The fact that... I like you, Annie. I like you a lot.                    Annie: W-W-What?                                                                                    Orion: I've liked you ever since we were 10. If I’m being real with you, the only reason why I was  willing to come back to Kredon at all was because you were coming too.                              Annie: Oh geez!                                                                                     Orion: You're my best friend.                                                                       Annie: Oh no.                                                                                       Orion: And in my heart I know, I want us to be so much more than that, too...                       Annie: Oh my!                                                                                       Orion: What happened the other night was... amazing. I wouldn't trade that special moment we shared together, for anything in the world. Ever. But... I agree with you. It definitely was crazy! Totally unexpected! And, as much as I loved that night, I know things might’ve felt like they were moving  way too fast for you. So why don’t we apply the brakes, take a step back, and act as if it didn’t   happen.                                                                                             Annie: Yeah!! That's exactly what I want!                                                           Orion: Cool! I don't want to lose our friendship, Annie. I’d be miserable without you in my life.   Annie: M-Me too! I m-mean, I don’t want to lose you either! I just want us to stay friends forever! Orion: So... (Jesus, why am I so nervous right now?!) On that note... and with my earlier           confession... Are you free this Sunday?                                                             Annie: This Sunday? N-Not really, we have a big test next week, and I have to spend all weekend     glued to my textbooks... You know how I have to study much harder than you...                       Orion: No worries! I totally get it, it's probably the smarter thing to do if you want to nail the  test. What about next weekend?                                                                      Annie: Next weekend? Y-Yeah, sure, I'm free. Why?                                                   Orion: Nice! I'll prepare some food. Or we could go to a nice restaurant. Maybe see a movie         afterward. Not a horror one, though! Haha! I'll think of something.                                 Annie: That sounds great! Just spending some time together as good friends. Like how we’ve always   done it! Is Chang coming too?                                                                       Orion: No, Chang isn't coming. Why would he be joining us... On our date...?                        Annie: Our... d-date...?                                                                            Orion: Yeah. Our date!                                                                              Annie: Umm... like a d-date... date?                                                                Orion: *Chuckles* Yeah, exactly like a date date.                                                   Annie: With me?                                                                                     Orion: Mm-hm.                                                                                       Annie: Like... a fun date between friends?                                                          Orion: Hmmm... no, more like a date with a girl that I like. And I just happen to be so lucky in    that, she’s also my best friend too. As for what the future holds? Who knows...                     Annie: Oh my g-god. So... we are going on a DATE.                                                   Orion: W-well, that is, only if you want to–                                                        Annie: YES. Er, I mean, yeah! That sounds... nice! We have a d-date next Sunday!                    Orion: We have a date next Sunday!                                                                  Annie: Oh my god. I... I gotta go. I have to go study! I need to be free next weekend!              Orion: Sounds good!                                                                                 Annie: Look, Orion, I know we’re going on a date date, but I really do want to take it slow too. I  don’t want you to assume that–                                                                      Orion: Of course! No pressure at all. When I said I liked you, I really just wanted to get that off my chest. And I’m glad I did, because I feel much better now! So please, don’t feel like you’re     being forced to reciprocate... there’s no need to be nervous!                                       Annie: No need to be nervous. And not a word to anyone. I mean... there's no need for it, really.   We’re just two people going on a date, and there’s no need to overthink it.                         Orion: Indeed, indeed.                                                                              Annie: Ok. Cool! Then it's settled! T-Thank you, Orion. I needed this talk. I'm... going to study!  Do you have any plans for today?                                                                    Orion: Eternum is calling my name! And I’m going to answer that call, all day long!                 Annie: Ahhh, I'm so jealous!                                                                        Orion: This week, I’ve only been able to play some short sessions with Dalia. So I’m really looking forward to playing a lot more today!                                                                Annie: Ah, that sounds great! Dalia's a good fighter! And what a great wagon she’s draggin’! A      beautiful ass!                                                                                      Orion: Um... yeah, I guess she does have that...                                                    Annie: I... don't know why I said that. I'm nervous. *Clears throat* Alright, have fun!             Don't risk it                                                                                       Orion: You too! See you later!                                                                      Annie: Later!                                                                                       Kiss her                                                                                            Orion: Hey, wait a second, I wanted to ask you something before you leave.                          Annie: What is it?                                                                                  Orion: Come close, it's a secret.                                                                   Annie: Ok...                                                                                        Orion: I know you want to take things slow. And I’m perfectly okay with that. But I gotta say... I  really want to kiss you right now.                                                                  Annie: . . . M-Maybe... Maybe you should...                                                         Orion: (Her lips, although trembling a little, feel so soft and warm... It's the first time I’ve    felt her lips on mine, and yet, now I feel like I’ve been missing this feeling my entire life.)     Annie: . . . *Giggles* Oh my god. That was quite the goodbye for just a couple of... friends.       Orion: *Chuckles* Yeah, I guess. I'm sorry, I...                                                    Annie: No, no! It was amazing...                                                                    Orion: Definitely better than your first... thighjob.                                               Annie: *Giggles* Definitely better. Um... I really have to go study now. S-See you around!          Orion: Sure!                                                                                        Annie: *Giggling as she goes up the stairs*                                                         Orion: (Damn! I don't know where I got the courage to do all that. Looks like my luck is changing!  I’ve only been in Kredon for just a few weeks and already so many things have happened to me! Hmm... Where could we go for our date? Maybe a good movie? Or a walk along the beach. Or even a date in   Eternum! How about something related to Dalia's butt. She seems obsessed with it, for some reason... Did she really call it a juicy booty? Anyway, I'll think about it next week. There's still plenty  of time ahead. I made the best decision for the both of us. Or so I hope. Anyway... Now it's Eternum time, baby! I can't wait to dive back into the universe. Who knows what surprises await me! But    first, I gotta call Nova. Let's see if she has some news... That’s weird. Last time I called, she   answered in an instant. She's probably busy... Doing other things... Maybe she forgot about the Gem? Maybe she forgot about... me...? I mean, not that I think... I... I know what happened in the      Egyptian server was only to get us outta there... it didn’t mean that she... Or maybe she's mad     because I didn't go look for her after Calypso created the portal–)                                 Nova: *Giggles* I was waiting for your call!!                                                       Orion: *Chuckles* (Never mind...) Oh, really? Does that mean that...                                Nova: Yep! I have enough reasons to believe I’ve discovered the hidden whereabouts of another Gem of Doom!                                                                                              Orion: You have got to be kidding me. How sure are you?                                             Nova: I'd say... 92% sure. Maybe 93%.                                                               Orion: Holy shit! You never cease to amaze me! How did you do it?                                   Nova: Easy. At first, I was spending a lot of time hunting down clues about the remaining Gems of   Doom, but then I thought to myself... Why should I be working so hard, when it appears that someone else has already done all the work for me!                                                          Orion: Is that so?                                                                                  Nova: Yes! Check this out! Next week, there's a fancy-shmancy dinner at the Boyle Mansion, located  in the Rockefeller server. And when I say fancy-shmancy, I mean FANSHEEEE SHMANSHEEE!! Only the most important and powerful people of the world have been invited there. I’m talking... The Founder, all the largest shareholders of Ulysses, world political leaders, and most interestingly...            Orion: All those who currently possess a Gem of Doom.                                               Nova: Bingo! So, you know me... I couldn’t help myself and did a quick snoop of the Boyle Mansion   network infrastructure. Can you believe they’re still using Telnet to remotely access their         routers?! My mouth started watering as soon as I saw those plaintext credentials appear before my   eyes. To not even be using at least Secure Shell in this day and age–                               Orion: Uhh...                                                                                       Nova: Ehem. S-Sorry! Getting side-tracked here. Anyways, long story short, I was able to gain root  access to their storage server and grabbed a copy of the guest list. Everybody on there makes       sense... except for one. Cornelius Garrington. Big businessman. He's got a fortune in eternals,     amounting to around $18 billion.                                                                    Orion: Well with that much money, that could be the reason he was invited, right?                   Nova: No way! There are a lot of people richer than him, and not a single one of them was invited.  Also, he has no direct ties with Ulysses, nor does he have any personal relations with the other    guests. However... I noticed that about 5 months ago, he beefed up security in his personal vault.  That just so happens to be around the same time they announced the 4th Gem of Doom was found...     Which leads me to believe that he indeed has one of the gems, and he's hiding it inside his vault.  There's no other possible explanation.                                                              Orion: Are you suggesting we break into his vault and steal his Gem of Doom?                        Nova: Of course not. In Eternum, things don't get "stolen", Orion. They just happen to... move      around. And if his gem just happens to... move around to us... we’d end up getting an invite to the dinner instead of him! It could be a good place for us to kickstart our investigation into          Benjamin’s death. And maybe see if there’s more evidence about other mysterious deaths...           Orion: That sounds... interesting. We might even get the chance to meet the Founder himself... So,  what's the plan here, exactly?                                                                      Nova: I have no idea. I was hoping you'd be the one to take the helm from now on. We could prepare  some kind of stealth assault, or even... I don’t know, plan a heist! Whatever you want to do and    wherever you want to go, I’ll follow!                                                               Orion: A heist, huh... I think I know the perfect guy for the job. I have to make a phone call, give me a minute. I'll call you back.                                                                   Nova: Who is it? If he's in your contact list, I can bridge him onto this call.                     Orion: Wow, can you really do that? Um... Ok then, I have a friend named Chang who–                 Nova: Oh, Chang?! Pshh, too easy! I'll add him to the call. Give me a second.                       Orion: Of course you know him already...                                                            Nova: Let me just ping his nearest cell tower... alright, and now...                                Chang: Yeah Carlos, just put me down for a pepperoni pizza. But no pepperoni this time. I'm trying  to get in shape.                                                                                    Orion: Um... Chang?                                                                                 Chang: I don’t want to hear it! Don’t tell me to just order a cheese pizza instead! It tastes       totally different, alright?! Oh! By the way, since I’m being a good boy by forgoing the pepperoni,  can you put me down for a side of those cinnamon sticks? The ones shaped like SpongeBob?            Orion: W-What? What the fuck are you talking about?                                                 Chang: Carlos...?                                                                                   Nova: Oops... It looks like if the other person is already on a call, it diverts them to our call   instead.                                                                                            Chang: Claire, is that you? Why is Carlos acting so weird?                                          Orion: What the hell, why do you know all the pizza place employees by name?!                       Chang: Um... Is this still Mario's Pizza?                                                           Orion: Of course not! It's me! Orion!                                                               Chang: Orion?! When did you start working at Mario’s? Does that mean you can hook me up with a      discount?!                                                                                          Nova: No one works at Mario's! You aren’t talking to them anymore! My name is Nova. We called you   because Orion needs your help. Nice to meet you, by the way!                                        Chang: Oh! Hi guys! It’s nice to meet you, Nova. Orion has told me a lot about you.                 Nova: Oh, r-really? What did he say?                                                                Orion: T-That's not relevant! Chang, listen, I need your help. Chang, listen, we need your help.    You're obsessed with heist movies, aren't you?                                                      Chang: Heist movies? Um... Well, I wouldn't say "obsessed", but... I don't dislike them...          Orion: Y’know how you've always fantasized about planning a heist?                                  Chang: Yeah.                                                                                        Orion: And that if you ever did, it'd be the most perfect heist ever?                               Chang: I might have said that, yeah.                                                                Orion: Well, this is your chance, buddy! We need to execute a badass robbery in Eternum!            Chang: A HEIST?!                                                                                    Orion: Yes! A heist! We need to steal a Gem of Doom from someone’s vault!                           Chang: Say no more. I'M YOUR MAN!                                                                   Nova: *Chuckles* Are you sure? You don't even play Eternum! How can you mastermind this heist if you aren’t even going to be there yourself?                                                            Chang: Chang the Heist Meister doesn't need to be there. Chang the Lootin’ Tootin’ and Straight     Shootin’ only needs information and enough time to come up with the perfect plan. Tell me everything I need to know.                                                                                    Nova: Ok, um... We need to break into the personal vault of Cornelius Garrington, located within the Garrington Bank. Our objective is to retrieve an artifact called a "Gem of Doom", which is being   held there. The man is super paranoid and completely obsessed with security. He’s got cameras, armed guards, motion detectors, laser sensors... the whole nine yards! They say it's impossible to rob   him.                                                                                                Chang: What else can you tell me about him?                                                         Nova: He personally oversees all his businesses. He owns a bank, casino, two hotels, and six other  companies. All of his properties have virtual headquarters inside the Garrington District, located  on the New Vegas server. Cornelius was already rich before Eternum's launch, but now he’s managed to triple his fortune after creating the Garrington District. He has a reputation for being           meticulous, obsessive, womanizing, and... merciless. He's unmarried and has no other known          relatives, except for a son.                                                                        Chang: Could you get me a complete schematic of the bank? The casino and the hotels too. Everything. And I'd need all the info you can get me about him and his employees.                              Nova: I can do that.                                                                                Chang: Excellent. I'll start formulating a plan as soon as you send me that information. If I were  to guess, I'd say this will probably end up as a... 7-person job. Maybe 8. Do we know that many     people? I mean, people we can trust?                                                                Orion: Um... Perhaps. But we'd need Nancy and Penelope. They've never played Eternum before, but... I’ll play with them today and try to run them through the basics.                                   Chang: Nice! Count on me, man. I may not be good at a lot of things, but for the few that I am... I happen to be very good. I'll get you that Gem.                                                      Orion: Thanks, Chang. I knew you were the man we needed.                                            Chang: Anyway, I gotta go now, buddy. Today's Micaela's birthday!                                   Orion: Oh damn, it's true! Did you get her those flowers?                                           Chang: Yeah, I have a bouquet of 123 carnations sitting at home, on my dining room table. It smells like a funeral in there!                                                                            Orion: Oh damn, it's true! Did you get her that dumbbell?                                           Chang: Yeah, I’ve got all 100 lbs of it sitting at home in my room right now! Transporting it is    gonna be a pain...                                                                                  Orion: Oh damn, it's true! Did you get her those tickets?                                           Chang: Yeah, I bought us tickets for a dance performance. Though I can’t remember if it was for a   ballet or a break-dancing competition. Oh boy, I hope I dress appropriately... I just bought her    something silly. I couldn't help it. *Sighs* I hope she likes it! Between you and me, mate, I think ya boy is about to GET IT! The key is self-confidence!                                              Micaela: Chang, we're going out for lunch for my birthday. Do you wanna join us?                    Chang: Uh, Y-Y-Ye... Su-ree-okay.                                                                   Micaela: Cool! We'll be out front waiting for you!                                                  Chang: K-k-k-key...do-key... *Whispering* Oh my god! D-Did you hear that?! She invited me to lunch! Orion: *Laughs* I heard it all! Including that huge self-confidence of yours!                       Chang: It's the KEY, MAN! I'm telling you!                                                          Orion: Go get her, bro! Good luck!                                                                  Chang: Thanks!                                                                                      Nova: I'll send you all the info I get, as soon as I can! Thank you, Chang!                         Chang: You're welcome! Don't worry guys, I'll plan the most ingenious heist you've ever seen. Trust me on this. Bye!                                                                                    Nova: Alright, so... we need Penelope and Nancy, right?                                             Orion: Yeah, but no worries, I'll...                                                                Nova: We have to get things ready NOW!                                                              Penelope: Thank god you called! I'm not sure I'm understanding this correctly. You can level up in  Eternum, but... it doesn't do anything?                                                             Nova: Yup, that's correct! It's more of a reputation system than anything else. However, by         increasing your level, you can gain access to special abilities and upgraded equipment. So pretty   much, if you see a high-leveled player, they’re more than likely to be a complete badass!           Penelope: Nova? Is that you? I thought Orion called me.                                             Nova: He did! But I'm on the call too. Penelope and I know each other from college, Orion. *Giggles* I'm the one who convinced her to buy an implant! Hi Penny!                                         Penelope: Hi!                                                                                       Orion: I see someone’s doing a bit of learning before she plays!                                    Penelope: Yeah. The neural implant arrived yesterday. I tried on the E-suit too. It's a bit too     tight on my... chest, but it’s not that uncomfortable. I've been studying the major concepts too.   Restoration magic sounds interesting. What's the best element I could use, if I wanted to combine it with transmogrification glyphs?                                                                    Orion: Erm... Combine with what?                                                                    Nova: Nickel. That should be an easy answer if you’ve already played even a little bit of Eternum,  Orion. Are you sure you're the right man to guide Penny for her first time? Since she seems         interested in that sort of build, do you know of any high-skilled mages?                            Orion: That's not a bad idea, actually. I think Annie is busy today, but maybe Luna could...        Nova: Got it!                                                                                       Orion: What?                                                                                        Luna: Orion!                                                                                        Orion: Hey Luna!                                                                                    Nova: Hi Luny!                                                                                      Luna: Nova!                                                                                         Nova: Luna's a friend from Orion and Dalia's class, Penny. She and her dad make the best tacos in   the country.                                                                                        Penelope: Oh, believe me, I know! I met her when we participated in an Eternum Quiz at her cafe.    Nice to hear from you again, Luna.                                                                  Luna: Wow, there's a lot of people on here. Hello again, Penelope.                                  Nova: Today, Penny's gonna play Eternum for the first time, and we thought maybe you and Orion could lend her a hand.                                                                                   Luna: Of course. I'll be more than happy to help. I’m free pretty much all day, so I can log in     whenever you need me to.                                                                            Penelope: Thank you so much! I really appreciate this. I was interested in the magic stuff.         Luna: We can go to the academy where I learned my summoning spells, then. It's on a very small      server, but is still regarded as one of the best schools of magic within all Eternum.               Nova: That sounds perfect! Now we just need Nancy to join us, and our super-heist roster will be    complete! I'll add her to the call.                                                                 Orion: W-Wait, there’s too many people already! I can't even–                                       Nancy: Hi sweetie! I'm sorry, I just took a shower and I'm all wet. I'll put you on speaker.        Nova: Hi Miss!                                                                                      Penelope: Hi Mom!                                                                                   Luna: Hello, Ma'am. Nice to meet you.                                                               Nancy: Wow... You’ve got quite the party going on here... Am I invited?                             Nova: Absolutely! More than invited... If I may be so bold, I must say, your voice sounds so sultry and sexy! ...and I uhh, mean that with the utmost respect, Ma’am...                                 Nancy: *Giggles* Thank you! Is there anything I can help you all with?                              Nova: Oh, yeah, of course! We're trying to put together a team to... carry out a special mission on Eternum. But... it's a bit risky. C-Can we count on you?                                            Nancy: Of course! I love taking risks... But I don't know how much of a help I’ll be. I’m going to  be playing for the first time later today with Dalia.                                               Orion: I know! She told me about it! I'm gonna be joining you both! Dalia should be on her way home soon. I can give you a heads up later, before we plan on starting!                                  Nancy: That sounds wonderful. I've been looking forward to playing with you all week... Sure. The   more the merrier, I guess. I'll log in after running some errands.                                  Orion: Me too! It'll be super fun!                                                                  Nancy: Alright then! It's settled. Hmmm... Black or red?                                            Nova: Red!                                                                                          Penelope: Black!                                                                                    Luna: Black.                                                                                        Orion: Um...                                                                                        Black                                                                                               Orion: Black?                                                                                       Red                                                                                                 Orion: Red?                                                                                         Penelope: Well, I got to go, guys. I have to post something on my Instagram before I start playing. Can’t leave my followers hanging today! See you later!                                              Nova: Ohh! Are you gonna post the one at Kredon's pier? I love that pic! That whole set is just     gorgeous!                                                                                           Penelope: Yeah! I also... Wait... How... How do you know about those pics? I haven't published them anywhere.                                                                                           Nova: Um... No, I'm pretty sure you published them.                                                 Penelope: No, I'm quite certain that... Oh my god. Have you seen all the photos on my laptop?!      Nova: Um... I... M-Maybe. In the past... B-But that was the old Nova. I don't do that anymore. And  don’t sweat it! I didn't see the pics you added to your private folder either. No worries!          Penelope: What?! The pics from the other day?! You must’ve seen them, if you saw I updated that     folder!                                                                                             Nova: No, no, no worries, I haven't!                                                                Penelope: If you haven't seen them, then why do you keep saying, "no worries"??!                    Nova: Um... Oh no! B-ba...ad... sig... al. Ca...a...n't... hea... you.                              Penelope: NOVA!                                                                                     Nova: *Clears throat* Oh shoot, we lost Penny! Darn, what a shame.                                  Orion: Um...                                                                                        Luna: Yeah, I'm leaving too. I'll go see if I can still access the magic school server.             Mr. Hernandez: I'm going to work. Take care of the house, sweetheart.                               Luna: Sure, see you later.                                                                          Orion: Who's that?                                                                                  Luna: It's just my dad. He's leaving for work.                                                      Mr. Hernandez: Uhh... Who are you talking to? Is it Orion?                                          Luna: Why? Y-Yes, it's him.                                                                         Orion: Hello Mr. Hernandez! Can he hear me? Tell him I said hello!                                  Luna: He says hello.                                                                                Mr. Hernandez: Ah, I like that boy! I really think you two would make a nice couple!                Luna: *Whispering* Dad! *Whispering* You're embarrassing me!                                        Mr. Hernandez: Why? I just made an innocent comment.                                                Luna: Don’t you have to go to work, or something?!                                                  Mr. Hernandez: Ah, you're right, I gotta go. I love you, sweetie.                                   Luna: B-Bye.                                                                                        Nova: Luna? Are you there?                                                                          Luna: Y-Yeah, sorry. My dad was asking about... what ingredients we’re running low on at Loco’s.    Mr. Hernandez: Well, I gotta go. I love you, sweetie.                                               Luna: Bye. Anyway, text me when you're ready to play, Orion. Bye!                                   Nancy: Yeah, likewise, tell me when you and Dalia are ready to play. I can't wait to play together, honey... See you later, guys.                                                                       Nova: Awesome! Everything's ready! Now I'll go pull up the schematics that Chang needs! We'll talk  later! Have fun playing, Orion! Adios!                                                              Orion: (Oh my god, this headache is killing me... Alright, so I gotta help out Nancy and Penelope   during their first time in Eternum. Sounds fun! Hmm... I still have a full day ahead of me, so as   long as I don’t dillydally, I’ll probably have enough time to do everything I need to. Dalia must   still be swimming with Alex, so I should hold that one off ‘til later. School of magic it is, then!) *Typing* (I'll ask Luna for an invite to that server.) *Typing* (And one for Penny too.) *Putting  your visor on*                                                                                      Connected. Welcome back to Eternum.                                                                 Orion: (Alright, all set! Looks like they’re still getting ready. Well, I guess I better go drain   the main vein. Don't want any funny surprises after I’ve logged off... Damn, Orion! Look at you go! No more getting dizzy, huh... I think you’re finally getting the hang of this place! Making your    entrance and looking like a pro! I'm still unsure about the “hand in the pocket” pose, though. Might be a bit over the top. Maybe a more natural pose would be better... I gotta keep practicing.)      Penelope: Aaaargh... *Gagging* Oh my god... I'm so nauseous...                                      Orion: *Chuckles* Yeah, you sound just like me during my first time in Eternum!                     Penelope: Ugh... My ears are still ringing... And this water is cold as fuck... It feels...         Orion: More real than real life, huh?! (It feels good to be the veteran player, for once!)          Penelope: Yeah... You weren't lying... It's impossible to distinguish this place from the real      world. That blindfolded woman told me that– *Gagging* Told me the motion sickness would disappear   over time.                                                                                          Orion: It will, I promise! What did you talk to Idriel about?                                       Penelope: Not much. She told me the stuff about the three Weapons of Atlas, and the Gems of Doom,   but I already knew all that.                                                                        Orion: Ah, nice. I see you've done your homework. Don’t worry Penny, you'll feel better soon. It    only gets better from here on out! Come on, let me give you a hand before you get soaked!           Penelope: Tha– *Gagging* Thank you...                                                               Orion: Wow, look at that castle! That wall is huge!                                                 Penelope: Oh my god, what the hell is this?!                                                        Orion: I know right?! I can’t believe my eyes either!                                               Penelope: God, this hoodie is horrendous.                                                           Orion: Oh... you were talking about the clothes?                                                    Penelope: Is this piss-poor outfit what passes for fashion in Eternum?!                             Orion: Nah, don't worry. It's probably just the basic outfit for this server. Each server starts you off with it if you don’t have your own clothes already. You can always purchase new ones though!   Penelope: Ugh, I hope so.                                                                           Orion: The main gate seems to be right up that hill. Luna must be waiting for us somewhere nearby.  Penelope: Whoa... this mud looks so real! *Giggles* This is amazing! And I can get as dirty as I    want, because when I log off, I'll be clean as a whistle!                                           Orion: You haven't seen anything yet! Come on, we're wasting time! That's some view, isn't it?      Penelope: Yeah, it's so beautiful...                                                                Luna: Hi guys!                                                                                      Orion: *Turning around* Hmm? Luna! Whoa... you look... spectacular! (I’ve never seen her show so    much skin before. On this day, I am blessed. Hallelujah.) That outfit looks great!                  Luna: Thank you! It's just the school uniform, though. All the students wear the same outfit here.  Orion: (Oh my. The blessings continue. Thank god for uniform requirements!)                         Luna: I still had mine from when I studied here. Almost spent a full year within these walls!       Penelope: Oh my god, that outfit is gorgeous! Really accentuates your curves! What do I have to do  to get one of those?                                                                                Luna: The teachers will probably give you something to wear before entering the school grounds,     don't worry. I know we spoke on the phone earlier, but it's good to actually see you again,         Penelope!                                                                                           Penelope: Likewise! Whoa, your eyes are mesmerizing in this light! I'm sorry, but I gotta ask... Are you wearing contacts?                                                                              Luna: No, this is my natural eye color. My grandmother on my dad's side also has red eyes.          Penelope: You must be tired of hearing this, but I love them! They make you look so unique.         Luna: Thanks. If I’m being honest, it’s actually nice to hear that for once. When I was a kid, the  other children used to be scared of me just because of my eye color. So I never really...           Orion: AAAArgh!! Son of a bitch!                                                                    Professor Bundledore: WELCOME, NEW PUPILS... ...To the most prestigious school of magic, in all of  Eternum!                                                                                            Orion: You almost gave me a heart attack!                                                           Professor Bundledore: No way... Do my eyes deceive me? Or has the best summoner this school has ever seen returned for a visit?                                                                         Luna: So good to see you, Professor Bundledore. But I'm far from being the best summoner.           Professor Bundledore: No need for such modesty, Luna. During your last months here, it was you who  was showing things to me! The student definitely became the teacher! Speaking of which... my offer  for you to teach here still stands! I've hired a dozen new teachers since the last time I saw you,  and not one of them has been worth their salt.                                                      Luna: Thank you, Professor. Maybe... after I finish college.                                        Professor Bundledore: Take as much time as you need, my dear. You'll always have a seat here! Now, I see you've brought some friends!                                                                   Penelope: Hi!                                                                                       Professor Bundledore: Have you come to study in my school? Are you interested in improving your     conjuration skills? Destruction magic? Restoration abilities? Displays of illusion, perhaps?        Penelope: Um... Well, it's my first day in Eternum, actually, so...                                 Professor Bundledore: Oh! You couldn't have come to a better place then! Let me give you a proper   welcome... But first things first! Let's get rid of those Wuggle clothes, shall we? Morphulso       Itsindo!                                                                                            Orion: Huh...? Oh! Oh, shit!                                                                        Penelope: Now we're talking!                                                                        Orion: This looks great!                                                                            Penelope: I don't know who designed this outfit, but they knew exactly what they were doing!        Professor Bundledore: And behind you, my pride and joy. Welcome... To Warthogs.                     Penelope: It's sexy, feels very comfortable, and has such a stylish, matte finish!                  Orion: (Mother of god. Must keep... my eyes... above her shoulders...)                              Professor Bundledore: It also increases the magical abilities of its wearer.                        Penelope: Nice!                                                                                     Professor Bundledore: Alright, if you’ll allow me to introduce myself, young lady.                  Orion: (Damn, Luna's looking so damn hot with that uniform too.)                                    Professor Bundledore: I am Balbus Bundledore, Headmaster of Warthogs School of Witchcraft and       Wizardry.                                                                                           Orion: (I should try to focus on the situation at hand though. Come on Orion, you can do it.)       Professor Bundledore: And you all are lucky to have arrived on a very special day. Today, we        celebrate the Triwizard Tournament!                                                                 Orion: *Laughs* So the whole server is like a fan tribute to Harry Potter, eh? That's pretty cool!  Professor Bundledore: Harry what? Never heard of it. Anyway, as I was saying...                     Orion: Um...                                                                                        Professor Bundledore: We're celebrating the Triwizard Tournament. You've arrived a little late, but if you hurry, there’s still time for you all to participate! Participants are divided into groups of three and they must attempt to get four magic stamps before the clock runs out! The first team to  get four stamps and return to me will earn the Triwizard Cup, in addition to an additional special, secret prize! You can get a stamp by going to any of the teachers within the school. However, each  one of them will have a different challenge to overcome, before they give you their stamp! All      subjects have their own respective stamp. History of Magic, Charms, Potions, Herbology, Divination, Defence Against the Dark Arts...                                                                    Orion: OH COME ON! Those are all subjects from Hogwarts! Even "Warthogs" and "Bundledore" are       near-anagrams of their Harry Potter counterparts!                                                   Professor Bundledore: Hog... warts? I don't have any idea what you're talking about, boy. I do not  like hogs, nor do I like warts. The thought of the combination of the two... eugh. Disgusting!      Orion: . . .                                                                                        Professor Bundledore: *Clears throat* Now where was I? Ah, yes, you only need four stamps. You can  choose whichever subjects you prefer. Even the Emporium has one! If you need extra help, go find the Head of your House. You can visit the House of the Lion, the Snake, the Badger, or...              Orion: Those are Hogwarts' Hou–!!!                                                                  Professor Bundledore: DON'T YOU DARE MENTION THAT NAME AGAIN! THAT FUCKING BITCH STOLE MY IDEA 40   YEARS AGO AND MADE IT HER OWN! THAT’S WHAT I GET FOR TALKING ALOUD TO MYSELF IN MY WORK CUBICLE! IT WAS MY CREATION, DO YOU HEAR ME?! MINE!!!                                                           Orion: O-Ok, I'm sorry! I w-won't say it again!                                                     Professor Bundledore: How delightful. Now...                                                        Orion: (Jeez, I seem to have touched a nerve...)                                                    Professor Bundledore: Luna knows the castle well enough, but here's a map to get your bearings, in  case you need it... And that's all! I won't keep you any longer. Gather four stamps and the         Triwizard Cup will be yours! Good luck!                                                             Penelope: Wow... I gotta learn how to do that.                                                      Orion: Okay, this is pretty cool, I have to admit! And this tournament sounds like a good           opportunity for Penny and me to learn some magic. Do you have any tips, Luna?                       Luna: If you want to try to win all four stamps, I'd definitely go with Potions because I remember  it was a pretty easy subject. It’s located at the top of the East tower. Divination is another easy one, and the teacher is very nice. Its classes used to be held in that small tower right outside the main wall. Conjuration and Dark Arts were a little more challenging, but I did pretty well with    them. They take place in the main square and the chapel, respectively. And finally... the Emporium  should be easy enough. It's in a small building next to the northwest tower.                        Orion: Nice! I'm gonna write all that down. Alright, girls! What do you wanna try first?            Penelope: It's your call, boss! But make up your mind quickly! We don’t want to fall any further    behind than we already have! Man, I don’t remember the last time I felt this excited!               Orion: I like to hear that! Now let's go get that prize!                                            Penelope: Hell yes!                                                                                 Orion: Okay... We can start with...                                                                 Luna: We already have 4 stamps, don't we?                                                           Orion: Yeah! We can claim the prize already!                                                        Penelope: To be honest, this is a lot more fun than I thought it’d be, so I don’t mind further      exploring the castle.                                                                               Luna: That sounds good too. You choose, Orion.                                                      Orion: Hmmm... (That "Reminiscence" technique is incredible. We should come back some other day...  That "Reminiscence" sounded promising, but it was a total failure. Maybe we could come back some    other day and try again...) How come the Divination Tower is outside the school walls?              Luna: That actually used to be an old lookout tower. After it was decommissioned, Professor Owler   chose it as her classroom location.                                                                 Penelope: *Climbing the stairs* Ahhh... I love the ocean breeze. I'd visit this place even without  the school here. Professor Owler seems to be a smart woman! She chose the best location around!     Luna: Oh, she definitely is, even if people don't usually take her seriously. She's just a little... interesting, to say the least. You'll see.                                                         Orion: There's some kind of balcony overlooking the sea here.                                       Professor Owler: AAAAAH! You scared me!                                                             Orion: Oh... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.                                                           Professor Owler: Oh my god! My apologies, I didn't hear you coming. H-How embarrassing! Forgive me, I just like sunbathing on this balcony when the weather is nice. And I’m not a fan of tan lines,    so...                                                                                               Orion: Oh... Don't worry miss, we can’t even see you from this angle.                               Professor Owler: I'll go put some clothes on. Give me a second.                                     Orion: Sure. *Whispering* What was that about? How could she see us? Does she have x-ray vision or  something?                                                                                          Luna: It's not that. She...                                                                         Professor Owler: I'm ready! Sorry about that, guys.                                                 Orion: *Turning around* No problem. As I said we couldn't see– What the fuck...                     Professor Owler: Welcome, students! My name is Helga Owler, and this is Divination!                 Orion: Y-You... You’re invisible!                                                                   Professor Owler: Shhh! Not so loud! I'm trying to keep it a secret!                                 Orion: Um... But...                                                                                 Professor Owler: *Laughs* Hahaha! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I couldn’t help myself... I’m only kidding! Yes, I'm invisible. Have you ever seen those invisibility potions you could get on certain servers? Well, when I first discovered them, I used to abuse them... like, ALL the time! It was a blast! I   could do whatever I wanted, without any consequences! Until one day... I logged into Eternum, and   found I was somehow still invisible! And I couldn't go back to normal!                              Orion: Oh shit, really? So are you doomed to being invisible forever now?                           Professor Owler: Yes... Turns out, it’s what’s called the "Chronic Illness" of Eternum.             Orion: That must suck... I'm sorry.                                                                 Professor Owler: Well, to be honest, I kinda like it! Now I can go unnoticed whenever I want,       without spending a fortune on invisibility potions!                                                 Orion: But you're not invisible in the real world, are you?                                         Professor Owler: *Laughs* Hahaha! Don't make me laugh!                                              Orion: *Chuckles* That would be quite the superpower, you know?                                     Professor Owler: *Laughs* No, I'm not invisible in the real world. Actually, I can regain my normal appearance if I visit servers where magic is disabled.                                              Orion: Ah, that's good to hear.                                                                     Professor Owler: But magic-oriented servers happen to be my favorite. They’re the ones I visit most often... And now I can't show off my physique after I’ve been working so hard at the gym. So much   for rockin’ a beach bod...                                                                          Orion: Well hey, thanks to that dress, I can still tell you have a nice figure.                     Professor Owler: Awwww! You're so sweet! Thank you... Um...                                         Orion: Orion! And this here is Penelope, and next to her...                                         Professor Owler: Oh! I remember you! It's so good to see you, Luna!                                 Luna: Thank you, Professor!                                                                         Professor Owler: You must be here to get my stamp for the Triwizard Tournament!                     Orion: Yes!                                                                                         Professor Owler: Excellent! You're the second team to come by today!                                Orion: Really? Only the second? And here I thought we were way behind everyone else.                Professor Owler: Yeah, unfortunately, Divination has never been a popular subject... Some people say it's ineffective and unreliable... But not anymore! I am debuting a brand new technique! And I’m   looking for someone to help me out with it. What if... instead of trying to see the future... we    take a look at the past?!                                                                           Penelope: That sounds exciting!                                                                     Professor Owler: Now that's the response I was hoping for! You see... I've been working on an       artifact that will show the past of whoever stands next to it. The artifact has been imbued with a  powerful spell to enable this. I've yet to see anyone in Eternum do something remotely close to     this. So I believe I’m the first to do it! I call it... "Owler's Reminiscence".                     Orion: So... what's the challenge?                                                                  Professor Owler: Well, you’ll need to help me put this technique to the test. And if you’re willing to do that, I’ll give you my stamp.                                                                 Orion: So... You want us to be your lab rats?                                                       Professor Owler: *Laughs* Hahaha! Lab rats?! Well actually... yeah, kinda. But it's completely safe! Trust me! Worst case scenario, the artifact has no effect on you. No harm, no foul. Come with me to the basement of the tower and I'll show you! It’ll be the easiest stamp you’ll earn during the     entire tournament!                                                                                  Luna: I know Professor Owler, Orion. She can be trusted.                                            Penelope: This sounds very intriguing! I wouldn’t mind giving it a try.                             Orion: Alright, let's do it then.                                                                   Professor Owler: Great! Please, follow me... This is... the Reminiscecombobulator.                  Orion: The what?                                                                                    Professor Owler: Well, I haven’t exactly figured out a good name for it yet. But the most important thing is that it works!                                                                             Penelope: This looks awesome...                                                                     Professor Owler: Doesn't it?!                                                                       Penelope: How does it work?                                                                         Professor Owler: If all goes to plan, I should be able to show a memory from one of you... with     total fidelity! It could be of the best vacation you’ve ever taken, the moment you had your first   kiss, or even a time when you witnessed a crime taking place!                                       Penelope: Oh, that sounds lovely! Well, the first two, at least. I can see how the last example     could be really valuable though.                                                                    Professor Owler: Right?! Maybe Ulysses will hire me to work with the Praetorians! I've heard they   pay so well! Now, I only need one volunteer to begin...                                             Luna: Not me, please... I'd prefer not to... dig into the past.                                     Penelope: Me, me, me!! Please pick me!!                                                             Professor Owler: I can only pick one of you.                                                        Orion: Hmm...                                                                                       Yourself                                                                                            Orion: Since it’s only your first day in Eternum, I think I should do it, Penelope. Just to be safe. I don’t want you to get even more motion sickness, or something.                                   Penelope: Whaaat?                                                                                   Orion: You can try it on another day, once you’ve gotten more used to the game.                     Penelope: What a convenient excuse! You’re just being selfish.                                      Orion: Next time it'll be you, I promise.                                                           Penelope: Bah.                                                                                      Penelope                                                                                            Orion: *Laughs* Why are you giving me that look? Okay, okay, let's have Penny give it a whirl.      Penelope: Yay!  Thanks Orion!                                                                       Orion: So... What do we have to do?                                                                 Professor Owler: Not much. The Reminiscecombobulator and I will take care of everything, don't      worry. All you have to do is follow my instructions carefully and get rid of any distractions in    your mind. Now, Penelope, keep your eyes closed and try to recall a memory from your past. Now,     Orion, keep your eyes closed and try to recall a memory from your past. For the rest of us, we      should close our eyes as well. Think of a happy time, or one filled with sadness, or even just a    normal day. Anything will do. But whatever it is, try not to think of anything else. Orion! Close   your eyes!                                                                                          Orion: Oops, sorry.                                                                                 Professor Owler: Severum Infinecto. Let your mind go blank... You can't see anything... You can't   smell anything... You can’t hear anything... Except for a distant, yet familiar noise... And as you draw nearer to it... You start to feel...                                                           Orion: (What...) Um... Are we supposed to be seeing something or...?                                Professor Owler: . . . Y-Yes.                                                                       Orion: Why it isn't working?                                                                        Professor Owler: Hm, I’m not sure. Can anyone else see anything?                                    Penelope: Nope. Just the room we’re sitting in.                                                     Professor Owler: Dammit! It worked during all of my trials. Have you received any special training  to guard your mind against external influences, Orion?                                              Orion: Um... not that I remember.                                                                   Luna: Maybe the Reminiscecombobulator failed this time. It can happen.                              Professor Owler: I suppose... Curses! Well that just means it needs some further fine-tuning.       Orion: That’s a bummer, I really wish we could’ve assisted you more...                              Professor Owler: Yeah, I know... But still! You did your job and helped as much as you could. It's  only fair for you to get the stamp anyways. Congrats!                                               Orion: Thank you!                                                                                   Professor Owler: And good luck with the rest of the tournament! I'm gonna stay down here to         troubleshoot this piece of junk... Tell Professor Bundledore that Divination's challenge is closed  until further notice!                                                                               Orion: Thanks Professor! Ewwwww... I don't wanna eat this! I hate pineapple! It tastes like poop and it's the worst thing ever!                                                                         Dalia: How can you say that?! It tastes great!                                                      Orion: You’re only saying that because you like everything!                                         Dalia: Well duh! Anything Mommy cooks tastes awesome!                                               Orion: But this isn't cooked by her! It’s just a fruit! And all fruits taste terrible!              Dalia: Whaaat? Fruit is the best! And it helps you grow up to be strong! It’s good for you! Mommy   told me! Don't you wanna be stronger?                                                               Orion: Yeah, but...  Still, I just don't like it... Do you want it?                                 Dalia: Your pineapple?! You're giving it to me?!                                                    Orion: Yeah. You like it, don’t you?                                                                Dalia: Are you sure?! You can't take it back later!                                                 Orion: I'm sure.                                                                                    Dalia: Oh yeah! Thank you Orion! Whoa, there's still a lot left too! You don't know what you're     missing!                                                                                            Orion: If Nancy asks, I ate it all!                                                                 Dalia: Sure! More nutrients for me! Pineapple can help you see better, y’know!                      Orion: You said the same thing about lentils!                                                       Dalia: Because those ‘ave got the good stuff too! After eating all these healthy foods, I can see in the dark now!                                                                                      Orion: That's not true!                                                                             Dalia: Yes it is! If you come to my room later I'll show you! I’m practically like a cat! Right,    sis?                                                                                                Penelope: *Typing on her phone* Yeah, sure, Dalia.                                                  Dalia: See? Told ya so. If you eat all your fruits and veggies, y’get stronger and have better      eyesight. Can we watch Frozen after dinner, Penny? Pretty please?!                                  Penelope: I don't know Dalia, ask Mom. I'm leaving now. Can't be late for the big dance! Especially when you're about to be voted Dance Queen! Oh man... if they vote Diego as Dance King... *giggles*  Dalia: That means they're gonna kissy-kiss. Like, with their mouths!                                Penelope: *Giggles* I hope so! That would make everything just soooo perfect! I can see it now!     We’re gonna dance the night away until our feet won’t let us anymore. Then he’s gonna be a gentleman and offer to walk me home. We’ll share his umbrella and he’ll cuddle me tightly to keep me warm.   When we finally reach my house, I’ll say goodbye and turn for the door, but he’ll spin me around and kiss me in the rain! *Giggles* It's gonna be so romantic! Well, I gotta go. I need to stop by      Carlie's to do my hair and get dressed up. *Giggles* I have to be perfect for tonight! I'm gonna let Mom know I’m leaving. Make sure you put that bowl away once you’re done eating. Don’t break        anything!                                                                                           Dalia: Okaaay.                                                                                      Nancy: *Sighs* (I need to get this job. This is the opportunity you've been waiting for, Nancy. All you gotta do is nail this job interview. If it goes badly... I don't know what I’m going to do. This nanny gig just isn't enough to pay the bills, and between paying the girls’ tuition and the        mortgage... I’m not gonna be able to hold out much longer. They’ll take the house from me if I don’t get some sort of extra income this month. I can only fend off the bank for so long... Orion's      father is already generously paying me more than he should for taking care of his son. But even with that extra money, it’s only delaying the inevitable. If you were here, you'd know what to do, Mom. You always knew what to do. I wish I had your strength. This... this is getting too much for me to  bear alone. How on earth did you do it... What if I don't get this job either? What if I have to    take the girls out of school and transfer them? What if we don't have enough money to...)           Penelope: Mom?                                                                                      Nancy: P-Penelope!                                                                                  Penelope: Are you crying?                                                                           Nancy: *Wiping her tears* N-No! Of course not, sweetie. I think I just caught a cold or something... *Sniffles* You know... w-with this damn weather! It’s enough that it makes the day miserable... but it’s always gotta make you feel miserable too...                                                   Penelope: . . .                                                                                     Nancy: *Clears throat* But it’ll pass. Anyways, what is it, honey?                                  Penelope: Are you sure you're okay?                                                                 Nancy: Of course, don't worry. Did you want to ask me something?                                    Penelope: Not really! I just wanted to tell you I was leaving! I'm going to Carlie's!               Nancy: Oh... Ok, but don’t be out for too long, alright?                                            Penelope: *Standing up* Another friend lent me a dress for tonight, and Carlie's mom said she was   gonna do my hair!                                                                                   Nancy: For tonight? What’s happening tonight?                                                       Penelope: Kredon's Spring Dance! It's tonight, remember?!                                           Nancy: W-What?! Since when?                                                                         Penelope: They set the date months ago, Mom...                                                      Nancy: Oh honey... I... I must’ve forgotten all about it. Sweetie, umm... I’m so sorry but, I don’t think you can go tonight. I need you to stay and take care of Dalia and Orion.                      Penelope: What...? WHAT?! You're kidding, right?                                                    Nancy: I’m sorry, hun. I have an important job interview tomorrow, remember? The position is here in Kredon, but the interview is being held out of town at their headquarters. I have to take a train  in 40 minutes if I want to be there tomorrow morning.                                               Penelope: No! No, no, no! You can't do this to me! You know how important Kredon's Spring Dance is! Nancy: I... I know honey, but I don't have anyone else I can call on such short notice to take care of Dalia and Orion. And they're too young to be left alone. I'm so sorry, I really am, but I’m      afraid you have to stay home.                                                                       Penelope: You can't take this away from me! You went when you were my age! Everyone goes to their   Spring Dance! If I miss it, I’m just gonna end up as a nobody!                                      Nancy: Come on sweetie, don't say that! You're so pretty and you’ve got a good head on your         shoulders! Your grades are great too... you’re gonna be super popular regardless!                   Penelope: Good grades don’t mean shit for popularity! Wake up, Mom! I'm just gonna be known as the  fucking LOSER who missed Kredon's Spring Dance!                                                     Nancy: Penelope! Watch your mouth!                                                                  Penelope: I don’t give a shit anymore! I'm going to this dance, whether you like it or not!         Nancy: I SAID YOU'RE NOT GOING! End of discussion!                                                  Penelope: This is the biggest night of my life! You can't do this to me!                            Nancy: ENOUGH! IT'S JUST A DANCE, PENELOPE! There'll be more! Do you have any idea how much I've    sacrificed so that you and Dalia would never be left wanting?! I’m not asking you to stay so I could hit the bar with my friends and get drunk all night! This is for a job! A job that could save our  family! You need to start acting your age and stop behaving like such a child. Think about someone  other than yourself for once!                                                                       Penelope: . . .                                                                                     Nancy: . . .                                                                                        Penelope: *Starts sobbing*                                                                          Nancy: . . .                                                                                        Penelope: M-Mom?                                                                                    Nancy: I'm sorry, honey. I didn't mean to shout at you. It's just that... Mommy's been very stressed lately. Can you forgive me?                                                                        Penelope: Of c-course...                                                                            Nancy: I love you, Penelope. I really do. And I only want the best for you. Just... don't grow up   too fast, please.                                                                                   Penelope: Okay...                                                                                   Nancy: *Sighs* Go on then. You have a dance to get ready for, right?                                Penelope: Really?! So I can go?!                                                                    Nancy: Of course you can! I fondly remember my Spring Dance. And I want you to make your own nice   memories too.                                                                                       Penelope: Thank you so much, Mom! And... what about Dalia and Orion?                                Nancy: I'll stay and take care of them, don't worry. Maybe this is a sign the job wasn’t the one for me. I’m sure I’ll find an even better one soon!                                                    Penelope: I'm sure of it! You're like the smartest woman I know!                                    Nancy: *Chuckles* Thank you, sweetheart. Now go to your friend's house, and have fun! But don't stay out too late! And be careful with the boys! At your age, all the hormones start to make them       crazy!                                                                                              Penelope: M-Mooooom!                                                                                Nancy: Don't let him do anything you aren’t comfortable with!                                       Penelope: I d-don't know what you’re talking about!                                                 Nancy: *Chuckles* Thank goodness! I'm not sure I'm ready for you to start adolescence yet. So just  be careful and have a wonderful night, alright? I love you, Penelope.                               Penelope: I love you too, Mom!                                                                      Nancy: Come on now, get going! The star of the Dance shouldn’t be late!                             Penelope: Yes! *Typing on her phone*                                                                Where are you, girl? You should’ve been here by now!                                                Penelope: I'm on my way! I was talking with my mom.                                                 Whatever, just hurry up! Babe, I caught a glimpse of Diego trying his suit on earlier. He looks     sooooo HOT!                                                                                         Penelope: Haha I bet.                                                                               Nancy: *Clears throat* Hello, this is Nancy Carter. Yes, this... this is in regard to my job        interview scheduled for tomorrow morning. . . . That’s correct, for the position of Stem Cell       Research Scientist. With Doctor Strayley, yes. Um... I'm afraid I must cancel the interview. I      couldn't find anyone to watch my daughter tonight, so... The next train doesn't leave until tomorrow at 6, so I wouldn’t be able to arrive on time. . . . N-No, I don't have a car right now... But     perhaps we could reschedule the meeting for... . . . Y-Yes, of course... I understand... W-Well     thank you anyway. I really appreciate you guys providing me the opportunity in the first place...   Dalia: And then there's Olaf! He was just a normal snowman, but one day Elsa gave him life with her magic and now he can talk! He's super fun!                                                          Orion: Mm-hm...                                                                                     Dalia: Huh? What’s wrong?                                                                           Orion: Nothing... I’m just sad because in a couple of weeks, my Dad will be bringing me with him to Europe.                                                                                             Dalia: Really? For how long?                                                                        Orion: He doesn't know.                                                                             Dalia: Well you can still come play with me after school, right? I mean, how far is Europe?         Orion: I don’t know. I think it’s pretty far...                                                     Dalia: Huh. Well, if you can't visit me anymore, then I'm going to visit you!                       Orion: In Europe?                                                                                   Dalia: Anywhere! I'm gonna be an explorer!                                                          Orion: An explorer?                                                                                 Dalia: Yeah! Let me show you my special explorer glasses! I know they’re somewhere in here... AHA!  Orion: *Laughs* What are those!                                                                     Dalia: My explorer glasses! I just told you! Now I’m DALIA THE EXPLORER!!                           Orion: Whatcha gonna explore?!                                                                      Dalia: The whole world! No, no... THE WHOLE UNIVERSE! Me and my trusty magic sword will explore     hundreds of worlds and discover new planets!                                                        Orion: Cool! Is that a magical sword?!                                                              Dalia: It is! I must defend myself from the evil monsters of space!                                 Orion: Space has monsters?!!                                                                        Dalia: A ton! They're ugly and scary! They even have big horns and sharp claws! But I'm not afraid  of them! Because I'm DALIA THE EXPLORER!                                                            Penelope: *Laughs* Okay, okay... Has Dalia the Explorer finished her dinner?                        Dalia: Of course! I have to eat to be stronger, to fight against the monsters!                      Penelope: *Chuckles* Ah, yeah, I forgot you eat like an adult already. I wish I liked healthy foods as much as you!                                                                                     Dalia: Well Mommy says you need to eat vegetables to grow up big and strong!                        Penelope: That's right! So you're gonna be an explorer, huh?                                        Dalia: The best explorer in the galaxy!                                                             Penelope: Wow! Can we come along too? We’re gonna need your protection though if those pesky        monsters try to attack us!                                                                          Dalia: Absolutely! Don't worry sis, I'll protect you, Orion, and Mom! You have nothing to fear! I'll defeat them all with my magic sword!                                                               Penelope: Whoa, you have a magic sword?!                                                            Dalia: Yes!                                                                                         Penelope: That is so awesome! Does it have a name?                                                  Dalia: Stormblade! The destroyer of monsters!                                                       Penelope: Wow, that's a catchy name! I like it! You know... since Dalia the Explorer has been so    well behaved, I think we're gonna watch Frozen tonight! And if you aren’t too sleepy afterward,     maybe we can read a few bedtime stories together. How does that sound?                              Dalia: Yay!!! Frozen! Can you read me the story about the Princess Warrior?                         Penelope: Of course, young lady! I love that one too.                                               Dalia: But... I thought you were leaving?                                                           Penelope: Nah, there was a... change of plans. Mom has to leave for some important stuff, but I'm   gonna stay here to play with you instead!                                                           Dalia: Hooray!                                                                                      Penelope: But only if you two keep up the good behavior, alright?? Or else I’m gonna end up watching Frozen all by myself! Has Orion finished his dinner?                                               Orion: I did! I ate a pineapple THIS BIG!                                                           Penelope: Wow, that's a big ‘ol pineapple!                                                          Orion: Yeah! It was huge! And I ate every bit of it! Tell her how huge-mongous it was, Dalia!       Dalia: Oh yes, it was very big! The most huge-mongous one I've ever seen! Orion ate it all in one   sitting!                                                                                            Orion: That’s right! I gobbled it up so fast!                                                       Penelope: *Chuckles* Well, since you liked it so much, I'll give you some more for your movie snack!Orion: Um... O-Ok! I might be too full though, y’know... Do ya think we could watch The Incredibles too?                                                                                                Penelope: Mmmm... okay, but only if you clean up this room first! There are toys everywhere! This   place needs to be spotless!                                                                         Orion: Yay!                                                                                         Dalia: Quickly, quickly! Pick up everything, Orion! What about Finding Nemo?!                       Penelope: Three movies?! You're pushing your luck here, Miss!                                       Dalia: Pretty pleaaaaaseee!                                                                         Penelope: Mmm... we'll see!                                                                         Dalia: Yay!!! Finding Nemo!                                                                         Nancy: . . .                                                                                        Penelope: But you got to bathe first!                                                               Dalia: Aww! Well okay, I’ll do it for Dory!!                                                        Penelope: Come on Orion, let's go to the bathroom.                                                  Orion: Me too?!                                                                                     Penelope: Yeah, let's go! We're all gonna bathe together!                                           Orion: But I'm not dirty!                                                                           Penelope: I can see the mud stains from here, mister! W-What? What happened? Where’d it go?!        *Opening her eyes* I wanted to see more!                                                            Professor Owler: T-The Reminiscecombobulator has limits! I still have to fine-tune it! And w-well,  you all were about to take a bath. I'm not sure how old you were in that memory, but...             Penelope: Huh?? Hmm? Oh y-yeah, of course. I forgot you guys were seeing that memory too. T-Thank   god we stopped there. But that was incredible!                                                      Orion: It really was...                                                                             Luna: It felt like I was there! This technique is unbelievable, Professor!                          Professor Owler: Thank you!                                                                         Orion: That’s crazy because I don’t remember that day at all. What made you choose that moment?     Penelope: I don't know. It just... came to my mind. It was a fun day. And... well, Mom got the job, we were able to keep the house, and our lives got a lot better after that. I like to think I made   the right decision.                                                                                 Orion: But what about the dance? You missed it!                                                     Penelope: Meh, it doesn't matter. From that day on, I stopped caring so much about being "popular"  and started focusing more on having quality friendships instead. So... I guess that part turned out good also.                                                                                          Orion: Still, I feel like I owe you a party now.                                                    Penelope: Mmmm... Well you know, there's a costume party on campus in a couple of weeks. I wasn't   planning on going, but... maybe if you tagged along with me, I'd change my mind.                    Orion: Oh damn! That sounds awesome! Of course I'll go with you! I'm gonna make sure it's the most  fun you’ve ever had at a party!                                                                     Penelope: *Giggles* That's a bold move! But alright, now I’m actually looking forward to it. I'll   start thinking about what I could wear... Oh! I should ask Nova to come along too. Even though it’s a college party, you’re more than welcome to join too, Luna!                                        Luna: Thank you, Penelope! I'd rather stay home, though. I'm not particularly fond of parties. I... don't usually enjoy being around a lot of people. But thank you.                                    Penelope: Anytime! Let me know if you change your mind! Seriously, don't worry about it.            Professor Owler: Okay guys, thank you so much for helping me with my device! Penelope showed an     astonishing ability to maintain concentration! You have earned my stamp! Congrats!                  Orion: Thank you!                                                                                   Professor Owler: And good luck during the rest of the tournament! Be sure to come back and visit me another day!                                                                                        Orion: We will! Thanks Professor!                                                                   Chop-Chop: Ooooooh! Welcome, welcome! I knew you come back for Igor! Come here, Iggy, Iggy! Client  want to buy you!                                                                                    Igor: Someone’s cock wants that round trip ticket down Tentacle Town!                               Orion: N-No! We came back to talk to Wenlin.                                                        Wenlin: Me? You're gonna make me blush!                                                             Orion: Well, the thing is... I talked to Professor Mandrake. She told me you owe her 200 eternals,  and she asked me to collect them for her. She promised that she'd give us her stamp if we did her   this favor.                                                                                         Wenlin: Oh... That's disappointing... but it's true. *Giggles* I was hoping she'd forget about it.  Okay, take the money. Tell her this makes us even.                                                  Orion: Thanks!                                                                                      Wenlin: Be smart with your own money, though! Gotta have enough cash when the Polyjuice potion is   ready!                                                                                              Chop-Chop: Good advice! You need best money for best items in Chop-Chop's! No waste in other shops! Only junk there!                                                                                    Orion: *Chuckles* I'll try to keep that in mind. Okay, we gotta go now. See you later!              Wenlin: BYE BYE!                                                                                    Chop-Chop: MISS YOU EVEN MORE NOW!                                                                  Orion: We already have Chop-Chop's stamp. If we go back in, he's probably gonna have another        10-minute presentation for his other weird items.                                                   Penelope: *Laughs* We should save that for the next day. Are we going the right way?                Luna: Yes. Warthogs can be a bit of a labyrinth at first, but once you get used to it, navigating   becomes a breeze. The Emporium is located right over there, past the lion and up the stairs.        Orion: Hello!                                                                                       ???: Coming!                                                                                        Orion: So do you know the owner of this place?                                                      Luna: Not really. An older woman used to run the place, but she retired right before I was getting  ready to leave Warthogs. A man came to replace her, but I didn’t get to know him well. Most of the  time, the Emporium was closed because the new owner had to attend to other shops in different       servers. At least, so I’ve heard.                                                                   Orion: Uh... other shops...? H-How exactly would you describe this man...?                          Luna: Well... as I said, I only met him a couple of times. All I remember is that he was a bit...   eccentric.                                                                                          Orion: Eccentric, huh...?                                                                           Penelope: What sort of things can people purchase here?                                             Luna: A little bit of everything. Cloaks, robes, hats, protective gloves, spell books, cauldrons,   crystal vials... anything you might need to study here.                                             Orion: (Please don't be Chop-Chop, please don't be Chop-Chop, please don't be Chop-Chop, please do–)Chop-Chop: OOOOHHHHHHHHHHH!!                                                                        Orion: . . . (This has to be some kind of curse.)                                                   Chop-Chop: WELL HELLOOOO!!! Welcome back, best friend Orion, to Chop-Chop's!! Best shop in ALL      WARTHOGS! No, no, IN ALL ETERNUM!                                                                   Orion: Oh come on, this can no longer be just a coincidence! You're following me!                   Chop-Chop: No no no, friend! I only follow trail of money! If Eternals you bring, Chop-Chop can     smell the CHA-CHING!!!                                                                              Luna: Do you two know each other?                                                                   Orion: Um... yeah. I keep running into him everywhere I go! Or that's what I thought. Now I'm pretty convinced he follows me around because I'm the only one dumb enough to buy his junk.               Chop-Chop: Junk? Oh Orion, why you try to hurt my achey-breaky heart? You know Chop-Chop only have  best materials! Best products! Didn't lady like animal?                                             Luna: Oh, Chop-Chop sold you Maurice? Yeah, he's great!                                             Chop-Chop: Ahh! See?! Hear that, Orion? He great! Like everything I sell!                           Wenlin: Ohhh! Customers! Yay!

Like in the storybooks! I'm Penelope, nice to meet you! You're so     cute!                                                                                               Wenlin: Aww, thank you sweetie! Wow, are these puppies real?!                                       Penelope: H-Hey!                                                                                    Wenlin: Now this is what I call cleavage! They're huge! And super soft! Can I live here?            Penelope: Agh, no! Get off!

Wenlin: We have everything!                                                                         Chop-Chop: Only best materials!                                                                     Wenlin: Best products!                                                                              Chop-Chop: And best price!                                                                          Orion: *Laughs* You've taught her well, I see.                                                      Wenlin: Chop-Chop is helping me become a master businesswoman!

Wenlin: I happen to be a good sorceress and a skilled alchemist, so I know our products well. And   Chop-Chop knows how to sell them!                                                                   Orion: *Chuckles* You two seem like a good team. Unfortunately, I'm not here to buy anything today. We just came to get a stamp.

Orion: Uh... no, not like a stamp for a letter. We need the stamp for the Triwizard Tournament.     Chop-Chop: Huh?

You're just taking advantage of the school event to make more money for yourself?      Really, Chop-Chop...? Scamming an educational institution?!                                         Chop-Chop: Ohhhhohoho, no, no, no! Chop-Chop no scam! Scam not even in my vocabulary! That word even burn tongue when leave my mouth! Eugh! Only fair challenge! No scam!

Orion: Sex items?                                                                                   Wenlin: Of course! Violence sells. Sex sells!

Wenlin: Our top items, just for you!                                                                Orion: Ah shit, here we go again... *Sighs* Well alright. It’s an easy stamp, I guess... Show me    what you got.                                                                                       Wenlin: We’ll start off with a bang!

Penelope: No! I don't want that one either!                                                         Wenlin: Ohhh, my mistake! Team Vampires then!

Or maybe wife give bad sucky-sucky? Igor is new best friend!               Igor: Mmmm, Igor is hungry for the only thing on the menu – one nice, biiiiig cock!                 Chop-Chop: Oh he hungry all right!                                                                  Igor: How about I treat that lovely man meat of yours to these lusciously juicy lips?!              Orion: *Shivers* No thanks, I'm good.                                                               Igor: What about you, doll face?                                                                    Luna: Um... No, thanks Igor.                                                                        Igor: Don't be shy, I’ve got a ticket for your veiny dick... And it’s for a round trip... All the   way down my tentacle throat!                                                                        Luna: Erm... No, thank you. I don't have a... that.                                                 Igor: What! You ain’t tuckin’ a cock down there? That's weird. What's up with this trend among women lately in not having penises? Igor thinks everyone should be packin’!                              Chop-Chop: Yeah, Igor funny and good friend! Would make terrible broth though, no recommend!        Wenlin: Wanting to spice up your time in the bedroom? Well I’ve got Bertie Bott's Random Flavor     Condoms for you! Cherry, Honey, Chocolate, Chili Powder, or Ogre Cum! You never know what you’re    gonna get! The uncertainty makes it so exciting!                                                    Chop-Chop: Having fun with married lady? Husband enter room with big shotgun and then point at your head? Just use my Magic Portkey! Teleport to safe place for quick escape! Just like that! UH        OH–POOOOOOOOOF!                                                                                     Orion: W-What? Where did they go?                                                                   Chop-Chop: Um... not sure. I think storage room. But worry not! I'm going to unlock door now! Just  wait here, I be back in no time.                                                                    Orion: Goddammit, Chop-Chop...                                                                      Wenlin: While waiting, I'll show Orion our most exclusive merchandise!                              Chop-Chop: Ah yes, good idea! Orion deserve best product! I go save your ladies from locked room! Be right back!                                                                                        Orion: Ok, hurry up!                                                                                Wenlin: *Flying to the basement* Follow me to the distillery!                                       Orion: What the hell...                                                                             Wenlin: I know we have one last sample around here somewhere... Ahhh, bingo! Here it is! Looks like there’s only one drop left, but it should be enough.                                                Orion: What happened? You're big! Like, human-sized!                                                Wenlin: Huh? Of course I'm human-sized. You didn't think I was a real fairy, did you? I was just    using a reducing spell.                                                                             Orion: Oh yeah... of course I know... It's just that... well, sometimes I get so immersed that I    forget... *Clears throat* Anyway, what did you want to show me?                                     Wenlin: Oh, yeah... This potion is a bit... controversial. You have to promise me that this         information won’t leave the room.                                                                   Orion: Of course, I promise.                                                                        Wenlin: Have you ever heard of the Polyjuice Potion?                                                Orion: I've heard the name.                                                                         Wenlin: It allows whoever drinks it to assume the form of someone else. At first it was legal and,  of course, mainly used for sexual matters. But after a series of scandals and security breaches with some senior Ulysses officials, it was outlawed by Eternum's General Code of Ethics.                Orion: Oh shit... Does this mean that, if you're caught with the stuff, the Praetorians can         excommunicate you?                                                                                  Wenlin: That's right. This, combined with the fact that it's a very complex and time-consuming      concoction, makes it an extremely rare and sought-after potion. Have you met Professor Mandrake?    Orion: Yes, I have! Actually, now that you mention it, she told me you owe her 200 eternals. I was  supposed to collect them for her.                                                                   Wenlin: *Giggles* I was hoping she'd forget about it. Okay, take the money. Tell her this makes us  even.                                                                                               Orion: Was the money related to this potion?                                                        Wenlin: Yes. The Polyjuice Potion requires some ingredients that are a little more sketchy to       obtain. Luckily, Professor Mandrake knows how to get them.                                          Orion: I haven't. Is she part of the faculty here?                                                  Wenlin: Yeah. She teaches Potions, in the East Tower of the castle. Because of that, she knows how  to get the ingredients required to create the Polyjuice Potion. Some happen to be a little more     sketchy to obtain. She was able to get me the liver of a Striga. Now, all I need are a couple other ingredients and then I'll be able to prepare an entire new batch of Polyjuice Potion. Do you want me to save a bottle for you? With how hard this potion is to come by, they’ll sell out in less than a day!                                                                                                Orion: Yeah, save a bottle for me! That sounds like it could be very useful.                        Wenlin: Oh, it is. You can use it to just play around and have some fun, or maybe even attempt      something bigger... it's totally up to you! Do you want me to show you how it works? There's only   one sip left from the last batch, but it should be enough. It’ll cost you 60 eternals though.       Trust her                                                                                           Orion: Nah, there's no need. I trust you.                                                           Wenlin: Excellent! Well, consider your order placed! Another successful transaction conducted by    Wenlin! The potion will be ready the next time we see each other! *Giggles* Chop-Chop will be so    proud of me!                                                                                        Orion: Pleasure doing business with you!                                                            Wenlin: Let's head back upstairs. Chop-Chop and your girls have probably returned by now.           Try it (-60 eternals)                                                                               Orion: Seems fair. So how do you select a person to morph into?                                     Wenlin: You’re gonna need a single strand of their hair. When they weren’t looking, I took a strand from both of your friends earlier. So now we can use these and you can judge for yourself if the    potion works or not.                                                                                Orion: You mean to say, you can turn into Penelope or Luna by drinking that thing now?              Wenlin: An exact copy. So... who are you going with?                                                Luna                                                                                                Orion: Let's go with Luna.                                                                          Penelope                                                                                            Orion: Let's go with Penny.                                                                         Wenlin: Alright... *Drinks from the bottle*                                                         Orion: Holy shit!                                                                                   Wenlin: Wait, wait! Don't look yet! Let me grab a school uniform and fix my makeup first! I gotta   give you the full effect!                                                                           Orion: (This potion can prove to be tremendously useful. We could take the form of the Ulysses big  shots to get insider information, or even Gems of Doom! Although... if a sip alone costs 60         eternals, I don't know how much a full bottle will be. I better start saving up some money.)        Wenlin: Ready!                                                                                      Orion: *Turning around* Oh my god...                                                                Wenlin: What? Don't I look like her? Dammit, I thought I got the proportions of the ingredients     right.                                                                                              Orion: No, no, you look exactly like her! It's just that... I wasn't expecting you to be            half-dressed...                                                                                     Wenlin: Oh... *giggles* yeah, I couldn’t find the rest of the uniform... only the underwear.        Orion: I can see that...                                                                            Wenlin: I think it’s close enough, though, so... Does it do the trick? Would you think I'm Luna?    Does it do the trick? Would you think I'm Penelope?                                                 Orion: Definitely...                                                                                Wenlin: *Giggles* Boy, I love this girl's body! Look at this butt! Perfectly shaped, just like a    heart!                                                                                              Orion: Yeah, I can see that...                                                                      Wenlin: Her boobs are magnificent, but then she’s got this butt too! It's also perfect! What a total bombshell!                                                                                         Orion: (Holy shit, I know it's not her exactly, but... it's definitely still her body. Damn, what a beautiful sight...)                                                                                 Wenlin: *Removing the underwear* I love her skin too. So pale and smooth... *Removing the underwear* Fuuuuuu...!! I wish I had these tits! *Giggles* Imagine sliding in between these things and having them wrapped around you? It’d probably feel almost like real penetration!                           Orion: W-What are you doing?!                                                                       Wenlin: Making sure the potion got everything correct, of course. Down to the most intimate         details... Come on, you must have seen your girlfriend naked hundreds of times. Don't act so        surprised!                                                                                          Orion: She's... she's not my girlfriend. (I wish.) We're just friends. I've never seen her naked.   We're just friends. I've only seen her half-naked once... during a photoshoot. We're just friends.  Wenlin: Oh... Really? In that case, I should have charged you way more! I guess I misread the looks she gave you...                                                                                     Orion: What looks?                                                                                  Wenlin: Anyway, do you wanna see more...? You must be very curious... *Giggles* I guess I misread   the looks she gave you...                                                                           Orion: What looks?                                                                                  Wenlin: So tell me... don't you wanna see a bit more? If I had a "friend" who looked like this, I’d be dying to find out what’s underneath all those clothes...                                         Orion: Well... I'd be lying if I said I wasn’t a little curious... But this is probably wrong and I shouldn– Shouldn... Oh my god... She's an angel... She's perfect...                                 Wenlin: Well? Are you sold on the potion yet, Orion?                                                Orion: Take my money...                                                                             Wenlin: I assumed as much, seeing the bulge in your pants... That was fast...                       Orion: Um... yeah, well, I couldn't help it.                                                        Wenlin: Do you wanna feel these tits?                                                               Orion: *Gulp* Can I?                                                                                Wenlin: I’ll let you have a little groping fun, for only 60 eternals more. Or if you prefer, you can feel this sweet, heart-shaped ass right here... Or if you prefer, you can feel this huge, gorgeous ass right here... All you gotta do is hand over the 60... Awww... Dammit. Guess there wasn’t as much potion left as I thought. I'm sorry, that was the last drop of it! Come back in a couple of weeks  and I'll have more!                                                                                 Orion: Awww...                                                                                      Wenlin: Maybe next time, we'll have a few more minutes to... fully test our products. I really      enjoyed having this girl's body, even if it only lasted for a short time.                           Orion: Well I gotta say, you have a great body too.                                                 Wenlin: Aw, thank you, Orion! When you return, perhaps I'll show this reduction spell to one of your friends...                                                                                         Orion: Can you decide whether to be big or small, at will?                                          Wenlin: It’ll take some time to perfect, but yeah. I can even adjust my size in certain areas for   some... extra tightness, if you know what I mean... Anyway, let's go back upstairs! Chop-Chop and   your girls have probably returned by now!                                                           Orion: S-Sure! (Holy shit, maybe I’ll be the one hunting down Chop-Chop next time!) H-Hey there! Hey there! Where’d you guys end up?                                                                    Luna: Chop-Chop's storage room. There’s a lot of weird looking stuff in there! We made sure to keep our hands to ourselves, just to be safe.                                                            Orion: *Laughs* That was probably the smartest idea.                                                Chop-Chop: Okay friend, what you buying this time?                                                  Wenlin: Actually, he reserved a bottle of... *whispers* Polyjuice Potion. He'll buy it the next time we see each other.                                                                                 Chop-Chop: Ohhhh! Excellent, excellent! That potion expensive! I need to start calling Orion, Mr.   Money Bag! You did good Wenlin, I very proud of you! Well, don't forget about purchase! That money  will burn hole in pocket until you give to me!                                                      Orion: So since I’ll be buying something... do we get the stamp?                                    Chop-Chop: Stamp? I thought you no want to mail–                                                    Orion: For the Triwizard Tournament!!                                                               Chop-Chop: Ahhhh! Yes, yes! Congratulation! Stamp for my best customer! Please come back soon to    Chop-Chop's!

Orion: *Laughs* (They're quite a pair.) Okay, time to climb this damn tower again.                  Warthogs Student: Huh, are you going to Potions? If I were you, I wouldn't even bo–                 Orion: Fuck off, dude! You already screwed us!                                                      Warthogs Student: Oh! You guys are back! I didn’t recognize you at first... Sorry guys, she offered me money. I gotta make that bread, y’know.                                                          Luna: I understand, don’t worry!                                                                    Orion: You're too nice, Luna...                                                                     Professor Mandrake: Ah, finally! Do you have my money?                                              Orion: Yes!                                                                                         Professor Mandrake: Gimme, gimme!                                                                   Orion: Give us the stamp for the tournament first!                                                  Professor Mandrake: *Gasps* Do you really think I'm not a woman of my word?                         Orion: You're clearly not! You said it yourself!                                                    Professor Mandrake: Hmm... That's a fair point. Alright, here you go. Now the money!                Orion: Here. Pleasure doing business with you.                                                      Professor Mandrake: Excellent! I love when a man will do whatever it takes to win.                  Orion: Sure, sure... Anyway, we're leaving now. Thank you, Professor.                               Professor Mandrake: Are you sure you don't want to drink my potion again?                           Penelope: Y-Yeah, I'm pretty sure.                                                                  Professor Mandrake: What about you, Luna?                                                           Luna: No thanks!                                                                                    Professor Mandrake: That's too bad... Alright, take care and remember to have fun!                  Orion: (There's no way I'm climbing those 14 floors again without good reason.)                     Luna: This is the Potions Tower. I was never very interested in Potions, but it’s always had a      reputation for being an easy subject.                                                               Orion: I guess, in a world where people can summon magical creatures by just uttering a couple of   words, this does seem a little dull.                                                                Luna: Professor Mandrake teaches her class on the top floor of the tower. Unfortunately for us,     there happens to be fourteen floors.                                                                Orion: Jesus, I hope you two are ready to feel the burn! Would you think less of me if I wanted to  stretch beforehand, or...                                                                           Warthogs Student: AAAAAAHH!                                                                         Warthogs Student: Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!                                                  Warthogs Student: Dubs tee eff! You look just like @Miss_penny!                                     Warthogs Student: Because she totes is! Oh my god, please, tell me it's really you!                 Penelope: Um, yeah, it’s me alright!                                                                Warthogs Student: AYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!                                                            Warthogs Student: I told you the pics weren't photoshopped!                                         Warthogs Student: She looks exactly like her Instagram photos!                                      Warthogs Student: I didn't know you were on the Eternzz! That is like, so rad!                      Penelope: Y-Yeah, I just started today, actually.                                                   Warthogs Student: Oh my god, I can't believe I’m standing in your presence! Oh my god, somebody     pinch me!                                                                                           Warthogs Student: *Takes a big whiff* You smell exactly like I thought you would!                   Warthogs Student: Can you return the follow on Insta? My @ is EmmilyGrivas!                         Penelope: Sure! I'll try to remember.                                                               Warthogs Student: Ohmygodohmygodohmygod, THANK YOU!                                                 Warthogs Student: Oh em gee, you are like, super super nice. I just want to double tap heart you in real life!                                                                                          Warthogs Student: If only I had my camera on me right now! Josh is never gonna believe I actually   met you!                                                                                            Penelope: I gotta go now girls, but it was really nice meeting you both!                            Warthogs Student: I’m for realz gonna tweet everyone now to tell them you're playing Eternzz!       Warthogs Student: Thank you for talking to us!                                                      Orion: . . .                                                                                        Warthogs Student: I  LOVE  YOU ! ! !                                                                Orion: Sometimes I forget I'm friends with a celebrity.                                             Penelope: Yeah, you don't know just how lucky you are. *Giggles* You even sleep under the same roof as me! We've been hanging out for a while now, and you still haven't asked me for a single          autograph! Or to take a selfie together! That makes me very uncomfortable, to be honest. I’m gonna  need a little more fanfare from you, Orion.                                                         Orion: *Laughs* I'm sorry. I'll start addressing you as my "Queen" from now on.                     Penelope: *Laughs* No, but seriously, that's one of the things I like about you. You just treat me  like a human being. Because, at the end of the day, that's exactly what I am. Just a normal girl who has her ups and downs like everybody else.                                                         Yeah, you're not special                                                                            Orion: Exactly, I’m glad you don’t let it get to your head. When someone thinks they're better than others, things start to go sour.                                                                    Penelope: That's what I'm saying.                                                                   You stand out                                                                                       Orion: Well, you can’t really deny it, can you? You’ve got it all. You're pretty, clever, and have a breathtaking body... so of course it's natural to stand out from the rest.                         Penelope: Yeah well... thanks, but I still prefer not to receive any special treatment.             You're special to me                                                                                Orion: Honestly Penny, you really are special to me, but not because you're famous on Instagram. I  couldn't care less about your social network pages or how many followers you have... I only care    about the person behind it. You became a special person to me just because of who you are.          Penelope: Thank you, Orion.                                                                         Orion: Will do. Do you receive a lot of harassment on social media?                                 Penelope: Well, it didn't use to be a big deal, but as my number of followers has grown, so has the number of troublemakers. Sometimes I receive a lot of unwanted sexual advances, or messages begging me to start an OnlyFans account. You wouldn't believe how much money I've been offered, just for a  single nude picture.                                                                                Orion: I guess only a truly blessed man will be able to see that during this life...                Penelope: I guess so...                                                                             Orion: I can imagine. Well come on then, “normal girl”! Let's climb those 14 floors! No special     queen carriage for you!                                                                             Penelope: *Laughs* Let's train these glutes!                                                        Warthogs Student: Huh, are you going to Potions?                                                    Orion: Yes, sir.                                                                                    Warthogs Student: Bah, if I were you, I wouldn't even bother. She has the most stupid challenge in  all of Warthogs. It's literally impossible to complete. And it goes by fast! You’ll be huffin’ and  puffin’ on these stairs again before you know it! These steps might not look that bad, but believe  me, they're exhausting! Especially if you're short-legged like myself.                              Orion: Well, we're already here, so we'll take our chances.                                         Warthogs Student: As you wish. Here’s a freebie tip for you then – it has Syrup of Arnica. That's   the only ingredient I got right.                                                                    Orion: Hmm... I'll remember that.                                                                   Warthogs Student: Good luck.                                                                        Orion: Thank you! *Panting* F-Finally. That guy wasn’t lying... those steps really do take a toll on you...                                                                                             Professor Mandrake: Welcome to Potions!                                                             Orion: T-Thanks!                                                                                    Professor Mandrake: My name is Dona Mandrake, Master of Potions and Head of the Snake House. We’re  known as the home for the most evil and malicious Warthogs students!                                Orion: Nice to meet you. I’m Orion, and this is Penelope and Luna. Nice tattoos, by the way!        Professor Mandrake: *Giggles* Buttering me up will do you no good!                                  Orion: I wasn't really trying to...                                                                 Professor Mandrake: The assumption of Potions being an easy subject ends today! You're the 33rd team to come here. Do you know how many have passed my challenge?                                       Orion: 28?                                                                                          Professor Mandrake: Zilch. Nada. ZERO, baby!                                                        Orion: Ok... Well, maybe we’ll be the ones to change that.                                          Professor Mandrake: Hm, I doubt that. But I admire your confidence!                                 Orion: So what's the challenge?                                                                     Professor Mandrake: It’s super simple! I have prepared the potion on the table before you. You can  look at it, smell it, and even taste it. Your only task is to tell me the potion’s three main       ingredients. Take all the time you need, but remember, you must get all three of them correct. If   you name one ingredient that's not in the potion, you will have failed the challenge.               Luna: Hmm...                                                                                        Orion: Oof, I don't think Penny and I can help you much here, Luna. Any ideas?                      Luna: The potion is colorless and odorless. It could be anything, really. I guess our best bet would be to taste it and see its effects. Depending on what happens, I might know the answer.            Professor Mandrake: Fear not, the potion will do you no harm...                                     Orion: Don’t worry, I’ll be the guinea pig and drink it. If it makes me do something dumb, just     don’t use it as future blackmail against me, alright?                                               Penelope: Nah, I'll drink it. You know more about Eternum than me, Orion. I'm the only one who      doesn’t bring much knowledge to the table here.                                                     Luna: Are you sure, Penelope?                                                                       Penelope: Of course. Nothing ventured, nothing gained! *Drinks the potion* Aaaaa... It tastes       like... liquor. But with a lot of sugar.                                                            Luna: Do you feel any different?                                                                    Penelope: Um... No, I don't think so.                                                               Professor Mandrake: You got some balls on ya, girl. Most people would be extremely wary about trying any sort of unknown potion. You should consider visiting the Yggdrasil server. You’d be a good     Valkyrie.                                                                                           Penelope: Thanks!                                                                                   Professor Mandrake: How many boyfriends do you have?                                                Penelope: *Giggles* Boyfriends? Like, plural? ...I don't have any.                                  Professor Mandrake: What? Are you serious? Ah, I see. So you must be the type to steer away from    such commitments and use whomever you must to satisfy your strictly carnal needs. Have a new man    every night, then?                                                                                  Penelope: *Giggles* Jesus, no. That's not my style at all.                                          Professor Mandrake: No way! You have a body made to fuck, baby. Oh, excuse my language... sometimes I forget I am a Professor. What I meant to say was, you have a body that yearns to practice         procreation and the hips to bear much fruit! Don’t go wasting it! Why don't you have a boyfriend?   Penelope: Um... I don't know... *chuckles* Maybe I'm just waiting for my Prince Charming.           Professor Mandrake: Mmm. More traditional in that sense, then. So you would like to have a          boyfriend?                                                                                          Penelope: To be honest... yeah, I've been thinking about it lately. It'd be nice to have someone to cuddle with at night.                                                                               Professor Mandrake: Aww, you're the romantic type too, aren't you?                                  Penelope: I guess so.                                                                               Professor Mandrake: But, level with me here... when you’re in the sack... do you want your prince   charming to be soft and gentle with you, or to fuck you hard and fast?! Agh! Damn it! I mean...     Would you prefer your romantic partner to maintain a modest, unassuming tempo when conducting the   repetitive motions of intercourse? Or would you like them to exert their full strength to truly     deliver the maximum impact of their heightened sexual arousal?!                                     Penelope: I definitely want to be fucked hard and fast!                                             Professor Mandrake: As I suspected...                                                               Luna: Uhh...                                                                                        Penelope: *Clears throat* Anyway, I'm probably talking too much. Let's focus on the challenge.      Professor Mandrake: So... If you're not fuckin – if you aren’t copulating with anyone... you must be resorting to other methods to relieve your sexual urges. Do you pleasure yourself?                 Penelope: Well yeah, of course.                                                                     Orion: (Interesting...)                                                                             Penelope: Um... I'm not sure why I said that. L-Let's change the subject.                           Professor Mandrake: When was the last time you touched yourself?                                    Penelope: This morning, in the bathroom. Right after Orion used the shower.                         Orion: (VERYYYYYY INTERESTING.)                                                                     Penelope: . . .                                                                                     Luna: I think I know what potion you drank...                                                       Professor Mandrake: That sounds soooo hot! Did you utilize – oh fuck this Professor bullshit... Did you use your fingers? Maybe use the shower head?                                                    Penelope: Both!                                                                                     Professor Mandrake: Did you cum?                                                                    Penelope: No! For some reason, I’ve been having a hard time reaching that finish line lately! WHAT  IS GOING ON?!                                                                                       Professor Mandrake: Have you tried using toys?                                                      Penelope: Yes!                                                                                      Professor Mandrake: *Giggles* Which ones?                                                           Penelope: A vibrator! I have it hidden in my room!                                                  Luna: It's Veritaserum! It forces you to truthfully answer any question you’re given!               Penelope: You fucking bitch! We're out of here!                                                     Professor Mandrake: Not until you guess ALL the ingredients of the potion.                          Penelope: Luna?!                                                                                    Luna: I d-don't remember them...                                                                    Penelope: WHAT?!                                                                                    Professor Mandrake: Have you ever secretly fingered yourself while other people were also in the    room?                                                                                               Penelope: One time, while Dalia and Mom were just a few feet away from me! The risk of getting      caught turned me on so much!                                                                        Professor Mandrake: Is Dalia your sister? Damn that’s hot. Have you ever made out with a woman?     Penelope: My friend Laura when I was 15!                                                            Professor Mandrake: Have you been to the Emporium yet?                                              Penelope: Yes!                                                                                      Professor Mandrake: Did their items turn you on?                                                    Penelope: The rope! I liked it when I was tied up with it! The thought of being fucked while being  like that was just... Mmmm...                                                                       Professor Mandrake: Naughty!                                                                        Penelope: Not yet!                                                                                  Professor Mandrake: Ah, too bad... Have you gotten a boob job?                                      Penelope: Of course not!                                                                            Professor Mandrake: Damn, those balloons are real?! I’m so jealous! Were you thinking of someone    when you fingered yourself this morning?                                                            Penelope: Yes!                                                                                      Professor Mandrake: Who?                                                                            Penelope: I... A friend!                                                                            Professor Mandrake: Ah, trying to avoid answering the question through simple statements instead,   huh? Clever girl. A friend from college?                                                            Penelope: No!                                                                                       Professor Mandrake: Have you ever had sex with this guy you were thinking of?                       Penelope: No!                                                                                       Professor Mandrake: Was he Orion?                                                                   Penelope: Hhgg... YES!                                                                              Orion: WH–                                                                                          Penelope: GOD NO!                                                                                   Orion: (That's too bad...)                                                                          Penelope: LUNA!!!                                                                                   Luna: What?                                                                                         Penelope: THE INGREDIENTS, PLEASE!!                                                                 Luna: Oh yeah, true, um... What was the one that short-legged guy told us about... Syrup of Arnica? Professor Mandrake: WRONG! Sorry guys, rules are rules. You got one ingredient wrong, and therefore you have failed the challenge. Please leave the tower at once, so another team can attempt to win   the stamp.                                                                                          Orion: What?! A guy downstairs told us that Syrup of Arnica was one of the correct ingredients!     Professor Mandrake: I know! I hired him to mislead the students. He tells that bullshit to everyone about to enter the tower.                                                                           Orion: What?! You're a fucking scammer!                                                             Professor Mandrake: I'm the Professor here. My classroom, my rules. Did you forget which House I am the head of?! I live and breathe all that is evil, baby!                                            Penelope: This entire challenge was such bullshit! You're the worst.                                Professor Mandrake: *Giggles* Come on, don't be like that! We just got to know each other a little  better. Just admit that you enjoyed it!                                                             Penelope: I hated it!                                                                               Professor Mandrake: Don't get mad... Friends are supposed to share juicy details between them!      Penelope: But we're not friends!                                                                    Professor Mandrake: Aww...                                                                          Penelope: *Looking at you out of the corner of her eye* And FYI, the potion didn't even work        properly! Some of the things it forced me to say weren't even true! Now I’m gonna have to deal with Luna and... Orion... having false assumptions about me!                                             Professor Mandrake: I don't know, my potions are over 95% effective...                              Luna: Maybe this one happened to fall in the 5% range...                                            Penelope: Obviously! T-That must be it.                                                             Orion: (Hmm...) Can you just give us the stamp and we’ll get on with our happy lives?               Professor Mandrake: Of course not. This is a classroom, not a charity house! BE GONE!               Orion: Come on, we're running late already and we need that stamp! There must be something we can do in exchange for it! And you just said how evil you are. Cheating is evil! So you should be all     about cheating! Look at that, we both win! What do you say?                                         Professor Mandrake: Hmm... Well Orion, I like your style. Fuck it, let's cheat. That'd get          Bundledore all upset. I like it. Your BDSM-lover friend said you’ve all been to the Emporium        already, right?                                                                                     Penelope: That potion didn't work properly!                                                         Orion: *Chuckles* Yeah, we've been there.                                                           Professor Mandrake: So you know Wenlin.                                                             Orion: Yup!                                                                                         Professor Mandrake: She needed some ingredients to prepare a Polyjuice potion, so I sent them to    her, but she hasn’t paid me back yet. Have you been in the Emporium?                                Orion: Not yet, but we were planning to go there.                                                   Professor Mandrake: Good. There's a girl named Wenlin that works there. I sent her some ingredients so she could prepare a special potion, but she hasn’t paid me yet. She owes me 200 eternals. Ask her for the money and then bring it back to me. If you do that... I'll give you my stamp.              Orion: That can certainly be done!                                                                  Professor Mandrake: Great! We have a deal. Now go, I have more students to scam.                    Orion: See you in a bit! (I still think I've seen this place somewhere before...)                   Luna: I always liked Dark Arts. Much better than its counterpart, Defense Against the Dark Arts, if you ask me. We're almost there! The church is up ahead.                                             Orion: A church?                                                                                    Luna: Yeah, the Warthogs server used to be the property of a cult before Professor Bundledore bought it at an auction.                                                                                  Penelope: This definitely looks like somewhere rituals took place. Are there many cults in Eternum? Luna: Yeah, quite a few. Some are rather friendly, and others... not so much.                       Penelope: I hope we don't cross paths with any of those not so friendly ones... Wow, this place is  in rough condition.                                                                                 Luna: It was already like this when Professor Bundledore bought the server. Cults and sects are not illegal in Eternum, as long as they don't break any general rules, of course. Apparently this one   crossed the line though. The Praetorians ended up coming in and turning the place inside out.       Professor B said it would be a fitting setting to teach Dark Arts here, so he left it like this.    Orion: Why... Why does this place look familiar to me?                                              Luna: Familiar?                                                                                     Orion: Yeah, I don't know, it's like... I've seen this church somewhere before.                     Penelope: Maybe in some illustration online? Or in an Eternum advertisement?                        Orion: Hmm... yeah, maybe.                                                                          Penelope: W-What happened? I can't see anything! Guys?                                              Luna: Lumina. Maybe we’re being tested already. In Dark Arts, they took advantage of people's fear  of the dark quite a lot.                                                                            Penelope: Whoa, that's awesome, Luna! I don't know why, but this light gives off a very...          comforting and serene vibe.                                                                         Luna: It was one of the first spells I learned when I started playing Eternum. It has a level 2     requirement, but I can teach you whenever you reach it.                                             Penelope: That'd be awesome, thank you!                                                             Luna: For now though, I’ll create a couple more for us. They’ll follow you wherever you go and      illuminate some of the path in front of you.                                                        Penelope: Great!                                                                                    Professor Abbott: Welcome, students. I'm Professor Abbott, and this is Dark Arts. I assume you've   come to get my stamp for the Triwizard Tournament.                                                  Orion: Yes sir.                                                                                     Professor Abbott: Then you're in luck. My challenge is an easy one. All you have to do is locate my clay jar, which is hidden within this church, and bring it back to me.                              Orion: A jar? Sounds simple enough. What's the catch?                                               Professor Abbott: Nothing. Just the jar in exchange for my stamp.                                   Orion: Alright, cool.                                                                               Professor Abbott: However! It’s easy, but not too easy!                                             Orion: You just said there was no ca–                                                               Professor Abbott: The church is crawling with Boggles!                                              Orion: Boggles?                                                                                     Luna: A Boggle is a shape-shifting being that can be found in Eternum. They don't normally hurt     people though, they only want to scare ‘em. They're often used to distract people from their        objective, and I guess for us, that would mean the jar. But don't worry, they can be easily         neutralized by reciting the spell, "Impedenim".                                                     Penelope: Sounds easy!                                                                              Luna: It is. Just be careful with them, as some are willing to turn into anything just to confuse   you. And the more powerful they are, the more information they can retrieve from you. The stronger  ones are even capable of taking the form of the observer's worst fears.                             Penelope: Well that's not encouraging...                                                            Professor Abbott: You look like a well-prepared team. Well, the clock is ticking. Go get that jar!  I'll be waiting here...                                                                             Luna: I think our best option would be to split up.                                                 Penelope: Good idea.                                                                                Orion: Y-Yeah, sure.                                                                                Luna: Orion can take the left, and you can go right, Penelope. I'll go look behind the altar.       Penelope: Alright! Good luck!                                                                       Orion: Let’s meet back here in 15 minutes if we can't find the jar.                                 Luna: Okay!                                                                                         Orion: (Where could this jar be? This place doesn’t really have many items laying around, so it     should be in plain sight. This church is gigantic. And it's completely silent. Man, I've got a bad  feeling about this... Hmm? These stairs again? Goddammit, I must be going around in circles.)       *Turning around* Oh shit, w-what the fuck is that... (Is this one of those Boggles that Luna        mentioned? It certainly doesn't look like another student...) Um... hey, buddy ‘ol pal... h-have you seen a little... jar laying around somewhere? Holy fuck! Forget the jar! You need to find your jaw! OH, FUCK!! GET AWAY FROM ME!!! I-Impedenim! IMPEDENIM!!! *Hyperventilating* F-Fuck! (That son of a bitch was gonna attack me! I thought Luna said they don't normally hurt people!)                    Luna: Holy shit! Good shot, Orion!                                                                  Orion: Luna! Thanks! That thing was about to jump me!                                               Luna: I saw! These boggles can be some crazy little motherfuckers, eh?                              Orion: Yeah... So... I’ve been running around this area but haven’t been able to find anything. Have you had any luck?                                                                                  Luna: Nah, I didn't find jack shit either.                                                          Orion: Ok... Um... Are you alright, Luna? I don’t think I've ever heard you swear before.           Luna: *Laughs* Guess I’m just a little on edge myself! But nah, I’m okay!                           Orion: Are you sure? You don't seem fine to me...                                                   Luna: The fuck you talking about, bro? *Spits on the floor* I'm fuckin’ Luna! Can’t you see, numb   nuts?!                                                                                              Orion: . . .                                                                                        Luna: . . .                                                                                         Orion: . . .                                                                                        Luna: . . .                                                                                         Orion: HOLY SHIT!!! IMPEDENIM! Goddamnit! (T-They can literally take the form of anyone! This is so fucked up... Shit, I think it’s been over 15 minutes now... I should go back to our meeting point.  Maybe the girls have already found the jar.                                                         Penelope: This place is giving me the chills. I haven’t found the jar... or anyone at all, really. I should go back with Orion and Luna.)                                                               Orion: PENELOPE!!! I was looking all over for you!                                                  Penelope: Goddammit, Orion, you scared me!                                                          Orion: You're not gonna believe what I found!                                                       Penelope: The jar?                                                                                  Orion: Nah, forget about that. It’s something much better! I discovered a room where you can see the future!                                                                                            Penelope: What? The future?                                                                         Orion: Yeah, it blew my mind. I saw myself 10 years from now and it was super cool! I still had a   head full of hair, too! Go see for yourself!                                                        Penelope: This room?                                                                                Orion: Yes, that’s the one. Go in, go in!                                                           Penelope: (Hmm? There's a woman in here.)                                                           Mysterious woman: W-Where am I? W-What is this place?                                               Penelope: Hello?                                                                                    Mysterious woman: This room looks familiar, but I can't... How on earth did I get here?!            Penelope: Hello, Miss! Can I help you?                                                              Mysterious woman: What? Oh finally, somebody! I don't know where... *Gasps* Oh my god, it can’t be  possible... That’s why this place is so familiar... I was here when I was 21!                       Penelope: Are you participating in the Triwizard Tournament too?                                    Mysterious woman: I can't believe I'm talking with my younger self...                               Penelope: What? What do... Wait a second, what are you talking about?                               Penelope: Don't you understand? I'm you! From the future! Oh my god, I must have traveled back in   time somehow...                                                                                     Penelope: Whaaaat? There’s no way! You can’t be me... I mean... no offense, ma'am, but... there's no way I'd look like that in the future.                                                              Penelope: Oh, sweetheart... I remember when I used to think I’d always remain beautiful... But then I stopped exercising, taking care of my hair, maintaining my smooth skin, and getting rid of my body odor... Oh god, honey, the body odor is gonna get soooo much worse... And before I knew it, all my dreams were shattered.                                                                              Penelope: What?? You’ve got to be kidding me. Didn't my modeling career work out?                   Penelope: Modeling career? Who would want to hire a pimple-faced model with floppy tits?            Penelope: My tits are gonna sag?! But that never happened to Mom!                                   Penelope: Some are luckier than others, I guess. Now I just own a pair of flapjacks. And I have     terrible back pain too! If this is what 30 years old looks like, I can’t imagine how we’re gonna be at 40!                                                                                              Penelope: You're only 30?! You look... 50!                                                          Penelope: Yeah... when Mom comes to visit, most people think she’s my daughter. It’s pretty         embarrassing, but I at least appreciate her company. She’s the only one to ever visit...            Penelope: O-Only Mom? Does that mean you live alone...? What about a family? I want to get married  and have children!                                                                                  Penelope: Nope, didn’t work out that way. But at least we have a cute cat named Nala...             Penelope: Oh, well that’s better than nothing, I guess... How old is Nala?                          Penelope: She’s four! Well, she was four... until I accidentally sat on her while watching The Big  Lebowski.                                                                                           Penelope: Oh, come on! Nala is dead?!                                                               Penelope: If only I had gone to college, instead of pursuing a stupid career in modeling and playing Eternum all day...                                                                                 Penelope: But...! Wait a second... What do you mean by, "if I had gone to college"? I did go to     college. I'm still in it right now.                                                                 Penelope: Yeah, I meant... If my grades had been better, I wouldn't have had to drop out. So many   years of playing Eternum finally took its toll.                                                     Penelope: My grades are great. And today is actually my first time playing Eternum.                 Penelope: Agh, typical Penny mixing up words... I meant, if you had... er, if we had...             Penelope: What am I majoring in?                                                                    Penelope: Um... God, it's been a while, I forgot. It was... uh... photography?                      Penelope: You're one of those monsters!                                                             Penelope: No, I'm not! I'm you, Penelope!                                                           Penelope: Nothing in the universe could ever force me into wearing that truly horrendous-looking    skirt!                                                                                              Penelope: Don’t be in denial! It's just that... I'm a bit dizzy and I don't remember...             Penelope: IMPEDENIM! I knew it! *Giggles* Oh my god, I disintegrated that thing! So COOL!!          Orion: Penelope? What the fuck happened?                                                            Penelope: Orion! This place is just a trap! Our future selves aren’t in here, they’re only the      creatures Luna warned us about!                                                                     Orion: Damn, really? I'm sorry, I didn't know. This place is so fucked up. Let's just get out of    here. We can get our stamp at one of the other subjects.                                            Penelope: Orion... can I confess something to you...?  *Giggles* Casting a spell for the first time has... really turned me on...                                                                       Orion: Oh, really?                                                                                  Penelope: Mm, yeah... it just made me feel so powerful and in control... Why don't we forget about  Luna and the stamps, for just a little bit, and try to find some place nice and private? I need to  shove that dick inside of me so bad... I want to pin you to the ground and ride the hell out of     you...                                                                                              Orion: That sounds so fucking great...                                                              Penelope: Are you gonna fuck me, daddy?                                                             Orion: I'm gonna fuck your brains out...                                                            Penelope: I want a repeat of what we tried the other day. You remember? When we were using the      Chinese ball toys...                                                                                Orion: How could I forget, baby...                                                                  Penelope: Hah! Nice try, Boggle!                                                                    Orion: W-What? What are you doing, Penelope?!                                                       Penelope: Your looks are pretty convincing, but I'm afraid I caught you in a lie. Orion and I have  never fucked.                                                                                       Orion: But it'd be nice, right Penelope?                                                            Penelope: Hu-W-What... don't change the subject! Of course not. Ugh! And the real Orion always calls me "Penny"! Impedenim! Wow... The spell even leaves a tingling feeling in my fingers... *Giggles*  (This is even more fun than I thought it would be! I should have listened to Dalia months ago when  she told me to try out Eternum!) AAAAAAAAHHHHH! WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!! PEDENIM! IMPENIM!!!        PENIDIM! IMPENIMIM!!! I-IMPENIS-M! PEDENIMIM!!! PENIMUM! IMPEDENINIM!!! PENIDIM! IMPEDENIM!!!       Hmm...? *Giggles* (Did it again! You go girl! Mmm... maybe I wasn’t lying earlier when I said magic turns me on... I gotta find more monsters to zap!                                                   Luna: This is the last place I haven't looked. If it's not here, Orion or Penelope must have found  it already.) Hmm... (The jar! Finally. Just gotta grab it real quick and then head back to the      meeting point. It's been way over 15 minutes and I don’t want to keep them waiting.)                ???: . . .                                                                                          Luna: Impedenim. Sorry. (Back to Professor Abbott. We completed the challenge. The fastest way back should be through that–) *Whispering* Mom?                                                          Luna's Mom: Why did you kill me, Luna?                                                              Luna: W-What?                                                                                       Luna's Mom: Why did you kill me? Was I not a loving mother to you? Did I do something wrong?        Luna: You didn't do anything wrong.                                                                 Luna's Mom: Then why did you kill me?                                                               Luna: I d-didn't kill you.                                                                          Luna's Mom: Is that what you've been trying to tell yourself? I'm dead because of you, Luna. You    killed me the day you touched me with those wretched hands of yours.                                Luna: I... I’m unable to change someone’s future... I can only see what’s to come, Mom...           Luna's Mom: Lies. If you hadn't confined me to demise, I’d still be alive today. You threw death    upon my doorstep. You are the one who killed me.                                                    Luna: I d-didn't ask to see that... I didn't want it to happen... I loved you.                      Luna's Mom: How many more people must suffer because of you, Luna? Why do you continue to carry that curse and risk the lives of everyone who crosses your path? End your life and cease your pathetic  existence already. You’d be doing us all a favor. You'd be doing your father a favor. He’s had to   put up with you and your parasitic essence for far too long. Do you really think anyone would even  notice your passing? No. Why would they? You're alone. You'll always be alone. It's no coincidence  you've never had any friends. People hold you in contempt. They flee from you. And you should know  all this better than anyone. You’re the one who has to live with yourself. You're a monster, Luna. A freak. An abomination. A regrettable existence.                                                    Orion: I know I never got the privilege of meeting your mother. But if she was even a fraction of   who you are, I know she also was an amazing person. These boggles are pretty convincing, I’ll       admit... especially when they manage to take hold of and exploit our deepest fears. It can be so    unnerving. But if you pay close attention... it can be quite easy to end their charade. As          compelling as their disguises are, there’s still a few cracks in their facade. They aren’t real. And they don’t speak of what’s true. This one here... couldn’t have been further from the truth. You're no monster, Luna. You're not a freak. *Chuckles* I know your father wouldn’t even hesitate to give his life a hundred times over for you. Him having to put up with you? That’s a complete lie. You    know what’s not a lie, though? You're not alone. And you're never going to be alone again.          Luna: . . . Impedenim.                                                                              Orion: A-Are you okay? I'm sorry, I didn't want to...                                               Luna: I'm okay! It's just that... I'm not used to anyone touching my hands. Even if my visions don't work in Eternum, I guess I just instinctively avoid physical contact...                            Orion: *Chuckles* That makes sense. I hope that piece of shit didn’t make you feel too bad. I'm     sorry I couldn't arrive sooner.                                                                     Luna: It did sting a bit, at first... I don't really know what happened. I've faced boggles before, and I know they can feed on our fears. I just... wasn't expecting one to take the shape of my mom.  It knew exactly what to say too. Just twisted that knife. And I... froze. My mind went blank. Until you arrived. Thank you, Orion. I don't really know what would’ve happened if you hadn't walked in.  Thank you for everything you said. It was... sweet.                                                 Orion: I'm sure you'd have realized that thing was speaking gibberish sooner or later... I just     saved you some time, that’s all.                                                                    Luna: Thank you.                                                                                    Orion: And now, let's go back to Professor Abbott! We have a stamp to claim!                        Luna: Yes!                                                                                          Orion: *Panting* Oh Jesus, it's finally over...                                                     Professor Abbott: Ahhh, excellent, excellent! That is indeed my jar! An exact replica of one crafted by my Great-Grandfather Dang Lin Wang! You all just earned yourselves a stamp! Congratulations. Not many teams were able to complete my challenge today. The boggles can be very mischievous! Did you  enjoy it, at least?                                                                                 Luna: Sure, it was very entertaining.                                                               Penelope: It was super fun!                                                                         Orion: (Phew, thank god Luna managed to find that jar. I was completely lost.) Yep!                 Professor Abbott: I'm glad to hear that. Okay, I won't keep you any longer. Good luck with the      tournament!                                                                                         Luna: Thanks!                                                                                       Orion: We already have the Conjuration stamp. So... Conjuration is taught here? Outdoors?           Luna: Usually.                                                                                      Orion: Who’s the teach– F-FUCK! Can you stop doing that?!                                           Professor Bundledore: Welcome to Conjuration! The most elite, challenging, and prestigious subject  in all of Warthogs! I assume you're here to earn my stamp!                                          Penelope: Yes!                                                                                      Orion: What's the challenge?                                                                        Professor Bundledore: Ah, straight to the point, huh? I like it. You see... since its inception, the School of Conjuration is to thank for the raising of dead, the summoning of creatures, and         countless other unique abilities. The lessons taught here have made our skill one of the most       powerful in the game! Because of that, my challenge must be one that is worthy of the Conjuration   name. In order to obtain the stamp, you must defeat another team of wizards in single combat!       Penelope: What? Like a duel? Well that’s just great. Chalk me up for a loss already because I've    never used any conjuration spell before.                                                            Luna: No worries, Penelope. It’s not as hard as you think. All you have to do is recite the spell,  "Increarbus Severum". Anyone can use the incantation, but the more knowledge you have and the more  you practice it, the stronger your summoned creatures will be.                                      Penelope: Ugh, well, I'll try.                                                                      Luna: It's totally normal if you don’t summon anything the first time. In fact, most people can’t.  When I started, I couldn't even summon a rabbit for several weeks. So you’ll probably end up empty  handed also.                                                                                        Penelope: Thank you, Luna! You sure know how to encourage someone!                                  Orion: It'll be my first time as well, Penny, so I wouldn't worry too much about it. We just came   here to learn the basics and have some fun, after all.                                              Penelope: Yeah, that's true. We didn't even know about the tournament until we got here.            Orion: So... now we wait for another team of 3?                                                     Professor Bundledore: Lucky for you, Marvolo, Melton, and Jade have already been waiting and they’re ready to fight for the stamp!                                                                      Jade: Another team is here? Fucking finally.                                                        Melton: *Laughs* Did they say it was their first time? This will be a piece of cake.                Marvolo: We were waiting for almost ten whole minutes! Now my spell-casting arm is all stiff!       Professor Bundledore: Okay, students! Gather your things and let's go to the Duel Overpass! There's no time to waste!                                                                                   Luna: The Duel Overpass is at the top of the wall. I'll give you some tips on the way there.        Penelope: Cool!                                                                                     Professor Bundledore: Alright now! Let's give it up for our first duel! Remember, it is forbidden to attack the wizard directly, so focus all actions on your opponent’s creature only. One match per   team member. The overall winning team will get the stamp! For our first participant, I’d like to    introduce you to Jade – one of Warthogs' most gifted students! She’s sitting at a very respectable  level 19! And next up we have... Penelope. You said you’re... level 1, right sweetie?               Penelope: Mm-hm.                                                                                    Professor Bundledore: Excellent!                                                                    Orion: Don't worry, Penny! You got this!                                                            Luna: Remember to recite the incantation clearly! Enunciate every letter! And try to keep your mind clear!                                                                                              Melton: You can do it, Jade!                                                                        Marvolo: She better. If she doesn't win against a level 1, first-time player, I'm gonna die of      laughter.                                                                                           Jade: Are you ready to eat dust, bitch?                                                             Penelope: . . .                                                                                     Jade: Cat got your tongue, or what?                                                                 Penelope: . . .                                                                                     Jade: Whatever, not worth the effort. Can’t sit here while we have other stamps to win, y’know?     Increarbus Severum! My undefeated Stone Golem! What are you gonna summon to face it?!               Penelope: (Okay Penelope, just remain calm and remember what Luna told you. It's your first time, so there's no pressure. It’s normal if you can’t summon anything.) *Taking a deep breath*  Increarbus Severum.                                                                                            Penelope's frog: *Croaks*                                                                           Penelope: OH MY GOD!! I did it! I summoned something! I created life! YAY! I'm a sorceress now!! Did you see that, guys?!                                                                               Orion: Nice job, Penny!                                                                             Luna: Better than my first attempt! I'm impressed!                                                  Penelope: Aww... it's so cute! I'm gonna call him Kermit!                                           Kermit: *Croaks*                                                                                    Penelope: Come here, lil’ Kermie–                                                                   Jade: *Laughs* That was the easiest duel of my life!                                                Orion: (Oof, that was rough.) Don't be sad, Penny! No one is expecting us to win! You and I are both pretty much noobs!                                                                                 Penelope: Becoming a model, going to college, trying out summoning... I'm a failure at everything.  Orion: *Chuckles* You know that's not true.                                                         Penelope: And they killed my Kermit...                                                              Orion: His life may have been short, but it was jam-packed with adventure!                          Professor Bundledore: The first duel concludes with Jade as the victor! Now, the next duel is quite the anticipated one. On this side, we have the school’s best conjurer at present! And he will be    facing the school’s best conjurer... from two years ago! Good luck!                                 Marvolo: Luna... I've heard a lot about you. *Laughs* People say you were quite the loner who never spoke to anyone. A total outcast. No offense, of course...                                          Luna: None taken.                                                                                   Marvolo: But they also say you were the best conjurer the school had ever seen... that is, until I  arrived. It's time to show everyone how much of a difference two years can make! Behold... witness  the might of what a true Dark Wizard can do! INCREARBUS SEVERUM! My ultimate creation. The Pharaoh  Mummy! An immortal being! You can try to burn, drown, or decapitate him... but you’ll never succeed in killing him. The Pharaoh Mummy cannot die! He possesses the power of the ten Egyptian plagues!   HE'S DEATH INCARNATE! *Laughs* You can surrender now, Luna. Keep the remains of your reputation     intact. You shouldn’t embarrass yourself.                                                           Luna: *Taking a deep breath*                                                                        Marvolo: *Laughs* OooOoOoh, shiny eyes. Sooo scary...                                               Luna: Increarbus severum.                                                                           Marvolo: *Laughs* What the fuck? Does that guy have a triangle for a head? I’ve never seen anything so ridiculous. Cool hit, bro! Applaud the effort, Luna, but you still don’t understand... Your      gorilla can try all he wants to cut down my Pharaoh Mummy, but it’s no use! HE IS IMMORTAL!         Pyramid Head: The time of judgment has come. The depths of hell demand your return.                 Marvolo: . . . W-What...?                                                                           Luna: Thank you, Pyri.                                                                              Professor Bundledore: Wow, what a finish! The winner of the second duel is Luna! It all comes down  to this. Melton, Orion, please come to the bridge to break the tie!                                 Marvolo: W-What the fuck?! What just happened?!                                                     Jade: You got your ass handed to you, that's what happened.                                         Marvolo: But... but... my Pharaoh Mummy... he’s the pinnacle of Conjuration! He can't be defeated!  Jade: That’s the pinnacle? Damn, maybe I need to start practicing another magic...                  Marvolo: Where did she send him to?!                                                                Jade: Back to Egypt, I guess.                                                                       Penelope: Oh my god, that was amazing, Luna!                                                        Luna: Thanks! Pyri is one of my most powerful summons. I can only call him once every 10 days, but I thought it’d be worth it.                                                                          Penelope: Definitely!                                                                               Melton: Don't worry Marvolo, I got your back! I'll get us this stamp and wrap this up quickly!      Increarbus severum! Behold, my merciless Cyclops! You have no chance against his wrath!             Orion: (Alright, this is my moment to shine. I might not have used this spell before, but I've been spending a lot of time practicing magic in general. And according to Dalia, I catch on faster than  most. Now remember what Luna mentioned earlier. Focus on a specific point and concentrate on        summoning a powerful being. Maybe a bear! No... a giant! With a flaming sword, acid breath, and     spiky horns!)                                                                                       Melton: *Laughs* What the hell is that purple shit on the floor?                                    Jade: *Laughs* I think he even forgot to speak the incantation.                                     Orion: (Come on...!) W-What?!                                                                       Luna: *Whispering* Oh my god... is that... Calypso? I didn't know Orion could summon her.           Penelope: *Whispering* Calypso... the elven girl you told me about? The "Weapon"?                   Luna: Yeah...                                                                                       Penelope: She's so pretty!                                                                          Calypso: *Standing up* What the... Where in Tir Na Lia am I...? Where is the lake? What is this     magic?                                                                                              Orion: Um... Hello?                                                                                 Calypso: Hmm? Oh... of course. I should have guessed. What have you done now?                       Orion: N-Nothing! I don't know what happened! I was trying to summon something and then... you      appeared.                                                                                           Calypso: You opened a portal? Why did you not contact me first?                                     Orion: I wasn’t messing with any portals! I just happened to... summon you, I guess!                Melton: Enough talk! Human form or not, your conjuration must face my mighty Cyclops!               Orion: Where were you?                                                                              Calypso: Where else would I be? I was where you last left me, near that putrid inn! I will have you know, that is no place for a princess. The perverted gawking of the farmers whenever they see me is despicable! If they were to try that within my realm, they would all be sentenced to death!         Orion: And... um... what are you wearing?                                                           Calypso: I went to the lake to be alone. I was hoping some meditation could restore some of my      memory.                                                                                             Orion: Makes sense. (Man, I'm seeing the nipples of a Princess! Today, the blessings continue.      Pretty sure that's a cardinal sin in Calypso's world, though. It'd be better if I don't mention her robes are see-through.)                                                                             Melton: I don't have all day! Let's fight!!                                                         Orion: Well, you can stay with us if you want. These are my friends, Penelope and Luna.             Penelope: Hi!                                                                                       Luna: Hello.                                                                                        Calypso: More women? Exactly how many maidens are in your harem?                                    Orion: W-What?                                                                                      Penelope: *Giggles* That's a good question! Yeah, tell us Orion! Just how many maidens are in your  harem?                                                                                              Orion: Zero, alright! She's only referring to Nova and Alex! We were all playing together when we   first met her!                                                                                      Penelope: *Giggles* Sure, sure...                                                                   Professor Bundledore: Oh my god, this has to be the most exquisite conjuration I've ever witnessed  in Warthogs. How did you manage to invoke such a divine, angelic creature, Orion?                   Calypso: Finally, someone who treats me with proper respect. My name is Ca–                         Orion: C-Carrie. Her name is Carrie. She's my cousin. Totally loves to roleplay as an elf. Right,   Carrie? *Whispering* Have you forgotten that everyone is trying to hunt you down for your powers?!  Calypso: Mmm... Yeah, well. I would like to see them try...                                         Professor Bundledore: An elf, you say? Well, well, well... my wife and I love to roleplay as elves  on our Sexy Sundays... we could always use another participant!                                     Calypso: . . . I guess I spoke too soon about that proper respect... Anyway, I am going back to that poor excuse of an inn. Do not dare summon me again, unless it is an urgent matter. I hate being    interrupted.                                                                                        Orion: Lucky for you, I don’t think I could repeat that if I tried. But... speaking of urgent       matters, we've put together a team to retrieve a very powerful item. If you're bored at that inn... we'd be honored for you to join us. Since last time you said you were willing to help...            Calypso: Mmmm... I will think ab–                                                                   Melton: FIGHT. MY. CYCLOPS!!!!!!!!!                                                                 Calypso: Holy Mother of Aen Seidhe, can you not see that the Princess is talking here, you filthy   peasant?!! I will think about it.                                                                   Melton: M-My cyclops...                                                                             Orion: O-Okay! Cool!                                                                                Calypso: Glem ni sa' eradin. If... If I were to join you, where should we gather?                   Orion: Either Alex or I will pick you up!                                                           Calypso: All right. But if I do decide to join your little campaign, it will only be because I am   bored, and not because you asked me to do it. We must be absolutely clear on that.                  Orion: Absolutely.                                                                                  Calypso: Good. I will think about it, then. Farewell, Orion.                                        Orion: Farewell!                                                                                    Marvolo: Who the fuck are these people? How the hell did we just lose?!                             Jade: We lost because you two are useless. I don't even know why I play with you guys.              Marvolo: He summoned a stupid sexy elf who could speak like a real human! What kind of magic is     that?!                                                                                              Jade: Come on, let's try to get stamps in the other subjects. We’ve wasted enough time here.        Professor Bundledore: Wow, what an unexpected conclusion to an otherwise thrilling series of duels! Congratulations, guys! You won the final match, so the stamp is yours! A well-deserved victory. How many do you have now? Then you still have some work left to do! No one has claimed the prize yet!   You still have time, but you’ll need to hurry! Oh, you're done, then! And you’re in luck because no one has claimed the prize yet! Meet me near the castle entrance when you're ready. If you're the    first team to arrive there, the prize is yours! Hurry up!                                           Orion: Yes sir! Come on girls, let's go! We have a tournament to win!                               Penelope: On my way!                                                                                Luna: I'm starting to think we can win... We did it! Why did we come here? We don't have 4 stamps   yet.                                                                                                Leave the server                                                                                    Orion: I know, but I'm running a little short on time now. I still have to help Nancy during her    first time in Eternum, and then I gotta discuss the heist preparations with Chang. It'll be better  if I get going now.                                                                                 Luna: Alright, Penelope and I will stay for a bit. I'll try to teach her a few more tricks.         Go back to the castle                                                                               Orion: I just wanted to enjoy the scenery! Let's get those stamps!                                  Professor Bundledore: HELLO AGAIN!                                                                  Orion: JESUS CH–                                                                                    Professor Bundledore: I hope you’re coming to me with some good news...?                            Orion: Yes! We completed all the challenges!                                                        Professor Bundledore: OOOOOH! CONGRATULATIONS! You were one of the last teams to join the           tournament, but you still came out on top! Well done! I was expecting great results from Luna's     team, but still, consider me very impressed! And not only that, you all went the extra mile too!    You’ve gathered not 4, but 5 total stamps! Such hard work deserves an extra reward! Take these 300  eternals! Spend it wisely!  Preferably on Warthogs tuition or at the school's Emporium.             Orion: Whoa, thank you very much! Thanks!                                                           Professor Bundledore: And now, for the main prize, you will be given a choice! These are Grimoires  of Power. One will allow you to learn a powerful spell of restoration, and the other will teach you a mighty spell of destruction!                                                                      Orion: Awesome! Which one should we learn, girls?                                                   Professor Bundledore: Remember, the Grimoire can only deliver its teachings to one individual, so   choose wisely!                                                                                      Orion: Only one?!                                                                                   Professor Bundledore: Those are the rules! Protection or destruction, take your pick!               Luna: Whatever you choose, Orion, I think Penny should have it. I know quite the amount of spells   already.                                                                                            Orion: Seems fair!                                                                                  Penelope: Awww, you're too sweet, guys!                                                             Orion: Hmmm... (What should Penny try to learn...?)                                                 Restoration                                                                                         Orion: (Healing spells could be incredibly useful... And on the phone earlier, I think she mentioned being interested in that type of magic.) We'll take the Restoration Magic.                         Destruction                                                                                         Orion: (Somebody’s gotta be willing to do some damage... I think this could really help our         offenses.) We'll take the Destruction Magic.                                                        Professor Bundledore: Excellent choice! I must return to my duties now but thank you so much for    participating. Congratulations again!                                                               Orion: No, thank you, Professor! Damn, I can't believe we actually won! You girls are the best!     Luna: It was a team effort.                                                                         Orion: Agh, I really wish I could stay longer, but I gotta get going. I still have to help Nancy    during her first time in Eternum, and then I gotta discuss the heist preparations with Chang.       Luna: No problem! I think Penelope and I are gonna stay back for a bit. Might as well start         practicing her new Restoration spells. Might as well start practicing her new Destruction spells.   Penelope: *Giggles* Perfect, because I feel like I’m in the zone already! Don't worry Orion, I'm in good hands!                                                                                         Orion: You definitely are! This has been a lot of fun, girls. I'm looking forward to many more      adventures with my amazing teammates! See you later! Okay then, we'll talk later!                   Penelope: Bye!                                                                                      Orion: (I was worried that Penny would stick out like a sore thumb. I’m glad to see that wasn’t the case. Eternum never ceases to astound me. No visit is ever the same... there’s always an incredible surprise around every corner! And I've only been playing for... a few weeks? Man, this is still only the beginning!) *Removing your visor* Alright! *Looking at your phone* (Hmm... a message from      Dalia. Looks like she's on her way home already. Nice! Just in time! I'll go take a piss and grab   some food while I wait for her and Nancy.) *Yawns* (And maybe take a little nap. Playing Eternum is way more tiring than you’d think...)                                                                Player: 1800 eternals for a horse?!                                                                 Player: Not "a horse", THE horse! You won't find a better cavalry steed in all of Eternum.          Nancy: Mmmmm... (God, I'm so dizzy... I should have asked Idriel about possible side effects...)    *Sniffs* (This place reeks of horses and manure... definitely not helping me feel better...)        Player: Ah! I recognize that scowl! First time?                                                     Nancy: Yeah. Is it that obvious?                                                                    Player: *Laughs* A bit, but don't worry, it happens to all of us. Rest assured, you'll only feel    like this the first time you login.                                                                 Nancy: That's a relief.                                                                             Player: The nausea should be gone in about five or ten minutes. In the meantime, you happen to be in luck! I have something that'll be super helpful for a new player like you.                         Nancy: *Chuckles* I hope it’s some medicine.                                                        Player: No, it’s better! I somehow ended up with one Eternum Premium Subscription to spare, and     since you’re just on the verge of starting your adventure, I figure a veteran like me could lend you a hand. I'll hook you up and sell it to you for only 50 eternals. How does that sound?             Nancy: What? Eternum Premium? I thought Eternum didn't have any monthly fees.                       Player: Oh you didn’t know? They introduced it a couple months ago and it’s turned into a must-have around here! It allows you to buy and sell weapons, change servers, and customize your hair and     makeup!                                                                                             Nancy: I thought I could do that already.                                                           Player: Not without Premium! Tell ya what, 45 eternals and it's yours.                              Nancy: I know I’m new to this whole thing but... that kinda sounds like a scam, to be honest.       Player: Scam? It normally costs like 300 et–                                                        Dalia: Take your Eternum Premium and shove it up your ass, scum bag! Get the fuck out of here!      Nancy: Honey! Oh my god, you look beautiful!                                                        Dalia: Hi, Mom! Sorry about that. People in this server are usually really nice, but these lobby    areas are full of predatory scammers. How are you feeling?                                          Nancy: A little woozy, but I'm starting to feel better already. This place is unreal!               Dalia: Right?! Welcome to Semper Invicta! On this server, you’ll find several Greek and Roman-themed cities. They take their roleplaying seriously here, so you’ll feel totally immersed!               Nancy: That sounds really cool!                                                                     Dalia: I checked Orion's room before I logged on and found him passed out. I sent him an invite     though, so he'll probably join us when he wakes up.                                                 Nancy: Poor thing! I know he got up really early this morning, so a little nap is probably the best thing for him right now.                                                                            Dalia: Yeah, that’s what I was thinking. Alright, I'll start you off with a little tour then. If you go down that way, alongside the main wall you’ll find the stables and the market. If you go the    other direction, there's the Pantheon and... And... Why is there a... Oh shit. Don't tell me that... F-Fuck! Um... Yeah, sorry Mom, we gotta get out of here. Fast.                                     Nancy: Why? Did something happen?                                                                   Dalia: Uhh... that's a Western flag.                                                                Nancy: Western?                                                                                     Dalia: Yeah... um... there’s two factions in this server. You’ve got the Western Roman Empire, or   WRE for short, and the Eastern Roman Empire, or ERE. And if there’s WRE flags hanging around, that  means they’re in control of this city. *Nervous laugh* I've had some... minor disputes... with the  WRE in the past, so I think it’d be best if we just leave and return on another day.                Nancy: Oh... okay then, whatever you say honey. You’re the expert here!                             Maximo: Well, well, well... Look who's here, guys! She finally had the nerve to show her face again! Dalia, Dalia... you sure did take your time.                                                       Dalia: Ohhh... Maximo! Mom, this is the good friend I was juuust gushing to you about!              Maximo: Gentlemen, don’t fall for her tricks. This is the mercenary I told you all about! The one   who worked for those Eastern Empire bastards and wiped out half of our unit.                        Dalia: *Nervous laugh* Half your unit?? That’s a stretch, don’t y’think? How are you doing, my      friend?                                                                                             Maximo: We took the city a few days ago, as you can see. And soon the whole server will be under our control.                                                                                           Dalia: Ah, that's wonderful! Truly am soooo happy for you guys. Best of luck with that! We were just leaving...                                                                                         Maximo: I'm sorry, Dalia. You know we can't allow that.                                             Dalia: W-WHAT?! Get your hands off me!                                                              Legionnaire: *Tying Dalia's hands behind her back* By order of the Emperor, you are hereby under    arrest!                                                                                             Dalia: I haven't done anything!                                                                     Maximo: This isn't personal, Dalia. I admire your skills as a soldier, but the word of the Emperor  is sacred and must be kept.                                                                         Nancy: Erm... Is all this still part of the roleplaying? Or are we seriously being arrested?        Dalia: Um... I'm afraid it’s real. Thanks to a lovely bunch of idiots who only blindly follow       orders...                                                                                           Nancy: So unless they free us, we won’t be able to just log off?                                    Dalia: Y-Yeah... But there's a maximum number of hours set by Eternum's General Code of Ethics.     Maximo: The Western Roman Empire is governed by the Principles of Equality, as dictated by the      Senate of the Roman People. Do not worry, you both shall be treated with respect. We’re not         barbarians like the Eastern Empire...                                                               Dalia: I'm sorry, Mom... this sure is one way for Eternum to make an impression...                  Nancy: No, no, it's okay! It's actually kind of thrilling... in a way. I’ve never been arrested     before!                                                                                             Maximo: Who are you...?                                                                             Nancy: Nancy. I'm Dalia's mother.                                                                   Maximo: Mother? How old are you?                                                                    Nancy: Don't you know it’s not polite to ask a lady that?                                           Maximo: Your hair... is that your natural color?                                                    Nancy: It is.                                                                                       Maximo: Are you telling me the truth? Swear on Zeus that you haven’t customized it!                 Nancy: Um... wouldn't it be Jupiter? But anyway, yeah, I swear on... Zeus.                          Maximo: Interesting... Men, I'll take care of this one. Put Dalia in the cell with the other        airheads.                                                                                           Dalia: Goddammit! You'll regret this!                                                               Orion: Zzzzz... AAAAAAARGHHH! FUCK! Oh my god, that was terrifying! I’ve never had a nightmare like that before. I hardly ever dream in the first place... (Shit, I fell asleep while waiting for       Dalia.) *Looking at your phone* Hmm? (What? They started without me!)                               Connected.                                                                                          Orion: (Why didn't they wake me up?!)                                                               Welcome back to Eternum. You've received an invitation from... Dalia. Would you like to join her    session?                                                                                            Orion: Yes Ma’am!                                                                                   Please prepare to connect...                                                                        Orion: Ohh... (This place is beautiful! It looks just like how I’d imagine ancient Rome... I’m      diggin’ this toga! Comfortable and stylish. And... it doesn’t seem to come with underwear, so... the boys are lovin’ the breeze! Ok... I gotta find Dalia and Nancy. They must be around here           somewhere.)                                                                                         Player: Hi!                                                                                         Orion: Oh, hello there!                                                                             Player: You looking for something?                                                                  Orion: Actually, I am! I'm looking for a friend of mine. She’s the one who invited me to the server.Player: Your best bet is at the Pantheon! Go down this row and head to the left, opposite direction from the market. She probably went there. There's a Rotunda event happening in a few hours.         Orion: Thank you so much!                                                                           Player: No problem!                                                                                 Player: Hi there, mate! Would you like to buy a fresh apple? 30% of the net profits are donated     towards the preservation of the ocean's species and their habitats. Only 1 eternal!                 Orion: Just 1 eternal?                                                                              Buy an apple                                                                                        Orion: Sure, why not! I'll do it for the turtles!                                                   Player: There you go!                                                                               Orion: Thanks! *Eating the apple* Mmmm! It's delicious! So sweet!                                   Player: I'm glad to hear that!                                                                      Don't buy it                                                                                        Orion: Nah, I'm good.                                                                               Player: No problem, sir! If you get hungry later, I’ll be here! Thank you and have a pleasant day!  Orion: You too! (Holy shit, people on this server are so damn nice. Ok, the Pantheon should be right beyond this door... They really take authenticity seriously around here. This whole city is full of so many intricate details and grand designs!)                                                      Player: Good morning, my friend! How are you doing on this wonderful day?                           Orion: Good morning! I’m doing fantastic! Man, I was just thinking about how nice people are around here.                                                                                               Player: It's in our nature! The sun always shines on Semper Invicta! Are you in need of any         assistance?                                                                                         Orion: I'm heading to the Rotunda.                                                                  Player: Ah, excellent! Perfect timing for the upcoming Munus, which is sure to be quite the         spectacle of unrelenting combat! Do you have a ticket to watch the show?                            Orion: A ticket?                                                                                    Player: Yes sir, you will need a ticket for admission to the Rotunda. If the guards catch you       without one, you could end up fighting for your life in the arena instead of cheering from the      stands! I have a few to sell, if you’re interested. They're only 200 eternals.                      Buy a ticket                                                                                        Orion: Oof, thanks for the warning! I'll take one, yeah. Definitely don’t want to lose my level or  inventory...                                                                                        Player: Smart decision, sir!                                                                        Orion: Thank you!                                                                                   Player: Have fun and enjoy the show!                                                                Don't buy it                                                                                        Orion: Thank you, but I'll take my chances.                                                         Player: You sure? I would hate for you to fall into any trouble. Let's make it 190 eternals.        Orion: Yes, I'm sure.                                                                               Player: As you wish... Come back if you have second thoughts...                                     Orion: (This must be the entrance to the Rotunda. I hope I can find Dalia and Nancy here.)          Beggar: My good sir, could you spare some coin...?                                                  Orion: Hmm? I'm sorry?                                                                              Beggar: I just need 6 eternals to buy some food in the real world...                                Orion: Are you... a real player? How does someone have enough money to buy a neural implant, but not enough to buy food?                                                                                Beggar: I lost all my belongings shortly after I bought it, sir. As you know, the implant can't be  transferred or sold after being used, so now it’s the only thing I have left... Please sir, only 6  eternals... that’s all I ask. I’ll exchange them and purchase some food for my hungry daughter...   Orion: . . .                                                                                        Give him 6 eternals                                                                                 Orion: Take this. Go get your daughter a warm meal.                                                 Beggar: Oh sir... Thank you so much... You are too kind...                                          Orion: No problem.                                                                                  Beggar: The other one was also very kind to me...                                                   Don't give him anything                                                                             Orion: I'm sorry, man. Things aren’t gonna get any better for you if you just keep begging all day. Go find a job or something!                                                                         Beggar: . . . That is not what the other one did...                                                 Orion: Hmm? Who?                                                                                    Maximo: Good morning!                                                                               Orion: Wow, cool outfit! Where can I get one for myself?                                            Maximo: I’m afraid they are reserved only for Legionnaires in service of the Emperor.               Orion: Ah, that's too bad.                                                                          Maximo: May I see your ticket?                                                                      Orion: Sure! I just purchased one in the market. (Oh, fuck...) Y-Yeah, I purchased one, but I appear to have misplaced it!                                                                              Maximo: Purchased...? Tickets cannot be purchased. They're distributed by the scribes of the        Emperor. They're free, but you need to know someone from the server to get one.                     Orion: W-What? (That fucking scammer! He swindled me out of 200 eternals!) Oh... (That fucking      scammer! I knew something was fishy about him!) Um... well, lucky for me, I happen to know someone  familiar with this server! I was just looking for her! Her name is Dalia.                           Maximo: . . . You'll have to come with us, sir.                                                     Orion: Do you know who she is? Or where she is?                                                     Maximo: By order of the Emperor, you're under arrest.                                               Orion: I'm sorry, what? Hey, hey, hey! Easy there, bub! What the hell are you doing?!               Maximo: Please do not resist. I’ve already dealt with enough troublemakers today.                   Orion: Let me go! I haven't done anything! I’ve never even been on this server before!              Maximo: Please don’t make this harder than it has to be.                                            Orion: I SAID LET ME GO YOU TW–                                                                     *You get hit in the head*                                                                           Maximo: Put him in the cell along with the others.                                                  Orion: (Fuuuuck... it feels like I got hit by a truck... What the hell happened...? Where am I?)    Maximo: I'm headed to the Rotunda to prepare for the fights. This will be the first Munus since we  regained control of the city, so everything has to be perfect.                                      Orion: *Gets thrown to the ground* (Agh, my head... Motherfuckers...)                               Maximo: Don’t release anyone until I'm back. Understood?                                            Legionnaire: Yes, sir.                                                                              Orion: *Standing up* H-Hey! Hey you! Dingleberry! Open the door! Why the fuck am I here? Let me out! Are you deaf? I demand an explanation!                                                             Dalia: There’s no use. He’s just going to keep ignoring you. Especially if you call him a           dingleberry.                                                                                        Orion: *Turning around* Huh? Dalia! Thank god, it's so good to see you! I was just... Wow... you    look... hot.                                                                                        Dalia: Yeah, yeah, whatever. It’s just the prison outfit. They threw me in here too about an hour   ago. Fucking... dingleberries...                                                                    Orion: Damn, that sucks. Why though? Do they have special rules out here that I’m unaware of?       Jerry: I recognize that prepubescent voice... Oh god, please, no! Not this fool again!              Orion: You’re here?! Are you kidding me?! Just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse...          Jerry: What the hell are you doing here?                                                            Orion: I was out stretching my legs, taking a nice stroll along the aqueducts, then thought to      myself, “Man! In a city this nice, they probably have some beautiful looking jail cells too! Let’s  go take a look!” What do you think I'm doing here, bonehead?! They locked me up! Why are you here?  Jerry: I've been a regular on this server for years. This is where Dalia and I met! I was on duty   when the WRE took control of the city.                                                              Dalia: Quite a coincidence that all this happened on your watch. Did you fall asleep at your post?  Jerry: Never! But I probably could’ve saved the entire city if I wasn’t a measly level 3! I lost my entire inventory and all my levels thanks to somebody!                                              Orion: It wasn't my fault! A fucking ogre killed you while you were too busy bragging!              Jerry: I didn't see any ogre anywhere...                                                            Dalia: There definitely was an ogre, Jerry. I already told you, I saw it all happen.                Jerry: Hmm... Well, if my Lil’ Cuddlebug says it's true, then I believe her. But don't you dare try to make any moves on my Sweet Buttercup!                                                            Dalia: How many times do I have to tell you, we're not... *Sighs* Whatever, no matter what I say,   you’re too stubborn... So... yeah, the WRE locked us all in here too. *Clears throat* So... yeah,   the WRE locked us all in here too.                                                                  Orion: The WRE?                                                                                     Dalia: Western Roman Empire. We used to play alongside the Eastern Roman Empire, who’s the other    faction on this server. In the past, we've been involved in some struggles with them, so they don't exactly hold me in high regard. Between you and me though? WRE, ERE, whatever... same shit,         different name.                                                                                     Orion: Damn, so we're fucked. So where’s Nancy then? I thought she was tagging along with you.      Dalia: She was. At first, we were captured together, but then the guard took her somewhere else. Not sure where. Probably got put into a different cell, I’m guessing.                                  Orion: Oh shit, not the best experience to have on your first day in Eternum.                       Dalia: Yeah, definitely not the best. I'm sorry your visit here had to get cut short. And in like   the worst way, too.                                                                                 Orion: Don't worry, it's not your fault. What should we do now?                                     Dalia: *Stretching* Well, all we can do is wait. They took all my weapons so we’re kind of helpless here.                                                                                               Orion: *Sitting down* Can't we try to break down the door and escape?                               Dalia: Have you seen the heft of these doors? Unless you want to use that thick skull of yours and  mimic a charging rhinoceros, we aren’t going to have much luck.                                     Jerry: Well, if I still had my spells, we would’ve escaped a long time ago.                         Orion: Yeah, I witnessed how very useful your spells were in Ekabar...                              Jerry: That's because you distracted me.                                                            Orion: You distracted yourself.                                                                     Jerry: I could have defeated that monster easily.                                                   Orion: I did more work in that fight than you did, and I was only a level 1.                        Jerry: Oh please, I could snap you like a twig. You’re just lucky my Sugar Plum wants to keep you   alive, for some reason.                                                                             Orion: I didn’t know prison life turned people into such comedians! Let’s be real, I'm much stronger than you.                                                                                          Jerry: Bullshit. I'm stronger. And clever..er!                                                      Orion: Cleverer...? Now that's a good one! Next you’re gonna tell me you have better reflexes too?  Jerry: Oh that’s not even up for debate!                                                            Dalia: *Sighs* Can you two stop with all the, "No mine's bigger than yours"?                        Jerry: Well, now that you mention it my Sweet Shnookums, mine's definitely bigger...                Orion: You sure about that? It’s not because you have such tiny hands?                              Jerry: Alright that’s it, whip it out and we’ll measure!                                            Dalia: D-Don't do that! God! Would you two quit?!                                                   Jerry: Bah, this guy isn't worth my time anyways. I'll just spend time with my friend here. Maybe he knows something about respect.                                                                     Prisoner: Who are you?                                                                              Jerry: Sir Jermaine of Noriander. Future king of Eternum.                                           Prisoner: Okay...                                                                                   Jerry: Have I ever told you about the time I slayed a dragon with my bare hands?                    Prisoner: Um... no. This is the first time we’ve ever spoken.                                       Jerry: You see, I was looking for Dalia... the future mother of my offspring... on the Plains of    Denaria. We were just about to put her sweet, fertile body to good use, when I suddenly heard a loud roar...                                                                                            Dalia: . . .                                                                                        Orion: Aaaaanyways... what do you think they’re gonna do to us?                                     Dalia: They’ll probably use us as gladiators in the Rotunda’s Munus.                                Orion: G-Gladiators?                                                                                Dalia: Yeah. It's a tradition in the Western Roman Empire. When the Eastern faction took control of the city, they cancelled all the events in the Rotunda...                                           Orion: Ah, a more civilized Empire, I see!                                                          Dalia: ...and replaced them with public executions.                                                 Orion: Oh.                                                                                          Dalia: So now that the Western Empire is back in power, I guess they want to resume the exhibitions quickly. It does placate the masses, after all. A lot of players actually request to join the combat exhibitions, with most in search of fame and money. But the Empire throws a few prisoners in the   fights as well, so the veteran players can attain an easy victory.                                  Orion: If we win, what’s the reward?                                                                Dalia: Our freedom.                                                                                 Orion: Well, could be worse. I guess all we can do now is just wait until we’re summoned.           Dalia: Yep. Now we wait.                                                                            Orion: Now we wait...                                                                               Nancy: (Wow... Now that my dizziness has worn off, I’m realizing how astounding this world is! It’s absolutely magical...) How long do we have to be here, Maximo?                                      Maximo: Just a few more minutes, m'lady. The Emperor should be here any time now. Do you like the   dress?                                                                                              Nancy: Yes! It's so beautiful. And I love how they styled my hair!                                  Maximo: I'm glad to hear that. My wife's been the Empire's hairdresser for 3 years now.             Nancy: Well tell her she truly is a gifted woman!                                                   Maximo: Thank you, I will! She'll be so happy to hear that. We've been trying to... *Clears throat* On your feet, legionnaires! Behold! His excellency, Emperor Claudius III!                           Emperor Claudius III: Ahhh, yes... you weren't lying, Maximo! She is most definitely the one! No    doubt about it!                                                                                     Nancy: *Standing up* Hi! I'm Nancy, nice to meet you!                                               Emperor Claudius III: Uh... Maximo mentioned to me that it’s your first time in Eternum, so I’ll let this one slide. But next time, whenever I make an entrance, you must bow before me.                Nancy: Um... o-okay...                                                                              Emperor Claudius III: Is that your natural hair color?                                              Nancy: This again? Yeah, it is. Why is everyone here so interested in my hair?                      Emperor Claudius III: Because of the prophecy!                                                      Nancy: What prophecy?                                                                               Emperor Claudius III: The Prophecy of Tarraco! One year ago today, the Great Oracle of Bacchus      prophesied that a woman with fire-red hair and green eyes would lead the Empire to glory! She would be the direct descendent of Julius Caesar himself... ...And reunite all factions to restore the     greatness of Rome! With you here now, bearing the exact appearance that was foretold... you must be the fulfillment of the prophecy!                                                                    Nancy: Oh wow, little ‘ol me?! I’m honored! Does this mean I’ll have to assume power now, or...?    Emperor Claudius III: *Laughs* A woman? Emperor?! Hahaha! Nonsense. You shall become my concubine.  Nancy: But I thought the prophecy said I would lead–                                                Emperor Claudius III: The Great Oracle failed to mention that a man as powerful as me should remain at the helm, and only use the red-haired maiden to “provide relief” from the stress of ruling... But that’s okay! I went ahead and clarified that portion!                                              Nancy: What? How did you come to that conclusion?                                                   Emperor Claudius III: I’m pretty sure that’s what the Oracle meant... But let’s not linger on such  irrelevant details!                                                                                 Nancy: . . .                                                                                        Emperor Claudius III: Come on, let's go to the Rotunda. I've invited the leaders of the Senate and  prepared a few combat exhibitions to celebrate the conquest of the city.                            Nancy: Yeah, as nice as that sounds, I’d prefer to go and find my daughter.                         Emperor Claudius III: Your daughter? Where is she?                                                  Nancy: Your men arrested her and are probably holding her in prison!                                Emperor Claudius III: That's unacceptable! Maximo, retrieve my concubine’s daughter immediately!    Maximo: Yes, m'lord!                                                                                Nancy: Oh, well that was easy. But I'm not your concub–                                             Emperor Claudius III: Come with me, the Munus is about to begin. Your daughter will join us shortly.Nancy: Alright.                                                                                     Dalia: *Yawns*                                                                                      Orion: *Yawns* Now you're making me yawn too. *Sighs* I hope Nancy is okay...                       Dalia: Yeah, I hope so too...                                                                       Jerry: Zzzzz...                                                                                     Orion: Look, Jerry’s own story put him to sleep!                                                    Dalia: *Laughs* Yeah, looks like it! He can be annoying, but he's not a bad guy. He has a good      heart.                                                                                              Orion: I know. I’d never admit it to his face, but I think so too.                                  Dalia: Sometimes I wonder if I should give him a chance... *Standing up* Agggh... Maybe we should   start warming up. They're gonna call us to fight anytime now.                                       Orion: Are you worried about the match? I've seen how you fight. I’m pretty sure you’ll kick ass.   Dalia: Yeah, I mean I do train really hard to ensure I’m at the top of my fighting game... And I've seen some of their "professional" gladiators. Most of them shouldn't be a problem.                  Orion: Me, on the other hand...                                                                     Dalia: We've been training hard these past few weeks. I think you can win your match too. You're    good. And you learn fast. Just remember what I told you. You've been training hard these past few   weeks. I think you can win your match too. Maintain good posture, keep your core tight, and block or dodge as many strikes as you can. Wait for your opponent to leave an opening, and then hit them as hard as you can. And don’t forget to control your breathing!                                        Orion: Yeah, I remember, but it’s easier said than done... especially when you’re in the heat of the moment. Plus, I don't have the experience you do.                                                  Dalia: It just takes time. When I first started, I had no experience either! I’d never even held a  sword before. But I just stayed disciplined and trained every day for years. I even went to a       martial arts dojo in Kredon for a while to learn more advanced techniques.                          Orion: Do you always play in combat-oriented servers?                                               Dalia: Semper Invicta is actually one of the more quiet servers that I visit, even if that sounds   silly now given the current situation. This definitely isn’t the norm. But... yeah, I do prefer     servers with a lot of “action”. Except for The Cove, but that doesn't count.                        Orion: The Cove?                                                                                    Dalia: It's just a small server that has a cozy little beach. I go there whenever I want to relax... or to be alone. I'm the only one with access to it.                                                Orion: Really? And how’d you manage that?                                                           Dalia: It was an exclusive reward from a quest I completed some time ago. You need the password to  gain access to the server, and I'm the only one who knows it.                                       Orion: That's amazing! So, uhh... what’s the password?                                              Dalia: *Chuckles* Nice try.                                                                         Orion: Come on... I'm not gonna go there without asking for permission first. And I won't tell      anyone else. I promise!                                                                             Dalia: Um... Well, if I tell you... ...It’s because I’m trying to learn to trust you, alright? And  if you ever tell anyone, you're gonna lose my trust forever.                                        Orion: Of course. I wouldn’t betray you like that.                                                  Dalia: Hmm... Okay... the password is... "Stormblade".                                              Orion: Thank you, Dalia. (It's nice to see she’s beginning to trust me. I know she wouldn’t have    told this just to anyone. Stormblade... I have to remember that.) Your secret is safe with me.      Dalia: For your sake, it better be. I'm gonna kick your ass otherwise.                              Orion: Well, I'm gonna be much stronger than you in no time, so that’s not much of a threat...      Dalia: *Laughs* Oh, really? Weren’t you just crying about how scared you are about this Rotunda     match?!                                                                                             Orion: *Chuckles* Don't twist my words! I only said I happen to be lacking some experience in the   area of combat. In a few more weeks, you'll be no match for me.                                     Dalia: *Chuckles* You're pretty cocky for a guy that’s never won a single sparring match against me.Orion: But I'm getting close! I just need some more time.                                           Dalia: In your dreams, noodle arms! You're never gonna beat me.                                     Orion: Oh, you wanna bet?                                                                           Dalia: Hah! Sure, whatever you want. If after two weeks you still can’t beat me in a fight, you'll  have to do all my chores for an entire month.                                                       Orion: Alright. And if I beat you?                                                                  Dalia: I’ll do anything you want. I mean, you’re not gonna win, so it doesn’t even matter.          Orion: Hmmm... anything I want?                                                                     Dalia: Anything...                                                                                  Orion: Like, anything anything?                                                                     Dalia: A-n-y-t-h-i-n-g. I couldn't care less.                                                       Orion: (Am I imagining things, or is she being kinda... "flirty"?)                                  Ask for something spicy                                                                             Orion: Well... If that's the case... Remember the other day when you told me you don’t have a gag   reflex? While we were in the kitchen?                                                               Dalia: Uh, yeah...?                                                                                 Orion: Well... how do I put this politely... I'd really like to... test out... whether you’re lying or not...                                                                                           Dalia: Um... Wait, w-what...?! S-Seriously? You're a fucking pig!                                   Orion: Oh come on! You totally were hinting at something naughty! *Imitating Dalia with a flirty    voice* I’ll do aaaaanything you want...                                                             Dalia: B-But, I thought you'd ask me to flash my tits again, or do a striptease, o-or something!    B-But, I thought you'd ask me to flash my tits or something!                                        Orion: Oh damn, so you'd do all that too?!                                                          Dalia: O-Of course not! I’d only agree to that in the first place because you’ll never beat me in a fight! Like, ever!                                                                                  Orion: Well if that’s the case, then why does it matter what I want? Getting naked, testing out     your... “skills”, or any other thing. You’re so positive you’re gonna win anyways!                  Dalia: . . . I guess you’re right. Fine then, you have a deal. You’re still a pig though. I want you to “oink” too while you’re doing all of my chores, alright? All month long!                        Orion: *Chuckles* So, have we reached an agreement then?                                            Dalia: Yeah, whatever.                                                                              Orion: I need to make sure things are crystal clear, though. Dalia, oh Dalia, what are you gonna do if I win?                                                                                           Dalia: Don’t count your eggs before they hatch, Orion. You have no chance.                          Orion: Still, a bet is a bet. I need you to say it out loud.                                        Dalia: . . . If the world turns upside down, and you somehow manage to beat me in a fight within the next 2 weeks... I'll suck your cock. Happy?                                                        Orion: *Chuckles* Yeah. With what I’m asking, you sure you don’t want to raise the stakes on my end?Dalia: No, thanks. Doing my chores sounds good enough.                                              Orion: As you wish.                                                                                 Don't ask for anything in return                                                                    Orion: Meh. The pure satisfaction from defeating you would be more than enough. I don't need        anything else from you.                                                                             Dalia: *Puffing* Huh, as you wish. Not like it matters. Get your French maid outfit ready, because  you’ll be doing my chores soon! Nope. Stop insisting.                                               Orion: (Oh shit.)                                                                                   Maximo: The Rotunda awaits. You will fight for your freedom against the Empire’s champions. Lady    Dalia, however... you are exempt. Legionnaire Pullo will escort you to the rostrum.                 Dalia: What? Me? I don't have to fight?!                                                            Maximo: That's correct.                                                                             Dalia: Nice! But... Why?                                                                            Maximo: Orders of the Emperor.                                                                      Dalia: Well what about them? Do they still have to fight?                                           Maximo: I’ve only been instructed to retrieve you, so yes, they will still be sent to the Rotunda.  Pullo, please escort her.                                                                           Legionnaire: Let's go, Lady Dalia.                                                                  Dalia: What? No! If he can't come with me, I’d rather just stay!                                    Jerry: Don't worry, my Yummy Bear, I'll be alright! I’ll fight in honor of you!                     Orion: She's pointing to me!                                                                        Jerry: Don't be jealous!                                                                            Legionnaire: I'm sorry, these orders are straight from the Emperor himself.                         Maximo: You three will be provided with Legionnaire armor and–                                      Jerry: You know, now that you mention your "Legionnaire" armor... what’s going on with them? I know you guys are dedicated to your roleplaying, but at least be historically accurate with your         equipment! I mean, they look more Greek to me than Roman. Like Spartan armor, I'd say. I mean for   fuck’s sake, did you guys even take history in school?                                              Maximo: . . . You three will be provided with Legion–                                               Jerry: And what's with the uncovered chest?? According to historians, that's a myth which originated in...                                                                                              Maximo: You... two... will be provided with Legionnaire armor and weapons. It will be a battle to   the death. If you win, you will be granted your freedom. Otherwise, the afterlife awaits. Now go    gear up and await further instructions. Any questions?                                              Orion: N-No. All clear.                                                                             Maximo: Death or Glory.                                                                             Orion: D-Death or G-Glory.                                                                          Crowd: *Talking loudly*                                                                             Emperor Claudius III: Ah, Bodenius the Architect! Glad you could make it.                           Bodenius the Architect: Always a pleasure to see you, my Emperor. I never had a doubt that it would be the WRE to lead the unification of Rome! And this must be the woman of whom the prophecy spoke!  The fire-haired maiden!                                                                             Nancy: Well, I don’t know about all that prophecy stuff, but... I'm Nancy! It’s a pleasure meeting  you! An architect, hm? Were you the designer of all the city buildings?                             Bodenius the Architect: Not all of them, because the city has been under ERE rule for quite some    time, but I did design this Rotunda a few years ago.                                                Nancy: That's amazing! It truly is stunning!                                                        Bodenius the Architect: Thank you so much, m'lady.                                                  Emperor Claudius III: With this woman under my control, I'll finally be able to conquer the entire  server. I'll become a God!                                                                          Bodenius the Architect: I have no doubt, m'lord...                                                  Nancy: Hmm? Dalia! I'm here!                                                                        Dalia: Huh? Hi Mom! Sorry about all this craziness! I’m glad to see you’re okay! What are you doing next to the Emperor? And what are you wearing?                                                      Nancy: *Laughs* It's a long story! Come over here and I’ll fill you in!                             Dalia: Sure! I’ll be right ov–                                                                      Legionnaire: I'm sorry Dalia, but I’m afraid I cannot let you pass.                                 Dalia: What?! Why? I'm no longer a prisoner! Talk to Maximo, he’ll tell ya!                         Legionnaire: I understand, but the Emperor has explicitly stated that only members of his private   entourage may enter the gallery. You know how it is... I’m just following the rules here...         Dalia: And this guy sure does have a lot of them. Who put him in charge?                            Legionnaire: I don't know, I've only been here a few months.                                        Dalia: Bah, whatever. I'll just wait until after the exhibitions are done then.                     Legionnaire: Enjoy the Munus!                                                                       Dalia: Thanks...                                                                                    Emperor Claudius III: Ladies and gentlemen... The Rotunda Munera have finally returned!             Crowd: *Cheers*                                                                                     Emperor Claudius III: The ERE’s age of terror has finally met its end. A new era begins under the   command of the Western Empire! Have faith in me, my dear people, FOR I WILL LEAD YOU TO GLORY! To   the gladiators that await below... Your Claudius the Great... Claudius the Magnificent... Claudius  the Godsend... Has words for you... WHAT YOU DO IN THIS LIFE... ECHOES IN ETERNUM!!                 Crowd: *Cheers*                                                                                     Emperor Claudius III: Now let the fights BEGIN!                                                     Titus: Hehehe... So you’re up against me, eh? You have zero chance! Zero!                           Dalia: What? Who are you?                                                                           Titus: I'm surprised you don't know me. I'm Titus Dubitatius, esteemed trainer of Jasticus the      Decapitator... gladiator of today’s finale match. I just assumed you were a trainer too.            Dalia: Oh... I see. I'm not a... Well, now that you mention it... I guess I have been Orion’s       trainer in a certain sense... So yes! I am indeed a Gladiator trainer as well.                      Titus: Orion? *Laughs* My boy is gonna destroy yours. Jasticus is still undefeated after 13 fights. Yours?                                                                                              Dalia: Um... well, Alex told me that Thanatos still managed to kick Orion’s ass, even while missing a hand... So my fighter is 0 for 1, I guess.                                                        Titus: Beaten by a Thanatos impersonator? Pathetic.                                                 Dalia: She said it was the real Tha–                                                                Titus: I bet you 50 eternals my boy kills yours in less than 20 seconds.                            Dalia: Hey, hey, hold your horses there, tubby. Orion doesn't have much experience, but he knows how to fight. I'm sure he’ll have no problem defeating your guy.                                       Titus: *Laughs* Overconfidence and naivety... music to my ears. Let’s make it 100 eternals then!    Dalia: DONE DEAL!                                                                                   Titus: Now I’ll get to buy 100 apples from that guy near the market!                                Dalia: Don’t let your mouth start watering just yet... Oh... I see. I'm not a trainer, sorry. I know one of the fighters, though.                                                                       Titus: My boy Jasticus is gonna destroy him. You ready to witness the devastation?!                 Dalia: Yeah... that's quite possible, not gonna lie. Let's see how this plays out.                  Crowd: *Cheers*                                                                                     Emperor Claudius III: And the Champion of Sicily defeats his opponent with ease! Guards, clean up   all those guts before the next match! That ERE bastard was quite the squirter...                    Orion: (Oh god, that didn't sound too good... Wasn’t that the guy who said he was a combat veteran? He didn't even last an entire minute... Okay, calm down, Orion. I need to keep it together.)        Legionnaire: Sir! You are up! Proceed to the arena!                                                 Orion: Oh shit, already?                                                                            Legionnaire: Yes!                                                                                   Orion: O-Okay... (Oh god, there's a lot of people up there watching... Keep it cool, Orion...       Remember your training, you can do this...)                                                         Emperor Claudius III: And finally, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the finale! For this match, we have... Esteemed warrior and merciless fighter... JASTICUS THE DECAPITATOR!!!                   Crowd: *Cheers enthusiastically*                                                                    Emperor Claudius III: Against an accused traitor of the Empire and foreigner to these lands...      Orion, the... *checks his level* ...RELATIVELY AVERAGE ETERNUM PLAYER!!                             Crowd: *A couple of people timidly applaud*                                                         Nancy: Oh it’s Orion! He finally logged in! I didn't know he liked to play as a gladiator! Maybe    next time we hit the gym together, we’ll do some kickboxing instead of yoga! Wow... that armor      really complements his nice physique...                                                             Dalia: Don't worry Orion! Stay calm! Remember, even one second can alter the direction of a fight!  It could mean life or death!                                                                        Titus: *Laughs* I thought there was a minimum age for Eternum? Your gladiator looks like a baby next to my Jasticus.                                                                                    Dalia: Shut the fuck up. The bigger they are, the harder they fall.                                 Titus: I almost feel sorry for what your boy has got coming to him... damn, I should have bet more. *Laughs* Better start looking for a new line of work. I doubt anyone will hire you as their trainer after this shit show. You know, I could use someone tall to help me grab things from higher shelv–  Dalia: I said SHUT THE FUCK UP!                                                                     Orion: (What the hell?! This guy is massive! What am I supposed to do now? I could try to activate  my powers, but that’s gonna require time and full concentration before I’d be ready! And even if I  can activate them, I’ll probably lose control like always and get my face smashed in!)              Dalia: Use the sword, Orion! It'll give you better mobility!                                        Jasticus the decapitator: They won’t be able to scrub out your blood from the Rotunda floors after  I’m done with you!                                                                                  Orion: (Okay, I need a second. Remember your training. You're powerful... Dalia said it herself.    You’ve faced greater odds before... you can do this. Remember your training. You're powerful. You’ve faced greater odds before... you can do this.)                                                     Emperor Claudius III: Let the battle BEGIN!                                                         Jasticus the decapitator: COME HERE BOY!!                                                           Orion: (This is it. It’s now or never. Breathe throughout each strike. Maintain a good rhythm.)     Jasticus the decapitator: I don’t think you’ve met my lance before! Since our time here is going to be pretty short...                                                                                  Dalia: Orion!! Keep your eyes open!

Jasticus the decapitator: Why don’t I... INTRODUCE YOU TWO?! Why don’t I... INTRODUCE YOU TWO?!     Titus: *Laughs*                                                                                     Dalia: Um... Can I bet on your guy too?                                                             Jasticus the decapitator: DIE!!! What the... how the hell did you move so fast...                   Orion: *Taking a deep breath* (I can see it all... I can hear everything... But this time... feels  different... Now I’m the one in control.)                                                           Jasticus the decapitator: Trying out some scare tactics? You think I’m afraid of you?!              Orion: (One second can mean the difference between life and death. In Eternum... you’ve only got... one chance.)                                                                                        Dalia: AAAAAAH! THAT'S MY STANCE!! He's using the stance I taught him!                              Titus: What the hell? Magic is disabled on this server. What’s happening?!                          Orion: (Seize the opportunity you’ve been given. One opening.) F-Fuck...                            Crowd: KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL!                                                                Orion: (Agh... It h-hurts... I c-can’t... can’t feel... my...)                                      Jasticus the decapitator: I'm sorry, kid. It's nothing personal. I admire your bravery.             Orion: N-No... W-Wait... I can still... I can...                                                    .  .  .  .  .                                                                                       Orion: *Removing your visor* FUCK! (Damn it! What a waste... I know I wasn’t high leveled, but this still sucks. Now I know how Jerry must have felt... Jesus, that was quite the shock. I can almost   still feel the bleeding sensation... man, that was horrible. Well, at least Nancy and Penelope have been faring well in Eternum. Better than me, apparently... Still. I can’t give up. I’m going to give Chang a call so we can start the heist preparations. Everything has to be perfect... I don't wanna die again. No mistakes this time, Orion.) LET'S DO IT! (One chance.)                                Crowd: *Cheers*                                                                                     Dalia: AAAAAAAAAAARGHHH! HE WON!!! HE FUCKING DID IT!!                                              Titus: What...?

Dalia: I'm sorry, what were you saying? Guess you better start hunting for a new line of work,      pal...                                                                                              Titus: Grrr... he cheated! How the hell did he activate magic when it’s blocked server-wide?!       Dalia: I’m hearing a whole lot of excuses, but what I really need to be hearing is the sound of your eternals being transferred to my account.                                                          Titus: F-Fine, fine! You won... Dammit.                                                             Dalia: *Giggles* If you ever need to offload some more eternals, I’ll be around!                    Nancy: Wow... did you see that? He was... unbelievable! I never knew Orion could do stuff like that!Emperor Claudius III: Huh... not bad. For a lower level.                                            Orion: *Dropping your sword* (God, I'm exhausted... I feel like I just got run over by a car.)      Jasticus the decapitator: *Groaning* Arghhhh... W-Well... f-fought...                               Crowd: KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL!    Finish him off                                                                                      Nancy: Ugh... That was... brutal...

Spare his life                                                                                      Jasticus the decapitator: W-What...? You're... you’re sparing me?                                   Orion: Yes. You fought well, my friend. I have no qualms with you.                                  Jasticus the decapitator: . . . Thank you...                                                        Player: Orion the Merciful!!!

Emperor Claudius III: What?! How dare he disobey an order of the Emperor! Unbelievable! Guards!     Apprehend that traitor and hang him immediately!                                                    Nancy: What! Oh I don’t think so... Guards, keep your hands off of him! He’s earned his freedom!    Emperor Claudius III: Silence, woman! You're merely a concubine of the Emperor, and as such, you are to keep your whorish trap shut!                                                                    Nancy: You know, I’ve been going along with all the roleplay around here because I think it’s pretty fun, but your attitude is really starting to make my blood boil. I don’t care what misinterpreted  prophecy you’re trying to follow, but I will NEVER be your concubine. In fact, I refuse to be       ANYTHING that requires me ANYWHERE near you! You disgust me!                                        Emperor Claudius III: I SAID SILENCE, YOU VILE HARLOT! HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO YOUR EMPEROR IN THAT   WAY!                                                                                                Nancy: Jesus, shut the fuck up already with all your Emperor nonsense!                              Emperor Claudius III: Why you insolent little... AAargh... *Collapses*                              Player: Oh my god! She killed the Emperor!                                                          Nancy: I d-didn’t kill him! I j-just... decked him... a little...                                   Player: She knocked out the Emperor!                                                                Nancy: H-He hit me first! I just...                                                                 Legionnaire: Get her!                                                                               Maximo: Halt! Lady Nancy has just defeated Emperor Claudius in single combat.                       Nancy: I have?                                                                                      Maximo: According to the sacred Civil Laws of Rome, any person who defeats the reigning monarch is  therefore granted the throne. Hence, on this day, the Western Roman Empire has hereby gained a new  Emperor!

Maximo: *Whispering* Claudius was a tyrant and an incompetent military leader. *Whispering* And you treated me better today than he has in the last three years. *Whispering* So just follow my lead.   Nancy: *Whispering* Um... but I'm not exactly an expert in politics... and I’m especially not       qualified to lead an entire empire!                                                                 Maximo: *Whispering* Look, all I’m asking for is to switch my work hours this Friday. *Whispering* I have to pick up my kids from school in the real world, but Claudius said I’m not allowed to change my schedule here.                                                                                   Nancy: That's ridiculous. Family always comes first. Of course you can change it!                   Maximo: EMPEROR CLAUDIUS IS DEAD! LONG LIVE THE EMPRESS!                                            Crowd: *Cheers*                                                                                     Dalia: Um... Mom?

Nancy: *Laughs* I have no idea, to be honest. Looks like I'm the Empress now, or something.         Dalia: Only you could pull off something like this during your first day! How did you do it?        Nancy: It's a long story... why don’t you come with me and I’ll explain it to you! Maximo showed me the Emperor’s private rooms earlier. They're glorious!                                              Dalia: I would, but I have to log off now. Gotta catch the national weightlifting competition on TV! It started a few minutes ago. Tell me everything during dinner, alright?!                          Nancy: Oh, I will!                                                                                  Dalia: Follow me. Let's grab Orion and find an Exit Portal!                                         Nancy: Aw, but there’s still around 15 minutes before dinner time! I can’t just leave my new Empire hanging like this... You go ahead! I’ll see you in a bit!                                           Dalia: Well, well, well... now look who’s becoming the addicted gamer?!                             Nancy: *Giggles* I'll admit, this is way better than I thought. Guess I won’t scold you anymore for playing hours on end. I get it now!                                                                 Dalia: I'll remember that! Alright then, I'm leaving. See you later... Empress!                     Nancy: I'll see you at dinner, sweetheart. (I haven’t had this much fun in years! Now I understand  what all the hype is about!)                                                                        Maximo: My Empress, what do you want to do with the Champions of the Rotunda?                       Nancy: Oh yes, tell them the celebratory banquet will be held tomorrow, so they are free to go home and rest. As for Orion... . . . Tell him to go to the Royal Chambers. Have the servants prepare the pool.                                                                                               Maximo: Right away, my Empress!                                                                     Jasticus the decapitator: I've never seen anyone move so fast! How long have you been playing       Eternum?                                                                                            Orion: Only a few weeks.                                                                            Jasticus the decapitator: Wow, you must be a natural. I wish I had your skills! Well, thanks again  for not killing me, buddy. I gotta go now. I have to work early tomorrow morning.                   Orion: Oh, you have a job in the real world too?                                                    Jasticus the decapitator: Of course, only the best gladiators in Eternum can afford to go full-time. I work as a Pharmacy Operations Specialist for a retail chain.                                     Orion: Oh... wow. That's totally not what I was expecting.                                          Jasticus the decapitator: Yeah I get that a lot. I’m just an average Joe that seeks a little escape from reality like any other player. I just happen to be a fan of the occasional decapitation here   and there. What can I say? It’s my guilty pleasure.                                                 Orion: F-Fair enough. Take care, man!                                                               Jasticus the decapitator: You too!                                                                  Orion: (Well, I guess it's time to leave. I hope Dalia saw the entire match. I know she’d be proud!)Maximo: Orion!                                                                                      Orion: *Turning around* Oh god, please, no! I don’t wanna go back to that cell, please!             Maximo: No, no, my friend... quite the opposite. You are free to go. Before you go though, I just   wanted to apologize to you. I’m only doing what I’m told, y’know. Oh, and also, you’ve been invited to the Emperor’s Royal Chambers.                                                                    Orion: Me? I wasn't expecting that. Well thank you, Maximo. And apology accepted! Do you know what  the Emperor wants? I really should be going back home... it’s probably close to dinner time.        Maximo: I only know that you’ve been given an exclusive invitation to the Royal Bath, as a reward   for your victory.                                                                                   Accept the invitation                                                                               Orion: Hmmm... alright, I accept the invitation.                                                    Maximo: Excellent. Take the private exit off to the side and then you’ll find the Royal Bath at the top of the stairs. I’ll inform the guards to let you pass.                                          Orion: Very well. Thank you, Maximo.                                                                Maximo: Enjoy! Today you are the victor! Death or Glory!                                            Don't accept it and go back home                                                                    Orion: I appreciate it, but after that intense fight, I’m pretty drained. Maybe another day. Please tell him I'm honored and truly grateful for his generous offer of hospitality.                      Maximo: Alright. Thank you, Orion. And good luck.                                                   Orion: Good luck to you too! (Ahh... an exit portal, thank god. I’m starting to ache all over...    I’ve earned my fucking shower tonight. What an eventful day...) *Removing your visor* Phew... (I    can't believe all that happened in just one day.) *Looking at your phone* (It's quite late... I     still have to call Chang so we can start the heist preparations. If something goes wrong, we could  be captured, killed, or even... excommunicated. No. Power of positive thinking, Orion. We're gonna  develop the perfect plan, steal that Gem of Doom, get invited to that big shot dinner, and then     we'll gather valuable information about Ulysses... (...Or at least the whereabouts of the other     Gems. Penelope and Nancy seem to be catching onto Eternum pretty quickly. I’d say we have a very    strong and well-balanced team with them on board.) LET’S MAKE IT HAPPEN! (Wow, this place is        something else... Candle lighting and soothing fragrances... they really pulled off the relaxing    ambience quite well.) *Sitting down* (This pool sure looks enticing... The physical toll of that    fight is starting to catch up to me. I’m sure that warm water would do me some good...) Hmm? Nancy! There you are!                                                                                      Nancy: Hello, dear Champion.                                                                        Orion: I was worried something bad happened to you. Did they imprison you as well? If so, you       definitely were issued some fancy prison attire...                                                  Nancy: *Chuckles* I’m glad you were thinking about me. No, I wasn’t imprisoned... quite the         opposite, really. It’s a long story, but... somehow this girl has found herself as the Empress.     Orion: *Chuckles* What? Are you serious?! You are the Empress?                                      Nancy: *Giggles* Apparently! The former ruler had an... accident... and I was chosen to be the      successor.                                                                                          Orion: Wow. I have so many questions. My apologies, your highness! I should be bowing right now!    Nancy: *Laughs* Oh, don’t you dare! You’re too much! I'll tell you the full story later. I know     Dalia wants to hear it too. She had some wrestling to watch so she logged off earlier. You know how she is with her TV shows!                                                                           Orion: That I do! She almost killed me the other day when I accidentally sat on the remote and      changed the channel.                                                                                Nancy: *Giggles* That’s my daughter alright! Well, enough about her. I want to hear more from my    esteemed Champion. Did you know this Royal Bathhouse is open only to the Emperor and the Emperor’s  special guests?                                                                                     Orion: I had no idea! I feel so honored now. Does that make me your special guest?                  Nancy: Indeed... I don’t see anyone else around here... Would you like to take a bath? You must be  exhausted after such an intense fight.                                                              Orion: Honestly, I was thinking about it before you came in. The water looks pretty tempting...     Nancy: Well you know, Orion... Sometimes it’s good to give into temptation... *Unties her robes and drops them slowly to the ground* You’ll find it can be... quite satisfying...                       Orion: *Gulps* Y-Yeah... d-definitely...                                                            Nancy: I hope you don't mind me joining you.                                                        Orion: N-Not at all...                                                                              Nancy: I’ve had quite a day as well, and have been dying to get a little more... Comfortable...     Orion: N-Nancy... You...                                                                            Nancy: *Giggles* Is that nervousness I sense in your voice, Orion? Mmm... I don’t see this side of  you very often...                                                                                   Orion: I... I just wasn’t expecting this... Sorry, I didn’t mean to stare. I’ll give you some priv– Nancy: Shh. I want your eyes on me. You know it’d be quite rude to look away from  your Empress.    *Giggles* And don’t act like we haven’t seen each other naked before... We bathed together countless times when you were younger, remember? Your father left for business trips frequently so you stayed over all the time.                                                                                 Orion: (My god... I can't believe I'm actually getting to see her like this...) Well, that's        different. I was, what, like... 5 years old? And I don’t remember much from back then.              Nancy: Yeah, those were definitely some difficult times. Looking back on it now, we sure have come a long way. We’re quite lucky. Time sure does fly by... Let’s not dwell on the past though. I’m      grateful for it, but I’d much rather focus on the present. All the good things... and people... that it’s given to us. Now, if you don’t mind, I’ve been dying to try out this pool... We can’t let it  go to waste now, can we?                                                                            Orion: Definitely not...                                                                            Nancy: Mmm... the water is quite hot, but not enough to make it uncomfortable. It's just right...   From what I’ve been told, the former Emperor was quite worthless for most things, but he knew what  he was doing with this bathhouse. I'll give him that. The decor, the water, the pool... it’s all    perfect. But you know... there’s still one thing missing...                                         Orion: What might that be?                                                                          Nancy: You, my Champion. Will you be joining me, or do you have to get going?                       Orion: (Maybe I’m just fatigued from the fight... but Nancy seems to be really flirtatious right    now. I’ve never seen this side of her before. I don’t know how to take all this...)                 Nancy: Orion?                                                                                       Orion: Oh, sorry, yes! I will d-definitely be joining you... Dear lord... Ehem, I mean... dear lord, you were right! This water feels perfect. (Nancy's body is completely mesmerizing. I feel like I'm taking a bath with a Roman Goddess. I can’t keep my eyes off of her... And... wooooop, there it is. Definitely getting a hard-on. Keep it together! She’s been like a mother to you. Focus, Orion! This is strictly a bath!) So... how has Eternum been so far? First impressions?                          Nancy: Eternum! I totally forgot we were even playing a game. I just got so caught up. *Giggles* For a second there, I thought these really were the Roman times...                                     Orion: *Chuckles* Yeah, I get lost in the moment a lot too.                                         Nancy: It’s even better than what people say, to be honest. How can it feel so real? How could a    little computer chip on the back of your head do all this? I mean, it’s unbelievable! I can         literally see my own reflection in the pool... hear the crackling of the fire as the candles burn... smell the aromas of the exotic incense... And feel my body! Each and every inch of it feels exactly how it is in the real world!                                                                       Orion: *Gulps*                                                                                      Nancy: Every last detail of my being has been perfectly recreated... And not only that, I react to  each sensation in the same way too!                                                                 Orion: Yeah...                                                                                      Nancy: It almost feels like... magic.                                                               Orion: I've been playing for some time now, and I still can't comprehend how all of this is         possible. And there's no use in trying to understand it either. I read somewhere that it's due to   the E-suit and the neural implant. They say the combination of the two allows for the reading of    your genome. There were a lot more technical details and scientific explanations, but it all kind of went over my head. So yeah, let’s just say it’s magic. Pure magic. I mean, earlier I was playing   with Penelope and we were able to revisit one of her memories in great detail! Can you believe it?  An actual memory from years past! And I saw you! Back when you were my babysitter. I was too young  to remember most of that time, but you looked exactly like you did in our old pictures!             Nancy: Oh my... I gotta try that. What I’d give to be young again... It must feel nice.             Orion: You should try other servers next time. They're all spectacular.                             Nancy: Well, some of them must be designed for the younger crowd. So consider me excluded already.  Orion: Are you kidding me? If I were to ask anyone around, I bet I couldn’t find a single person    who’d think you were older than 30. Most would assume you were in your mid-20s!                     Nancy: *Giggles* You’re sweet, Orion. I guess I did get a little lucky in the genetics department... I owe it to my mother. It seems like once she reached 25, she stopped aging. She died shortly after Dalia was born, but she was always so full of life.                                                Orion: The apple certainly doesn’t fall far from the tree, Nancy. Dalia and Penelope are gonna be   very blessed when they get older too.                                                               Nancy: Alright, so riddle me this. If we went to a restaurant, with just the two of us... would the waiter refer to me as your “girlfriend” or as your “mother”?                                        Orion: Girlfriend. No doubt about it at all. We can prove my point by going out to dinner together, if you want.                                                                                        Nancy: *Giggles* Now, now... I wouldn’t want to make your real girlfriend jealous.                  Orion: Well, you’re in luck – she doesn’t exist.                                                    Nancy: Really? No European model anxiously awaiting your return? What about Kredon? Have you met    anyone special yet?                                                                                 Orion: I've met a lot of special people, but... not in that way.                                    Nancy: Interesting. Okay. Well I have another question for you, Mr. Lone Stallion. And let me know  if I’m being too intrusive...                                                                       Orion: Not at all. Fire away, my Empress.                                                           Nancy: Have you ever... been with a girl?                                                           Orion: Mmm, yes... I have. A couple of times.                                                       Nancy: I see... my young Orion has a little experience under his belt. Very interesting... Do I know them?                                                                                              Orion: *Chuckles* It’d be pretty surprising if you did.                                             Nancy: Alright... are you trying to pursue anything more serious with any of them?                  Orion: I have... once.                                                                              Nancy: Do I know her?                                                                               Orion: *Chuckles* It’d be pretty surprising if you did.                                             Nancy: And... are you planning to pursue anything more serious with her?                            Orion: I haven't. Well, not to... completion, if you know what I mean.                              Nancy: I see... And... are you planning to pursue anything more serious with any of those ladies?   Orion: As of right now, no. I’m kind of just taking things one day at a time. Who knows what could  happen.                                                                                             Nancy: Hmm... What about Dalia and Penelope?                                                        Orion: What about them?                                                                             Nancy: Well... they're single too.                                                                  Orion: Um... I... I'm not... I mean... I'd never dare.                                              Nancy: Why not? I wouldn’t mind having you as my son-in-law...                                      Orion: Well, um...                                                                                  Nancy: Let’s say one of my daughters came in here right now and asked you to have sex with them. No tricks or schemes... they just desired you. Would you say yes?                                      Yes                                                                                                 Orion: I’m going to be totally frank with you here, so don’t get mad at me. I'd be lying if I said  that doesn’t sound like a dream come true.                                                          Nancy: *Giggles* Just as I thought. I appreciate your honesty. As a mother, I've always feared the  day that my daughters would bring a boy home for dinner. Not because I don’t want them to find      someone, but rather, whether that person would be good enough for them.                             Orion: *Chuckles* Is someone hinting that I might be good enough...?                                Nancy: *Giggles* I'm not sure yet. You definitely have most of the desirable qualities in a man, but still... there’s some areas of you I don’t know much about. As a mother, I need to make sure that  you’re a good candidate in... all... areas.                                                         Orion: All areas, huh? How will you determine that?                                                 Nancy: Well, I'm in the process of determining it right now. I've been analyzing you throughout this entire conversation.                                                                               Orion: *Chuckles* Oh... and here I thought you just enjoyed spending time with me.                  No                                                                                                  Orion: I couldn't. I don't know... I just see them as family.                                       Nancy: Ah, I see. I guess it does make sense. Well, there goes my plan to determine whether you’d be a good candidate or not.                                                                           Orion: *Chuckles* A plan? I thought you just enjoyed spending time with me.                         Nancy: I do! One thing does not exclude the other... Well, you’ve been quite transparent with me so far. I think it’s only right that I be honest with you as well. I’m going to confess something to   you, Orion...                                                                                       Orion: Alright...                                                                                   Nancy: It might sound silly, but... the whole reason why I bought the Eternum implant... was to     spend more time with you. You just... You make me feel so young again. Your energy is infectious.   Your charm is invigorating. When I’m with you, I feel like I can take on the world. And then you    awaken so many other feelings within me that I thought were long gone...                            Orion: Wow... I had no idea, Nancy. I don’t even know what to say.                                  Nancy: Ahh, I’m sorry. You don’t have to say anything... I’ve probably said too much myself.        Orion: No, really Nancy... it honestly feels so nice to hear that coming from you. I consider you to be someone very important in my life, so it’s truly appreciated.                                   Nancy: Thank you, Orion. I felt like I might’ve been blabbering on and on... Well, are you enjoying this time with your Empress?                                                                        Orion: *Chuckles* Very much. I’m honored to be your special guest... and feel so privileged to      witness such a rare and honestly breathtaking sight.                                                Nancy: You're sweet. I’m glad the Royal Baths are to your liking. But I must confess, I think I’ve  also found something to my liking... *Starts rubbing her foot against your dick* Is that because of me...?                                                                                              Orion: I'm sorry, I couldn't help it...                                                             Nancy: Hmph. I invite a commoner to my private baths and he can’t even contain himself. What a      shame.                                                                                              Orion: I'm sorry, my Empress... how can I make it up to you?                                        Nancy: *Giggles* Well, it’s almost dinner time, so we should probably get going now. But before     that, you can show your remorse by bringing me a glass of wine from the table... And then I might   forget this all happened.                                                                           Orion: Your wish is my command...                                                                   Nancy: Oh my...                                                                                     Orion: I'll be right back.                                                                          Nancy: Umm... a-alright... I'll start getting dressed then... Hmph. I should have removed my        underwear before I bathed. Now they’re soaking wet. I guess I’ll have to go around without them...  Orion: (My God... her curves are mind-blowing. She’s driving me insane.)                            Nancy: *Removing her underwear* I guess now we have to find one of those... "Exit Portals", right?  Orion: (With her getting nude in front of me... her flirtatious mannerisms... and all the lingering stares at my body...)                                                                               Nancy: Oh, before I forget...                                                                       Orion: (I’d hate myself if I didn’t at least try...)                                                Nancy: I think this goes without saying, but let’s not mention this to anyone. My daughters         especially... heavens knows what they’d think if they learned we bathed together. They'd probably   end up– Orion?                                                                                      Orion: I couldn't find the wine, my Empress, but I believe I’ve come up with a better way to serve  you... if you so desire...                                                                          Nancy: Oh, really...? Please enlighten me...                                                        Orion: Well, I thought we could make your first day on Eternum much more... memorable.              Nancy: Memorable, you say? Well I’m already having a difficult time not thinking about just how hard you feel pressed against me...                                                                     Orion: My only wish is to serve my Empress. *Kissing her neck*                                      Nancy: Oh, Orion... W-What are you doing...                                                         Orion: If you want me to stop, please–                                                              Nancy: Don’t you dare.                                                                              Orion: *Giving her a hickey*                                                                        Nancy: *Whispers* Mmmm...                                                                           Orion: (Finally I get to feel Nancy’s breasts filling my hands... they’re so much bigger than I     thought... I can even feel her heart beating so quickly... she seems nervous, yet so excited at the same time... I can tell she was looking forward to this.) God... I can’t keep my hands off of you.  Every inch of you is just so... unreal! Have you always had such amazing breasts?                   Nancy: *Giggles* Since I was 17.                                                                    Orion: I guess I never paid attention back then, since I was only five and had no interest in       them...                                                                                             Nancy: *Giggles* Well I’m so glad you’re paying attention to them now... Oh Orion... how you’ve     grown into such a strong, handsome man... After having taken care of you for so long back then... I never thought we’d be in this position now...                                                       Orion: Does that mean you won’t take care of me anymore then?                                       Nancy: Oh, I will. Just... in another way. Ohh... Oh, my boy...                                     Orion: *Sucking and licking her nipples* (I can feel her breath spike with every dash of my tongue  against her nipples... I love how hard they are...)                                                 Nancy: Ahh... You have no idea how much I’ve fantasized about this moment, Orion...                 Orion: (She feels so warm... her skin is so soft and smooth...)                                     Nancy: Ahhhhh... *Coming out of the water* Alright... I can’t hold back anymore. Does the Champion  truly want to serve his Empress?                                                                    Orion: More than anything in this world.                                                            Nancy: You know... I remember from my history classes that it was always taboo for royalty to       intermingle with common folk... But I think we’ve broken enough rules today... I need to feel my    Champion... taste the forbidden fruit...                                                            Orion: You're... Perfect... I can’t hold back any longer... I want you so bad, Nancy...             Nancy: AAaaaahh... Just like that... Ahhh... Yeah...                                                Orion: (I’ve barely even started and Nancy’s juices are already covering my face... She really has  been waiting for me...)                                                                             Nancy: Y-You... you really do know... Ah! What you’re doing...                                      Orion: (Her little whimpers are turning me on so much... I can’t get enough of her taste...)        Nancy: Oh, my C-Champion feels... Oh, s-screw the Champion shit... Yes Orion! YES! *Moaning louder* Ahhh... d-don’t... don’t stop... Jesus Christ... I g-guess you... really could be a... good         candidate after all... MMmmmh... I c-can’t remember... t-the last time... I’ve f-felt like th– AH!  AH! Oh my god Orion, I think I'm actually g-going to c-come...                                      Orion: (Already?)                                                                                   Nancy: I haven’t b-been able to... in s-so long... P-Please! Don’t stop! Right... There... You...   You're... AAAAAhhh...!!! AAAhhhhhhhhh....                                                           Orion: (Damn, she came HARD!)                                                                       Nancy: OH MY GOD!!! I c-can’t... F-Feel my legs... Ahhh... Christ!! I’m looking like some           inexperienced teenager here... this is so embarrassing... What have you done to me?! AAaahh...      P-Please, give me a minute... I need to...                                                          Orion: You took care of me countless times... *Dragging her to the edge of the pool* Now I want to  keep taking full care of you...                                                                     Nancy: *Giggles* Orion! You’re insatiable!                                                          Orion: I wanna make you squirm again... Just relax... And let me do all the work...                 Nancy: Mmhm...                                                                                      Orion: *Lifting her hips* Now come here...                                                          Nancy: Oh Orion, how are you so strong?! OH MY GOD...!                                              Orion: (I'll focus on her clit now... keep my licks gentle and steady...)                           Nancy: AAaaaaahh... *Moaning* Oh my g-gawd....                                                      Orion: (Man, Nancy is dripping wet right now...)                                                    Nancy: *Moaning* Ahhh.... ahhh... aghh... Yeah...                                                   Orion: (I love how flexible she is. The yoga classes are definitely paying off...)                  Nancy: Aaaaaah... y-yeahh...!                                                                       Orion: (Who would’ve thought we’d end up in this kind of pose together...)                          Nancy: Keep that rhythm Orion... Aaaahh...                                                          Orion: W-What was that...?                                                                          Nancy: Ahh, w-what? I d-didn't hear anything...                                                     Orion: All the water is gone too...                                                                 Nancy: M-Maybe a p-pipe e-exploded... I d-don’t care... just PLEASE D-DON’T STOP NOW!               Orion: Now you'll see what else I can do...                                                         Nancy: A-A-AAAHHH... H-Holyyy fuuuck!! Orion!!                                                      Orion: (This pose is so damn sexy. And I can suck on her clit at the perfect angle... The way she’s gyrating her hips... it’s like she’s begging for more...)                                           Nancy: AAAaahhh... AAAAhhh.. J-Jesus Christ...                                                      Orion: (She's getting there...)                                                                     Nancy: AAAAaaghhh... Oh g-god, Orion...!!! Please keep going... Take all of me... I’m yours my      b-boy... ...aaaAHHHHhh....                                                                          Orion: (Time to shift into the final gear...)                                                       Nancy: AAAAaaghhh... HHHgggg... T-This is... insane...                                              Orion: (Her legs are trembling.)                                                                    Nancy: I'M G-GONNAA C-CUM A-AGAAAIN...! AHHH.... AAAHHHHH! R-Right there, right there, right        t-thereeeeee... AAHH Y-YEAAH! THAT’S ITTTTT...!!! GGgggghhh....                                     Orion: (Holy shit, that was a huge orgasm! Her entire lower body is quivering...)                   Nancy: *Panting* J-Jesus... C-Christ... I d-didn't even know... I c-could feel like this... Oh      Orion...                                                                                            Orion: Your taste and smell are so intoxicating, Nancy...                                           Nancy: *Giggles* I c-can't believe I've come two times in a row... in such a short amount of time... You made a mess of me...                                                                           Orion: Phew, that position was exhausting, but well worth it. I just need to catch my breath for a  sec...                                                                                              Nancy: I thought you wanted to take full care of me...?                                             Orion: Well look who’s insatiable now...                                                            Nancy: *Getting on top of you* It’s time I get what I’ve been really hungry for...                  Orion: Oh my god... A-Are you sure you wan–                                                         Nancy: I want you to fuck me, Orion. I've wanted you to fuck me ever since I first saw you in that  park. I thought maybe it was just a fleeting urge and it’d pass quickly... but no... I can’t stop   thinking about you filling me up. I want to fulfill all the fantasies I haven't even dared to tell  anyone about.                                                                                       Orion: I'll fulfill them all...                                                                     Nancy: And now... Your huge cock is gonna be deep inside of me... So I can feel every inch of you... This time though... I want you to lie back and let your babysitter do all the work... Because I’m  gonna ride you until you burst...                                                                   Orion: Oh my god, Nancy...                                                                          Nancy: AAahh...                                                                                     Orion: I can’t believe this is really happening...                                                  Nancy: *Giggles* Believe it, baby... Now fuck me already... AAAaahh...                              Orion: Ohhh fuuuu...                                                                                Nancy: God Orion, you’re so damn big...                                                             Orion: Yeah... and that’s only the tip...                                                           Nancy: Please... push it deeper... fill me up!!                                                     Maximo: MY EMPRESS!                                                                                 Nancy: *Whispering* W-What the...!                                                                  Maximo: Are you in here?!                                                                           Nancy: *Whispering* H-Hide! Stay down!                                                              Orion: *Whispering* What for? It’s only a guard!                                                    Nancy: *Whispering* I'm the Empress now, remember? I have a reputation to uphold!                   Orion: *Whispering* What?!                                                                          Nancy: *Whispering* And that’s Maximo too! He knows Dalia! He could tell her what he saw!           Orion: *Whispering* Oh, that's a good point.                                                        Maximo: MY EMPRESS?!                                                                                Nancy: *Clears throat* W-What is it, Maximo? Can't you see that the Empress is taking a bath? I’m   indecent right now!                                                                                 Maximo: OH! *Turning around* I'm so sorry, your Highness. I did not mean to intrude on your alone   time!                                                                                               Nancy: Come back later. I'm a little... busy right now.                                             Maximo: My apologies, my lady, but it couldn’t wait! It’s an emergency! We're being attacked!       Nancy: Attacked?                                                                                    Maximo: It’s the Eastern Roman Empire! They’ve launched a surprise attack to retake the city! Their armies have surrounded us and they're bombarding our walls with trebuchets and battering rams! I’m  afraid the walls won't hold much longer!                                                            Nancy: Oh my... Well, dispatch some reinforcements... and bolster our wall defenses!                Maximo: But we need you! Without the Empress leading the defensive forces, our men are losing the   will to fight and they’re leaving the server! I fear defeat may be imminent!                        Nancy: I refuse to let those ERE bastards take my city! Take OUR city!                              Orion: *Whispering* H-Haven't you only been playing on this server for like... less than four hours?Nancy: Deploy our crossbow squadron to the top of the north wall! Tell the ground forces to prepare a barricade for when they break through the gate! Gather all the cavalry in the yard and wait for   me! We'll skirt the ridge and flank them.                                                           Maximo: YES, MY EMPRESS!                                                                            Nancy: *Getting dressed* I’m... I’m sorry Orion! I need to go! Could you head back to the real world and tell Dalia or Penelope to order some pizzas for dinner? I’ll join you all as soon as I’ve taken care of these uncultured swine!                                                                    Orion: O-Of course. (Man, blue-balled by fucking war. Why does God hate me?) Do you know anything   about military command?                                                                             Nancy: Well I've read Sun Tzu's Art of War, and I used to ride horses when I was younger, so... I   hope that counts for something. I’ll see you soon, Orion. I’ve been told there's an Exit Portal just around the corner from here.                                                                       Orion: W-Wait! About what just happened... Or, what was about to happen... Was this just a... one   time thing for you? For us?                                                                         Nancy: A one time thing? Baby... you’ve managed to satisfy a hunger in me that I’ve had for so long. I've been holding back for years... but I refuse to limit myself anymore. It’s time I take what I  want. And the truth is, I only want you Orion... all of you. It’s time we fully enjoy all the       pleasures of life... don't you think?                                                               Orion: I couldn't agree more...                                                                     Nancy: So, to answer your question... as long as you're okay with it... No. This sure as hell won’t be a one-time thing. And the next time we get some alone time... I plan to pick up right where we   left off.                                                                                           Orion: God, yes...                                                                                  Nancy: Well, I have a city to save. Goodbye, Orion...                                               Orion: Goodbye, Nancy... (Holy shit! Did that really just happen?! Man, I was so damn close to      fucking Nancy...! God, she’s going to drive me insane until I can finally be fully inside of her... I wonder when that "next time" will be... Geez, those trebuchets are really doing some damage. But I might as well head back to the real world since I can't do much more here. I’m sure Dalia and      Penelope will wonder what took us so long... Little do they know... heh.) *Removing your visor*     Phew... (What time is it?) *Looking at your phone* (Fuck, it's so late... I still have to call Chang so we can start the heist preparations. If something goes wrong, we could be captured, killed, or  even... excommunicated. No. Power of positive thinking, Orion. We're gonna develop the perfect plan, steal that Gem of Doom, get invited to that big shot dinner, and then we'll gather valuable        information about Ulysses... Or at least the whereabouts of the other Gems. Penelope and Nancy seem to be catching onto Eternum pretty quickly. I’d say we have a very strong and well-balanced team    with them on board.) LET’S MAKE IT HAPPEN!                                                          Penelope: *From downstairs* Orion? Is that you? Finally!                                            Dalia: *From downstairs* Come on! I'm starving!                                                     Orion: Coming!                                                                                      Nancy: Wow, it’s really pouring out there! And here I thought I could use Eternum to escape from    Kredon’s crazy weather...                                                                           Luna: I don’t mind. I enjoy watching the rain and hearing it against the window.                    Nancy: Why is it so dark outside? I can barely even see the buildings across the street.            Luna: It’s always nighttime on this server. It’s called "Sin City" and they really adhere to their  dark-centric themes. I learned about this place thanks to Nova. This particular sector was abandoned years ago. There's nothing of interest here, so no one really bothers to visit. I like to come here when I want to be alone. I've actually never even seen another player in these parts. That’s why I thought it'd be the perfect place to plan our heist.                                                Nancy: I gotta admit, this place is pretty cool. It has such a mysterious and exciting atmosphere.  Annie: AAAAH! Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!!! This is so exciting! I’m getting to meet a REAL    elf! A legitimate elven princess! I never would’ve guessed that you’d be the third Weapon of Atlas! Can I... Can I touch your ears? Please?!                                                            Calypso: Of course not!                                                                             Annie: But they're so cute and pointy! Pretty pretty please! I’ll be gentle!                        Calypso: I am the Princess of the Sy-tel-quessir! If we were in my realm, you would be executed for attempting such a thing!                                                                            Annie: B-But we're not there! And I won’t tell anyone from your realm, I promise! Just this time!   Only this once, and then I'll never bother you again!                                               Calypso: . . . *Sighs* This is completely against all traditional standards of royal conduct... But alright, fine! Just this once!                                                                      Annie: Yay!! Oh my god, they're so soft!!!                                                          Calypso: . . .                                                                                      Alex: I’m glad you joined us, Calypso. I thought you said you weren't gonna come.                   Calypso: Yes, well... I did not want to at first, but... I feel like I still owe you all for        rescuing me from my imprisonment. And if I am being honest, until I am able to discover how to      return to my world, I do not have much else to do.                                                  Alex: Well, regardless, thank you.                                                                  Calypso: I refuse to wear your peasant garments, however. My white robes represent the pride and    purity of my race. We consider clothing like a part of our own body.                                Dalia: Eh... I wouldn't worry too much about it, Calypso. Looks like you're not the only one who    didn't adhere to the dress code.                                                                    Penelope: What’s that supposed to mean? I'm wearing the exact same outfit as everyone else. I just  added a splash of color to make it way more stylish. Wearing all black is so outdated.              Dalia: Yeah, well, this isn't a fashion show. We dressed like this to blend in. If you go outside   looking like that, they’ll see us coming a mile away! Might as well have worn a construction        worker’s reflective vest...                                                                         Nova: *Jumping over the couch* Well I think it looks great on you, Penny! I don't know all the      details of Chang and Orion's plan, but we'll probably end up changing clothes before the heist      anyways. You look beautiful in pink!                                                                Penelope: Awwwww... thank you, Nova! You're like the cute, supportive little sister I never had!    Nova: I think I'm a couple of months older than you, b-but thank you.                               Dalia: That hurt, you know?                                                                         Penelope: I'm just spitting facts.                                                                  Dalia: I've always been supportive of you!                                                          Penelope: No, you haven't! You never like or comment on any of my Instagram posts!                  Dalia: Because I don't use it much. You should know I like your work.                               Penelope: How would I? You never say anything about it! And you never even tell me that you love me.Dalia: Yes I do... sometimes.                                                                       Penelope: Nope. Never.                                                                              Dalia: Sometimes.                                                                                   Penelope: Never.                                                                                    Dalia: Sometimes.                                                                                   Penelope: Well fine! Say it now then.                                                               Dalia: Um...  I love you.                                                                           Penelope: What? I couldn’t hear you.                                                                Dalia: . . . I love you. Even if you always get on my nerves.                                       Penelope: Yay! Awwww, I love you too sissy!                                                         Dalia: *Chuckles*                                                                                   Luna: Oh, by the way... how did it go on the Semper Invicta server?                                 Nancy: Oh well, it was eventful to say the least! There was a civil war that broke out shortly after we arrived, but despite that, we all had a lot of fun!                                             Dalia: Orion defeated a guy that was like three feet taller than him! Also, the Emperor tried to    force Mom into being his concubine, but she ended up seizing power and becoming the new Empress! I  still have no idea how she pulled it off! All during her first couple hours of playing, too. After  Orion’s match I had to leave the server, so I missed out on all the action that followed.           Nancy: Yeah, I took Orion on a tour of the palace afterward. We visited the atrium for awhile and he showed me a few of the skills he’s learned. The battle started just as we were about to visit the  stables. Luckily, I was able to successfully lead the defensive effort to repel the enemy, so... I  guess I'm still their "Empress".                                                                    Orion: (Definitely showed her some of my “skills”, that’s for sure... Damn, she said all that so    effortlessly and kept a straight face... she’s so sly!)                                             Nancy: Right, Orion?                                                                                Orion: W-What? Oh yeah, sure, um... quite a lovely atrium... mmhmm!                                 Luna: Oh, by the way... how did it go on the Semper Invicta server?                                 Nancy: Oh well, it was eventful to say the least! There was a civil war that broke out shortly after we arrived, but despite that, we all had a lot of fun! Except for the Rotunda event, maybe.        Dalia: A gladiator that was like three feet taller than Orion decapitated him!                      Orion: *Clears throat* Alright, girls! We're all here now, so... let's begin. I’m going to need your full concentration from here on out. Thank you for coming on such short notice. This had to be done today in order for the plan to work. This meeting is being held in Eternum because it’s much easier for all of us to play from home.                                                                   Nova: I'm not home, though! I'm playing through the Eternumverse Hub, in that cyber cafe on 12th and Beech.                                                                                             Dalia: Oh, they're open again?!                                                                     Luna: I thought they closed a few weeks ago.                                                        Nova: They did, but they’ve reopened under new ownership!                                           Dalia: Do they still have those amazing blueberry muffins?!                                         Nova: Hell yeah! I devoured one before I logged on!                                                 Luna: Oh, those are so good!                                                                        Calypso: What is this... muffin... you speak of?                                                    Dalia: Oh, you're missing out! They're like miniature cakes with–                                   Orion: Is this what “FULL CONCENTRATION” means to you?!                                             Dalia: Oh... shit, yeah, sorry. Go on. *Whispers to Nancy* Someone needs a muffin...                Nancy: *Giggles*                                                                                    Orion: Thank you. As I was saying, we have a... 194-page (Jesus Christ!) script of everything we    have to do. My friend Chang helped me with it. Now, I know what you're thinking... how the hell are we gonna follow a plan created by someone who doesn't even play Eternum? Legitimate concern, yes.   But I can assure you, I wouldn’t trust any other person with such a task. Chang has seen every      single movie with a heist, robbery, or any sort of plot twist... hundreds of times! I've seen him   create master plans for the most stupid of things!                                                  Dalia: But he doesn't know what our skills are. Won’t that be important for how the tasks are       assigned?                                                                                           Orion: He does know. I spent several hours with him yesterday explaining everything about the skills you have, the gadgets you own, and even how your personalities are.                                Dalia: Hah! I don’t think you know us as well as you believe. After all, you’ve only been living    with us for a short while. And the others, you only met them a few weeks ago!                       Orion: I can get a pretty good feel for people quickly. I’m confident I know almost everything about you.                                                                                               Dalia: Yeah, suuuure... alright, let’s put that to the test then. What's my favorite movie, Mr. Know It All?                                                                                            Rocky                                                                                               Orion: It's Rocky.                                                                                  The Lord of the Rings                                                                               Orion: It's The Lord of the Rings. All three films.                                                 Dalia: H-How... How did you know that? We've never even talked about movies!                        Fight Club                                                                                          Orion: It's Fight Club.                                                                             Harry Potter                                                                                        Orion: It's Harry Potter. The... third one.                                                         Million Dollar Baby                                                                                 Orion: It's Million Dollar Baby. I’m telling you... I know everything about you. When you care about someone, you pay close attention to all the little things. Their tastes and preferences become     important to you too.                                                                               Dalia: Wrong!                                                                                       Orion: Erm... Well, that's completely irrelevant! Stop distracting me, I’m trying to give you my    full concentration! *Clears throat* Anyway, getting back on topic... We have a team of 9 people. Me, level 1. (Damn Jasticus...) Me, level 6. Annie, level 33. Alex, level 27. Luna, level 32. Calypso, level... uhh... never mind. Guess this only applies to people from... our world. Nancy, level 2.    Dalia, level 27. Penelope, also level 2. And Nova, level... 34! Damn, not bad.                      Calypso: Does this level determine your place in a societal hierarchy?                              Orion: Um... Not really. It's just for Eternum. We can level up simply by playing regularly, but if you complete specific quests, it’ll grant you extra XP. And the higher your level is, the longer    it’ll take to reach the next level.                                                                 Dalia: You know, all this extra information is great and all, but we still haven’t heard anything   from this grand plan of yours.                                                                      Orion: *Chuckles*                                                                                   Alex: Orion?                                                                                        Orion: Alright girls... Get ready to pick your jaws up off the floor, because you’re about to       witness the greatest scheme of all time. It’s going to be the most ingenious robbery the world’s    ever seen! The mother of all heists! Now, let’s begin. This... is our playground... The Garrington  District.                                                                                           Alex: Wow, complete with a PowerPoint presentation too eh? So fancy.                                Orion: This district is the boulevard for Eternum’s most wealthy. You can find the Garrington Bank, Garrington Casino, and Garrington Grand Hotel all within a 1000-foot radius.                        Nancy: Seems like this Garrington person really thinks very highly of themselves...                 Orion: That person... is our primary target. Cornelius Garrington. He founded his first company     before he even graduated from high school. He's smart. Too smart. He has no weaknesses... He has    state-of-the-art security systems installed in each of his properties. His bank? It’s been able to  thwart all previous robbery attempts. His casino? Can’t even hide a poker chip in your pocket       without getting caught. Staying at his hotel and want to take a hand towel home as a souvenir? Don’t even think about it!                                                                               Luna: So he doesn’t have any weak points?                                                           Orion: He himself doesn’t have any. But... His son does. Bennie Garrington. Reckless, irresponsible, and impulsive. His father stopped trusting him a year ago, after he was arrested for cocaine       possession in the real world. Despite the mistrust, Bennie is still the key to this entire          operation. Only he and his father can deactivate the genotronic scans of the family vault. This     thing is stacked with security. I’m talking cameras, magic blockers, armed guards, 24-hour          surveillance – the works! Some people say it’s the safest place in all Eternum.                     Annie: This is the place we’re trying to break into...?                                             Orion: You're goddamn right.                                                                        Nancy: What are we even trying to get in there?                                                     Orion: A Gem of Doom. If we manage to get our hands on all ten of these, we could end up as the     richest and most powerful people on Earth.                                                          Penelope: You make it sound so easy!                                                                Orion: We have all the floorplans and schematics of the bank, casino, hotel, and even Cornelius’ own damn personal apartment. All courtesy of my one and only personal hacker.                          Nova: *Giggles* It was a breeze! Like stealing candy from a baby!                                   Calypso: Why would you want to steal delicious sustenance from an innocent child...?                Orion: We have the patrol schedule of the guards, locations of all ventilation systems, passwords to their security networks, and a perfect plan to put it all together. Guaranteed success.            Alex: Someone seems quite confident! Alright pretty boy, what do we have to do?                     Orion: Each one of you has a very specific task with corresponding instructions. All you have to do is stick to the plan... don’t deviate from the steps... and then in the end, we’ll be walking away  with a Gem of Doom. Our first step will be to– *Whispering* What the... *Whispering* Did you hear   that?                                                                                               Luna: *Whispering* I think someone knocked on the door...                                           Orion: *Whispering* Does anyone know we're here?                                                    Alex: *Whispering* No one. And nobody followed us either. I made sure of it.                        Luna: *Whispering* This District is always deserted... completely empty.                            Orion: *Whispering* Maybe some noob is exploring this area in hopes of finding something to do.     Alex: *Whispering* Yeah, maybe they saw our light in the window.                                    Luna: *Whispering* They could be seeking shelter from the rain too.                                 Orion: *Standing up* Hmm... maybe. I'll go take a look, just in case. Stay here.                    Annie: O-Okay.                                                                                      Orion: (Damn, I didn’t realize how creepy this apartment looks... That mysterious knocking sure did add to the creepiness too... Alright... calm down, Orion. There's nothing to worry about. We haven't done anything illegal... yet. Who could that be, though...?) *Gulps* Hello?                        . . . .                                                                                             Orion: Who's there?                                                                                 . . . .                                                                                             Orion: (Hm, silence. Well, whoever it was, it looks like they left already.) Don't worry girls,     they’re gone now. It was probably just a player who got lost.                                       . . . .                                                                                             Orion: Um, girls...? Can you hear me? *Turning around* (What the hell...) W-Who's there?!           . . . .                                                                                             Orion: (W-What the fuck is going on...) *Hyperventilating* HELLO?! ANSWER ME!! . . . (It better not be some stupid punk trying to pull a prank... T-That’s probably what’s happening... But... Why am I starting to feel sick to my stomach...?) . . .                                                      Open the door
