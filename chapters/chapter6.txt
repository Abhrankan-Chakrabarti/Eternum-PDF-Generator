???: War. Fear. Pain. Death. Every single one of you has endured more than what people could ever   imagine or begin to understand. You saw your brothers-in-arms fall before you. You watched the light in their eyes fade away. One by one. Hundreds of soldiers just like you, with families at home,    desperately praying for their safe return... Only for those prayers to receive bitter answers. I    know how you feel, my brothers, for in your eyes I see the same fear that also strikes directly into my heart. Yes, I too am afraid. Afraid for humanity. Afraid of humanity. I am afraid because I have witnessed the atrocities that mankind can commit on its own. The cries of agony from the wounded.  The snapping of bones under the weight of enemy tanks. These sounds hauntingly whisper to me as I   lay awake at night and I hopelessly fight to resist the madness that consumes me. And yet... We     still stand here. Dawn has greeted us and we live to breathe yet another breath! And with that      breath... we stand together. We keep fighting. No matter how loud the void calls to us, no matter   how strong Death tries to grip us, we’ll hold our chins up high. We won’t look back. We'll march on. And believe me, I know very well that one question continues to persist in all of your thoughts... what are we fighting for? Well... I'll tell you. We fight for our fallen brothers. We fight for the loved ones eagerly awaiting our return. We fight for the next generation. We fight... for our       future. And if ultimately our luck runs out, and you finally lose the game of tempting fate...      Unable to live to see the future you helped shape... Fear not, because I will bring you home. I’ll  pin the medals upon your chest. I’ll tell your mother that you gave it your all. Because no matter  what comes our way... We fight together.                                                            Soldier: . . . ...Who are you?                                                                      ???: Hmph. That... that’s a question I myself have struggled to answer for some time. People have   looked to me for many things. A symbol of strength. A fountain of wisdom. A bastion of courage.     *Chuckles* As flattering as it was, I never paid much attention to such things. But now... *Climbing the trench* Now I’ve finally accepted who I am. I have finally understood... that I can no longer  outrun the fate that awaits me. I know why I am here. Yes, I am a hero. YES. I am the chosen one. I am the man to unite the lost... strengthen the weak... and embolden the fearful. I am the one who   will lead you all to victory. The one who will gather the 10 Gems of Doom, sit on the throne of     Eternum, and finally fulfill the prophecies! For that... ...is my destiny.                          Jerry: SO LISTEN UP, GENTLEMEN! Glory and honor are at hand! The enemy knows not what awaits them!  Forge your names into the history books of Eternum now... AND LIVE FOREVER! CHAAAAAAARGE!!!!        Soldier: FOR ETERNUM!                                                                               Soldier: FOR THE WRE!!!!                                                                            Jerry: ATTACK!!!!!!! . . . Huh...? Aw, shit.                                                        Penelope: Oof, I think Jerry stepped on a landmine.                                                 Dalia: *Climbing the trench* Agh, fucking idiot. Why am I not surprised? I told him not to run out  into the open. At this rate, he's never gonna make it past level 10.                                Penelope: On the bright side, at least his speech seems to have motivated our troops. Look at how   they're charging.                                                                                   Dalia: Well, that's something. Guess his pretentiousness finally provided some value.               Penelope: Are Alex, Luna, and Nova supposed to be at the rendezvous point already?                  Dalia: Yeah, I think they had enough time to make it by now. Hopefully they’ve managed to take down the first defensive line of machine guns so we can have direct access to the bunker.                Annie: *Grumbling* Who on Earth built these trenches? Giants?! These ledges are way too low... even on my tippy toes, I can barely see over! Hmph. Are we winning?                                      Penelope: Yes? It's hard to tell from... Uhh... I-Is that tank aiming in our d-direction?           The three girls lose their balance and fall into the trench.                                        Dalia: Ouch...                                                                                      Penelope: O-Okay, I guess we're not going that way.                                                 Dalia: Aghh... is it really worth doing all this?                                                   Penelope: I mean, we received pretty legit intel that a WRE rival hid a Gem of Doom in this server, so...                                                                                               Dalia: I know! But damn if it isn’t a drag... *Sighs* Anyways, I guess we should stay put until     those tanks have been taken care of.                                                                Penelope: Was that tank even theirs? It looked like an American M4 Sherman. I thought they had a    Soviet arsenal and we were on the American side...?                                                 Dalia: Meh, I guess everyone uses whatever is readily available or whatever they're most comfortable with. I think one of our squads is wielding lightsabers and another is riding wyverns, so...       Penelope: Really? Doesn't that break peoples’ immersion?                                            Dalia: *Standing up* Oh yeah, because Eternum roleplay servers are all about accuracy. I mean, have you seen how we’re dressed? Are these skimpy outfits really the best for combat?                    Penelope: *Giggles* Oh, that one’s on me. I was online shopping a few weeks ago and saw all these   cute outfits. I started picturing all of us as foxy G.I. Janes and I just couldn’t help myself. Mom thought they were hot too! No matter the occasion, one should always dress sexy and stylish! Just   look at you both! Girl, if looks could kill! When you have a tummy like yours, sis, why hide it? You spend all that time getting in shape at the gym... now’s the time to flaunt it!                    Dalia: Yeah, yeah, and my toned abs will totally deflect any bullets too.                           Penelope: Come on! You really think that ugly, baggy shirt you were gonna wear would’ve protected   you any better? And besides, I see you chose the skimpiest option available! Don't think I didn't   notice that... Trying to grab someone’s attention with that sexy underboob?                         Dalia: W-What?                                                                                      Penelope: *Giggles* Great choice, by the way.                                                       Dalia: W-What are you talking about, t-this is the only outfit I received in my inventory!          Penelope: Was it? I'm pretty sure there were a few more options to choose from...                   Dalia: Well, you're wrong!                                                                          Penelope: If you say so...                                                                          Dalia: W-Why would I have chosen this willingly?!                                                   Penelope: Because it looks so spicy on you! This clothing line is so HOT! I'm sure Annie digs it.   She’s looking amazing too!                                                                          Annie: I actually do really like this outfit! It's really comfy and I love that there are so many   pockets! Why do women’s clothes never have any pockets?!                                            Dalia: Truth is, you do look really good, Annie! But you’d look cute in anything.                   Annie: Awww... t-thank you, girls! That means a lot coming from you two!                            Maximo: Area, ah-ten-HUT!                                                                           Nancy: Fall in and stand at ease!                                                                   Annie: Sir, yes, sir, ma’am, ready, sir, yessum! Private Annie Winters reports!                     Nancy: AAAAAH, how can you be so adorable?! You are just the cutest little pookie-bear on this      server! How could anyone even think about harming such an angel?!                                   Annie: T-Thank you, sir, ma'am, sir.                                                                Nancy: Okay girls, it's your moment to shine! Are you ready?                                        Dalia: You bet we are! I was getting stir-crazy waiting here while all the fun is happening! Can't  wait to finally see some action!                                                                    Nancy: Excellent! I want you two to pair up and have each other’s six. We’re really counting on your restoration abilities, Penelope! We're counting on you, Penelope! This is your first real mission. Penelope: I won’t let you down! I'm getting much better with my healing spells. Don't worry, no harm will come Dalia’s way!                                                                             Dalia: And I won't let anyone get close to Penny. I’m the only one allowed to beat her ass!         Maximo: The sun has finally come out, my Empress. And it appears our armored division has           neutralized all enemy tanks.                                                                        Nancy: Alright then, NOW IS OUR CHANCE! Time to deliver the coup de grace! You two will flank their main squad by the river and clear the East flank. Try to be as stealthy as possible. The element of surprise is our advantage here! Meanwhile, Nova, Alex, and Luna are in charge of the North, West,   and South flanks, respectively. Radio me as soon as you’ve cleared everything out.                  Penelope: Yes, ma'am!                                                                               Dalia: We won't fail you!                                                                           Annie: What are my orders, ma'am? I'm ready to fight!                                               Nancy: Don't worry Annie, you can come with me and help filter any received radio transmissions.    Annie: Yes, m– Wait, what...? Comms duty? I wanna do badass things too!                             Nancy: But that would be so dangerous! You'll be safer at our base camp!                            Annie: Dangerous? Dangerous for who? They’re the ones that should be worried! Why can't I join the  action with Dalia and Penny?!                                                                       Nancy: Well, you know, the  trenches are more for... “frontline” players. Like... the ones skilled  with melee, range, or magic.                                                                        Dalia: What Mom is trying to say is that... W-Well, we haven't really ever seen you do anything with your magic, so... we kinda assumed that you didn't have much combat experience. W-Which is good!   Totally okay! Not all Eternum players have to be fighters!                                          Annie: . . . ? You think I'm USELESS?                                                               Nancy: O-Of cooourse not, sweetie! It's just that... I thought you'd be a little more useful in–    Annie: Oh my god! It’s TRUE! You think I’m as useless as Jerry!                                     Penelope: No one said that!                                                                         Annie: How long have you guys thought of me like this? Does everyone else think that way too?! Oh my god, does that include Orion?!!!                                                                   Nancy: I'm sure he doesn't, Annie! Of course not, Annie!                                            Annie: It's not my fault! I just haven’t had my time to shine! We always end up on either scary     servers, servers where magic is disabled, or non-combat ones! I-I... I respectfully request to be   sent to the frontline, ma'am! I'll show you all what I'm capable of! I promise!                     Nancy: Eh... Well, umm, o-okay then! I guess you can go with Dalia and Penelope.                    Annie: Yes, ma'am!                                                                                  Nancy: Maximo, order the artillery to commence firing and deploy the elemental magic squad behind   the tanks!                                                                                          Maximo: Yes, my Empress!                                                                            Soldier: Hey... Yo, Cruz, I think I found that woman! Yeah... it has to be her. It's our chance! If we kill their leader they’ll be sitting ducks! Should I launch the Predator missile? . . . *Zooming in* Yeah, it's definitely her. She matches the description. Come on, Cruz, get on the radio and call the General! I need confirmation! . . . For fuck's sake, dude, can you fucking focus?! If we're the ones to kill that redheaded bitch we'll be recognized as heroes! Huh? (Where the fuck did everyone go? Did they really leave while I was on the radio?) *Standing up* (What the fuck was that scream?!) CRUZ?! Are you okay?! Don't worry, I'm coming! *Walking through the trenches* (What the fuck is    going on... Did the enemy get here already? No... that's impossible... I'd have heard the alarms.   But then... where the fuck is everyone? It's almost as if–) *Turning around* I HEARD THAT! I-I know y-you're there! Stop hiding! Come out you fucking bas– . . . *Hyperventilating* . . .               *Hyperventilating* (What the hell... T-There was something behind me, I could feel its presence.    Okay, calm down, Lucas, you're just imagining things. Let's go back to base and–)                   . . . .                                                                                             Soldier: . . . AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!!!                                                                 Soldier: W-What the fuck is going on here?                                                          Soldier: Why are these trenches empt...                                                             Soldier: WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING?!                                                              Soldier: Oh shit...                                                                                 Soldier: KILL IT!!!                                                                                 Alex: Agh... motherfucker! (Dammit, I had to untransfigure myself sooner than I hoped. Even in my   tiger form, there's a limit to the damage I can take. Now how am I going to cover myself...? I left my outfit back at the entrance of the trenches, a couple of miles from here. Hmm... maybe I can     improvise something from those rags over there.) Hmm... (Well... better than nothing, I guess. I    suppose I could use one of the bloody shirts of the enemies I took out, but... ugh. That's kinda    gross. It should be okay, I think my job here is already done anyway. I shouldn't find anyone else. Let's go back to where I left my uniform.)                                                          Soldier: Hey, you! Who the hell are you?!                                                           Alex: . . .                                                                                         Soldier: Are you deaf? Turn around!                                                                 Alex: *Turning around* Ah! At last! Thank god you finally appeared, I was starting to lose my mind! Soldier: Put your hands in the air where I can see them!                                            Alex: I'm not doing that, can't you see I'm naked? What are you, one of those fucking perverts that try to take advantage of women in combat servers?                                                   Soldier: Of course not! I just... W-Why are you naked?                                              Alex: Uhh... I was kidnapped. By the WRE. I managed to run away from my captors and returned to our trenches as fast as I could.                                                                        Soldier: And how do I know you're not lying?                                                        Alex: Why would I lie?                                                                              Soldier: I don't know, to save your skin, perhaps?                                                  Alex: Well, yeah, that's a fair point.                                                              Soldier: Prove you're one of ours! What's the name of our leader?                                   Alex: Erm... Lieutenant Colonel Jasper Wagner, commander of the honorable Wagner Company, one of the largest and mightiest inter-server factions in all of Eternum.                                     Soldier: Hmm... You could have gotten that from our pamphlets... Repeat after me: Glory to the      Wagner Company. Fuck the WRE.                                                                       Alex: Uh... glory to the Wagner Company. Fuck the WRE. See? Super loyal. Are we done with the       interrogation now?                                                                                  Soldier: And one last question!                                                                     Alex: *Sighs* Oh boy...                                                                             Soldier: If you're one of ours you must have attended this morning's briefing. What platoons were   assigned to protect the North flank?                                                                Alex: Eh... They were... 4 and... ...7?                                                             Soldier: . . .                                                                                      Alex: ...and 10?                                                                                    Soldier: I KNEW YOU WERE A SPY! PUT YOUR HANDS UP!                                                  Alex: You just want to see my tits!                                                                 Soldier: Enough games! Do as I say or I'll put a bullet in your pretty face, you fucking b–         Nova: Never stand still on a server with snipers! That's Warfare 101!                               Alex: . . . Damn girl, I've never been happier to see you! Good shot!                               Nova: *Giggles* Thank you, thank you! I spotted him over a mile away but I didn't... I didn't...    W-Why are you naked?                                                                                Alex: I received a near-fatal wound in my tiger form, so I had to untransfigure. Then that soldier  caught me off guard, so I was trying to buy some time. I need a few minutes before being able to    transform again, especially if I used a powerful creature.                                          Nova: Like... some sort of refractory period?                                                       Alex: *Snorts* Yeah, pretty much.                                                                   Nova: I see... cool.                                                                                Alex: Alright! The whole Western flank should be clear. I think the guy you killed was the last one.Nova: Cool! I also wiped out the North flank completely! I was coming this way to help when I saw   that man pointing his gun at you.                                                                   Alex: Okay, so... if everything is going according to plan in the other flanks, the enemy must be   about to send the rest of their men this way. We should radio Nancy.                                Nova: Yep! We... Oh, speaking of the devil... someone is calling on the walkie. Must be Nancy. Moshi moshi?                                                                                             Annie: Nova?                                                                                        Nova: The one and only!                                                                             Dalia: Hello?                                                                                       Penelope: Annie?                                                                                    Nancy: Is everything okay?                                                                          Annie: Yes, it's me! Check the coordinates I sent you and look in that direction!                   Nova: Wait, let me find a vantage point!                                                            Alex: Do you need backup? We're too far!                                                            Annie: No, no! Just look in that direction! There's a huge enemy patrol by the bridge, with tanks   and tons of vehicles and infantry. *Giggles* Now watch this...                                      Nancy: Watch what?                                                                                  Dalia: I don't have line of sight on the bridge!                                                    Annie: No worries! Just look in the direction I sent you! *Mumbling* I'm gonna make an explosion so big that they'll be able to see it from every corner of the server. 3... 2... 1... W-What...?       Maximo: Impact confirmed! Enemies neutralized!                                                      Nancy: Oh! That's why you sent the coordinates!                                                     Penelope: Nice job, Annie!                                                                          Dalia: Great spotting! See? That was very useful!                                                   Alex: That was a big explosion indeed!                                                              Nova: You rock, Annie!                                                                              Annie: Wait, wait, wait... that's not what I wanted to... G-Goddammit! (Now I seem even more useless than before. Why am I so damn unlucky?! Okay, calm down Annie, I'm sure there are more enemies     somewhere. But if no one sees me doing it, they won't believe me and there won't be anyone to tell  Orion how awesome I can be! Maybe I could play with Orion in one of the magic servers I used to play in? But I don't want the girls to think I'm useless either! Come on, Annie, let's find more enemies and blast them with a nuclear orb that obliterates everything within a half-mile radius! But if no one sees me doing it, they won't believe me! Come on, Annie, let's find more enemies and blast them with a nuclear orb that obliterates everything within a half-mile radius! Let's go!)                Soldier: *Yawns* Dude, what time is it?                                                             Soldier: On this server? Like, 8 AM.                                                                Soldier: And in the real world?                                                                     Soldier: I don't know, probably like 6 or 7 PM.                                                     Soldier: *Yawns* Aaaagh. God, this is so boring. Dude, we got the worst flank. No one passes through here.                                                                                              Soldier: Stop calling me dude. And stop complaining so much. We literally get paid to stand here    doing nothing. Would you rather be at a nine-to-five job working like a slave for minimum wage?     Soldier: Well, I guess not. I just think that we could have been deployed to a more entertaining    position.                                                                                           Soldier: Someone has to protect the South flank.                                                    Soldier: Dude, if a fucking army was coming this way we'd see them from... Huh? What the...         Soldier: A girl?                                                                                    Soldier: D-Don't move! Identify yourself! Why isn’t she talking?                                    Soldier: You lost, cutie? Are you with the Wagner Company or the WRE? Eh? You know what, let's go to my tent. You must be cold and scared. Don't worry, we can warm up there for a bit and then I'll    take you to the nearest Exit Portal.                                                                Soldier: Dude, what the fuck is wrong with you?                                                     Soldier: What now?                                                                                  Soldier: That sounded like you're about to assault her in that filthy tent of yours.                Soldier: What the fuck are you talking about?! I just invited her to warm up in my tent, that's all.Soldier: It sounds... wrong. She's clearly confused and probably scared.                            Soldier: And that's why I offered it. Go play the moral police on another server. We're just two    adults... I'm doing nothing wrong. I mean... because you're already an adult, right, cutie?         Soldier: W-What's she doing now?                                                                    Soldier: I don't know... maybe she's a spy after all.                                               Luna: *Taking a deep breath* . . .                                                                  Soldier: I told you! Fuck, should we sound the alarm?                                               Soldier: Of course not, don't be a fucking pussy. It's just one chick. Shoot her.                   Soldier: What?! Why me?                                                                             Soldier: Because I am your superior and I am giving you a direct order.                             Soldier: But... she's just a girl...                                                                Soldier: This is supposed to be a war. People die. Get over it.                                     Luna: Increarbus severum.                                                                           Soldier: And now she's saying gibberish! Shoot already, for fuck's sake!                            Soldier: Agh, fuck! This is the last time I play with you. Sorry, kid. Hmm...?                      Anastasia: You opened fire on the mistress. Such uncivilized behavior.                              Soldier: W-Where did that come from?                                                                Soldier: What the fuck is that thing?                                                               Tatiana: Thing? He called us things, sister.                                                        Soldier: F-Fuck! There are more of them!                                                            Anastasia: Discourteous.

There's a back entrance through the sewer    system! Then there’s a small door locked by an access code, the PIN is 77463!                       Soldier: Dude, come on! You're a rat!                                                               Soldier: Shut the fuck up, I'm not gonna die because of a guy I don't give a shit about.            Tatiana: Your loyalty is despicable.                                                                Soldier: W-What? I told you what you wanted!                                                        Tatiana: Indeed. Contemptible nonetheless.                                                          Anastasia: We got the information required, mistress.                                               Luna: Thank you, girls! I'll pass along that info.                                                  Anastasia: Shall we commence Operation Spark?                                                       Luna: Yes, let's clear the South flank!                                                             Anastasia: It shall be done, mistress.                                                              Tatiana: We will bring this specimen with us.                                                       Soldier: L-Let me go!                                                                               Tatiana: We can use him to spot enemy locations.                                                    Soldier: And what about me? You can't leave me here like this! This is torture!                     Tatiana: Torture?                                                                                   Anastasia: We do not torture.                                                                       Tatiana: That would be graceless.                                                                   Anastasia: Uncivilized.                                                                             Soldier: Then what? Are you gonna kill me?!                                                         Anastasia: Our brother will take care of you.                                                       Tatiana: You will like him.                                                                         Anastasia: He is so refined.                                                                        Tatiana: Cultured.                                                                                  Anastasia: Professional.                                                                            Tatiana: Civilized.                                                                                 Anastasia: So civilized.                                                                            Soldier: What?! Are there more...                                                                   Pyramid Head: The time of judgment has come.                                                        Soldier: *Sobbing* . . .                                                                            Soldier: Sir, I received reports from all the flanks!                                               Colonel Wagner: And?                                                                                Soldier: North, East, and West flanks have fallen! The South flank still holds, but communications  were interrupted. We don't know what happened.                                                      Colonel Wagner: Dammit... We underestimated the WRE. Okay, listen up, soldier! Gather all our       remaining units and bring them in here! We'll fortify our defenses and hold position in this        bunker!                                                                                             Soldier: Yes, sir!                                                                                  Colonel Wagner: It doesn't matter if they have more firepower. No one has ever taken the Wagner     bunker and today will be no exception! I want all our men to form a barricade around both entrances! Post up troops there and there! NOW!                                                               Soldier: Copy that, sir! Moving out! I'll pass along the orders, sir!                               The soldier rushes out of the bunker.                                                               Colonel Wagner: *Sighs* Fuck... If it all goes wrong, I'll have to take the hidden escape route and leave alone. I can't afford to lose it. I can organize a comeback with the units that couldn't play today.                                                                                              Orion: Damn, and you'd leave all your men behind? That's kinda selfish, isn't it?                   Colonel Wagner: What the...                                                                         Orion: I mean, I wouldn't do it, but I guess I'm not one to judge.                                  Colonel Wagner: Who the fuck are you...?                                                            Orion: *Standing up* Me? (Mmmm... should I tell him my real name? Do I wanna be famous or stay under the radar? Could be a good opportunity to make a name for myself...)                               Orion Nobody The Huntsman Other                                                                     Orion: I am... Nobody.                                                                              Colonel Wagner: Nobody?                                                                             Orion: That would be me.                                                                            Colonel Wagner: Huh. Well, tell me, Nobody... How did you get past all my security checkpoints?     Orion: I went through the sewer system. It's obviously not a viable option for an entire army, but  it was perfect for a one man job.                                                                   Colonel Wagner: And the double-barricaded door? How the hell did you get the access code?           Orion: Your men snitched at the drop of a hat. Loyalty doesn't seem to be your faction’s forte.     Colonel Wagner: I see... Very clever. And what now? Did you come to kill me?                        Orion: No one has to die. All you have to do is surrender. You've already lost, Wagner.             Colonel Wagner: Of course... Well, I guess I have no choice left. Let's go to the command center,   I'll order the withdrawal of my troops. You have my word.                                           Orion: Good choice.                                                                                 Colonel Wagner: But you must lay down your weapons. I want assurances that you won't kill me after  I've sent the orders. I'll only agree to your terms if we both go unarmed.                          Orion: That seems fair. *Dropping the gun* That pistol was the only... . . . What...? Are you       serious? You gave me your word! Where's your honor?!                                                Colonel Wagner: Graveyards are full of honorable people. I don't give a fuck if I have to use       despicable methods to achieve my goal. I always win.                                                Orion: The WRE will take you down whether you kill me or not. Your army is finished.                Colonel Wagner: We both know this is not about the war.                                             Orion: What...?                                                                                     Colonel Wagner: The WRE only attacked after it was made public that I possessed a very valuable     item. I know this is not a coincidence.                                                             Orion: I-I don't know what you're talking about.                                                    Colonel Wagner: *Chuckles* Oh, really? Let me remind you, then... Ring a bell?                      Orion: . . .                                                                                        Colonel Wagner: I guess I am right. Don't blame yourself, boy. Everyone wants the Gems, but only the best player can gather them all. It was a valiant effort though, I'll admit.                       Orion: *Sighs* Okay... you got me.                                                                  Colonel Wagner: *Laughs* I knew it! You know what, I like you. I'll offer you a deal: if you start  working for me, I'll spare your life and you'll be able to keep your level and inventory. What do   you say?                                                                                            Orion: . . . Fuck you.                                                                              Colonel Wagner: Huh. So you choose... death. Disappointing. In Eternum, there are no second chances. Remember that when you're dead.                                                                    Orion: . . .                                                                                        Colonel Wagner: Game. Over. . . . What...? How...                                                   Orion: *Standing up* Your reflexes seem somewhat slow, eh?                                          Colonel Wagner: How... this bunker has...                                                           Orion: This bunker has a magic blocker. We know. I'd tell you how we're avoiding it, but that would ruin the mystery, don't you think?                                                                  Colonel Wagner: How did you know that...                                                            Orion: We know everything about you. We knew how you'd deploy your troops... How many men you had... Hell, we even knew about your favorite online platforms, your passwords, and your... concerning    fixation on cat girls.                                                                              Colonel Wagner: I-I don't what you're talking about.                                                Orion: We knew you'd be alone in this bunker, and that you'd have the Gem in your possession. You   lost this war before you even started it. But anyway... I'd love to stay and chat, but I'm a        terribly busy man.                                                                                  Colonel Wagner: . . . Who the fuck are you?                                                         Orion: I told you already, have you forgotten? I'm Nobody. Don't forget that name... you'll hear it again.                                                                                              Colonel Wagner: . . .                                                                               Soldier: SIR! All entrances to the bunker have been secured! Reinforcements are on the way!         Colonel Wagner: He took it...                                                                       Soldier: Sir...?                                                                                    Colonel Wagner: HE TOOK MY GEM! Find the fucking traitor who allowed that intruder to bypass my     magic blocker and bring them to me! The rest of you! Sweep the place until you find that thief! He  couldn’t have gone too far! WHAT NOW?!                                                              Soldier: *Whispering* Did... Did that man fall through the roof...?                                 Soldier: *Whispering* Impossible, there must be like 150 or 200 feet of sheer rock.                 Colonel Wagner: Wait... I know you...                                                               Thanatos: Where is the Gem of Doom?                                                                 Colonel Wagner: Y-You're Thanatos, aren't you?                                                      Soldier: *Whispering* Oh my god, I can't believe it's him...                                        Soldier: *Whispering* I thought he was a myth!                                                      Soldier: *Whispering* T-They say he's level 100...                                                  Soldier: *Whispering* I've heard he stabs his own back with an arrow every time he kills 1000       people!                                                                                             Thanatos: I said, where is... The Gem.                                                              Colonel Wagner: The Gem...? You're too late! Someone just stole it from me!                         Thanatos: . . . Who.                                                                                Colonel Wagner: Join my army and we'll take it back together!                                       Thanatos: Who.                                                                                      Colonel Wagner: Um... I don't know, he called himself... “Nobody”.                                  Thanatos: . . . Then you're no longer useful to me. Open the gates.                                 Colonel Wagner: Now, now, now... not so fast, Thanny. The goddess of fortune smiles upon us once    more, boys! We may have lost one Gem of Doom today, but 5 new ones just so happened to arrive on our doorstep! Isn't that marvelous? Hand them over, Thanatos. I might even let you live so you can keep your level, out of courtesy.                                                                       Thanatos slowly moves his left arm, grabbing the hilt of his sword.                                 Colonel Wagner: You're outnumbered fifty-to-one, Thanatos. Don't even try it.                       Soldier: Is that...                                                                                 Soldier: ...Hyas?                                                                                   Colonel Wagner: ARE YOU STUPID?! Is this how you want your legendary tale to end?! Surrender and    drop your weapons! You don't stand a chance, you're completely surrounded!                          Thanatos: Surrounded? All I am surrounded by... is fear. And dead men.                              Orion: (Mmmm... Fuck, I lost consciousness again.) *Standing up* (Well, at least now I'm capable of controlling my powers without going berserk. And I feel more powerful every day. That dude didn't   even see it coming! Step by step, Orion.) *Taking a deep breath* Ah, is this Ogygia's forest? This  place is beautiful!                                                                                 You turn around and see Calypso swinging her legs over the edge of a rock. “But not as beautiful as the Elven Princess that stands in front of me!”                                                     Orion: But not as beautiful as the elven princess that stands in front of me!                       Calypso: . . . Hmph.                                                                                “Although a bit cold. Wasn't there somewhere warmer?”                                               Orion: Although a bit cold. Wasn't there somewhere warmer?                                          Calypso: It is not my fault that your species cannot withstand the cold.                            Orion: *Chuckles* Fair enough.                                                                      “Why the long face, my Princess?”                                                                   Orion: Why the long face, my Princess?                                                              Calypso: I have had the same face for the last 84 years.                                            Orion: Well, I assume you were also born a baby like us humans, but... fair enough. I've gotta say, that was a great success! I can't believe we have 2 Gems already. We're getting closer to our goal  every day.                                                                                          Calypso: Mm-hm.                                                                                     Orion: Should we jump to another server now? I need to find an Exit Portal.                         Calypso: I have already made you appear near one of those artifacts of yours.                       Orion: *Turning around* Huh? Oh, true, I see it! Wonderful. I guess I should leave then. The girls  must be wondering how everything went.                                                              Calypso: Hmph.                                                                                      Orion: Are you okay...?                                                                             Calypso: I am.                                                                                      Orion: You don't look okay. Are you mad about something? Is it because I went on for too long with  my speech in front of the general? I'm sorry, I get carried away at tim–                            Calypso: I am not. Stop insisting I am unwell.                                                      Orion: Well, okay then. I won't insi–                                                               Calypso: *Standing up* Alright, maybe I am kind of annoyed.                                         Orion: Oh. (That's an interesting dress... God bless elven tailoring.)                              Calypso: Do you know who I am?                                                                      Orion: Uhh...                                                                                       Calypso: Because you clearly do not seem to understand it yet. Ever since our paths crossed, I have been essentially functioning as your personal maid. Me! The Princess of Hyril'ar! Calypso, create a portal here so we can safely escape! Calypso, help us jump  between servers so we can deceive our   enemies! Oh Calypso, please craft a portal here so we can outrun the authorities! I am the Princess of the Sy-tel-quessir! Yes, I owed you my freedom, but I only chose to help you because our         relationship was supposed to be mutually beneficial. I will never attain any information about my   realm if all I do is serve as your escape route in a quest to find Gems I do not care about.        Orion: *Gulps* I didn't know you felt that way. (I guess she has a point. I haven't really stopped  to think much about her since we found her.)                                                        Calypso: I have heard the farmers and villagers mentioning my name. They say I am a weapon. A tool. How dare they... I obey no one!                                                                     Orion: Where did you hear that?                                                                     Calypso: In the same filthy inn where you abandoned me weeks ago, where else? I practically         memorized the wood patterns of the floorboards within my chambers!                                  Orion: I can explain that! I went overseas to visit my father and grandparents for a couple of      weeks, and I've been so busy! I just came back to Kredon yesterday! That's why I've been more       distant.                                                                                            Calypso: That is a lie! I know you have been visiting these worlds too.                             Orion: Well... yeah, occasionally. I took the E-suit with me. But it was mostly to play alone and   practice my magical abilities! I wanted to keep up with the girls and... Wait, how do you know I've been playing Eternum?                                                                               Calypso: I could sense when you left what you call the “real world” and appeared in another realm.  Whether it was the desert, the grotto, or the jungle. And even if you think you have improved, your technique is still reminiscent of a lumbering ogre!                                                 Orion: So... You've been following me around and spying on me?                                      Calypso: . . . O-Of course not! I just... wanted to... I was curious. And bored. That is all.       Orion: *Chuckles* Hey, it's fine. Never be ashamed of wanting to satiate your curiosity...          Calypso: Hmph. But anyway, let us get back to the issue at hand...                                  Orion: Of course. What exactly is your wish, my Princess?                                           Calypso: I want to be informed of your goals and plans. And I want to go with you on the next       mission, as an active participant, not a getaway portal. The more I discover about the different    realms, the sooner I will be able to return home.                                                   Orion: Fair enough. About the information you want... well, we discovered that some people who      apparently died in our world are able to keep existing inside Eternum. Thanatos, the man who        attacked you here in Ogygia, is apparently one of them. My theory is that Ulysses found a way to... “digitize” human consciousness somehow. But I honestly don't know, it all still sounds too unreal to me.                                                                                                Calypso: I... see. And what is the next step?                                                       Orion: We're still trying to gather the 10 Gems of Doom in an attempt to unravel all the mystery.   They're the key to this whole thing. Nancy is using her connections to discover the possible        locations of the other Gems.                                                                        Calypso: Good. I like Miss Nancy. She is also a powerful ruler.                                     Orion: So you want me to “summon” you next time we're on a mission? We'll probably be playing again tomorrow.                                                                                           Calypso: Yes. I mean... no. I will come to you. Tomorrow is good. I will prepare.                   Orion: Cool! Let's do that.                                                                         Calypso: Yes. Cool. I will see you tomorrow then. If that is all, I shall be on my way. Farewell,   Orion.                                                                                              Informal farewell                                                                                   Orion: Sounds good! Can't wait to team up with my favorite elven princess! High-five!               Calypso: . . .                                                                                      Orion: . . . (Too soon.)                                                                            Formal farewell                                                                                     Orion: *Bowing down* For the greater good of Hyril'ar, I pledge to lay my life down for my Princess and satisfy each one of her desires.                                                                Calypso: Hmph.                                                                                      Orion: (That “hmph” sounded more playful than the angry ones of before. I'll take this as an elven  gesture of approval. Well, time to get back to the real world. Can't wait to tell the girls that I  got the Gem! 2 in my pocket... just 8 more to go!) *Removing your E-Visor* (Ah, that sound... I kind of missed Kredon's rain. As long as you stay indoors, it's the best feeling in the world.)         Dalia: Orion?! Orion!                                                                               Orion: Hey Dalia!                                                                                   Dalia: He's back!                                                                                   Penelope: Orion! How did it go?                                                                     Orion: I–                                                                                           Nancy: Orion?! What's the mission status?                                                           Orion: Well, I–                                                                                     Annie: Orion! *Popping in from between Nancy's thighs* And?!                                        Nancy: Did you get it?                                                                              Orion: I–                                                                                           Annie: Oh no, he killed you, right?! I knew you shouldn't have gone alone!                          Dalia: Why aren't you saying anything?!                                                             Annie: Because he died!                                                                             Penelope: Oh, really??                                                                              Nancy: Oh god, I SENT HIM TO HIS DEATH!                                                             Orion: Okay, okay, calm down everyone... I HAVE IT! We got a second Gem of Doom, ladies!            Annie: *Gasps* Oh.                                                                                  Penelope: My.                                                                                       Dalia: Fucking.                                                                                     Nancy: God!                                                                                         Dalia: Goddammit, nice job, Orion!                                                                  Orion: *Giggles* Thanks!                                                                            Penelope: Oh my god, 2 Gems already, Mom!                                                           Nancy: I know! We're one step closer to becoming the CEOs of Ulysses!                               Penelope: Do you realize how famous we'll be? My Instagram account will blow up!                    Nancy: We'll never have to worry about money again!                                                 Orion: *Laughs* I thought our main goal now was to unravel the mystery of dead people existing in   Eternum and all that.                                                                               Nancy: Well, yeah, but we can do both things at the same time!                                      Penelope: I'll get invited to the most famous fashion shows in the world! Maybe they’ll even let me model!                                                                                              Nancy: I'll be able to send you to the best universities! And retire early! And travel! And...      Orion: *Chuckles* Fair enough.                                                                      Dalia: Wow, is this poster new?                                                                     Orion: (My god, did Dalia's ass get even bigger while I was in the UK? Or... rounder?)              Dalia: Orion?                                                                                       Orion: E-Eh? Ah! Yeah! I bought it a couple of days ago! They had a few options available, but I    chose this one because it had some of my favorite servers.                                          Dalia: I like it! We should go back to Ekabar soon. Ulysses just announced a new event called “The  Big Hunt” for next month! I can't miss it.                                                          Orion: Oh, I read about it on Clarence's laptop when I went to Nancy's office. Count me in!         Penelope: Personally, I'm looking forward to visiting Meiyo. I've seen a few concept art pieces and they look amazing. Plus I love feudal Japan.                                                        Dalia: Just be careful not to go there alone, sis. It's full of Yokais and high level enemies, it'd be dangerous for you.                                                                               Penelope: Excuse me? What do you mean by that? First of all, I'm sure Orion would be happy to play  with me.                                                                                            Orion: Definitely!                                                                                  Penelope: And secondly, my magic skills are becoming better and better everyday. I can easily defend myself with my magic skills. Luna taught me to summon basic fiends and I can already cast          restoration spells that amaze most players. Luna taught me to summon basic fiends and I can already cast decent destruction spells of ice and fire.                                                     Dalia: Yeah well, magic is pretty cool, but nothing beats a badass warrior with a big-ass sword. Or a sneaky gunslinger!                                                                                Penelope: The Lord of the Rings would have ended very differently if Sauron had a mage that could   cast fire meteors instead of so many useless melee orcs, you know?                                  Dalia: And Harry Potter would have ended way faster if Harry rocked a Colt M1911 under his cloak.   Penelope: Magic is better.                                                                          Dalia: Brawn is superior.                                                                           Penelope: No.                                                                                       Dalia: Yes. Orion?!                                                                                 Orion: Oh shit.                                                                                     Dalia: Settle this debate! What's better, magic or muscle?                                          Orion: You mean... in Eternum? Or in video games in general?                                        Dalia: Both!                                                                                        Orion: Um...                                                                                        Physicals                                                                                           Orion: I'll go with physical damage. Nothing beats a good ol' warrior on the frontline with a sniper covering them.                                                                                     Dalia: *Giggles* Mmm-hm.                                                                            Penelope: He just said it because he knows you're the one who needs the extra self-confidence, don't get so excited.                                                                                    Dalia: *Giggles* Mmm-hm.                                                                            Magic                                                                                               Orion: I'll go with magic damage. Nothing beats a good ol' spellcaster casting fire with a support  healing their wounds.                                                                               Penelope: *Giggles* Mmm-hm.                                                                         Dalia: Don't get so excited, he just said it because you're the noob player and you need the extra  motivation.                                                                                         Penelope: *Giggles* Mmm-hm.                                                                         Orion: *Laughs* (I missed this so much.)                                                            Nancy: So tell us Orion, how did Operation Wagner go?                                               Orion: Exactly as you planned! I used my powers and stole the Gem before he could even flinch. Then Calypso created a portal and I got out of there without a trace.                                    Nancy: Wonderful! I was a bit worried, but I'm glad to hear that everything went well. Wagner and   his last men barricaded themselves inside his bunker, but I left several units posted at all the    exits. There are no Exit Portals inside, so they'll have to come out eventually... especially now   that Wagner lost his Gem.                                                                           Orion: A good old-fashioned siege. A flawless plan. I expected no less from the WRE Empress herself!Nancy: *Chuckles* I'm just sorry we made you log into Eternum as soon as you got back.              Orion: No worries! I was looking forward to it. Honestly, I wouldn't even have left if I hadn't     already paid for my flight before coming to Kredon. I thought I'd be way more homesick. But well, at least it was nice to see my grandparents and a few friends.                                        Annie: How was your father?                                                                         Orion: Meh, you know how he is. He was either working or drinking at some pub. He barely noticed me. *Chuckles* I received more affection from Chang's parents when I went to see them. They even gave  me a bunch of food for Chang.                                                                       Annie: *Laughs* Yeah, Mr. and Mrs. Wong are great.                                                  Orion: To be honest, I ended up spending most of the time in Eternum putting Dalia's techniques into practice and trying to learn how to better control my powers. I'm glad to be back. So... well, I'm ready for our next mission, ma'am!                                                                  Nancy: Next mission? Your next mission is to get a solid 8-hours of shut-eye!                       Orion: What?!                                                                                       Nancy: You told me you didn't sleep one bit during the flight, so now you need to rest. How long    have you been awake?                                                                                Orion: Um... not more than... Okay, probably too long. Fair enough.                                 Penelope: No worries Orion, there's nothing important to do tonight. Dalia and I were planning on   watching a reality TV show and not much else. And I think Annie is playing with Nova.               Orion: Oh, is that so?                                                                              Annie: Yep! Nova was invited to a secret meeting by some mysterious philanthropist because of her   alter ego, “Delilah Warren”. We assume he might be a fan, but we'll see. *Muttering* Probably just  another server where I can't use my elemental magic, but anyway... I'm sure it'll be fun.           Orion: Oh damn, a secret meeting, huh? That sounds exciting! Very... *yawns* mmh-mysterious         indeed... Geez, I'd like to join, but I guess you're right... I should go to sleep.                 Dalia: I don't even know how you can hang on so long without sleeping. If I don't get a full night’s rest, I feel worn out all day.                                                                     Nancy: That's true, the day we discovered Thanatos's identity he spent more than 48 hours without   sleep, but he endured... Surprisingly well.                                                         Orion: (Oh my...) T-Thank you. Must be the excitement to play Eternum.                              Nancy: Yeah, that must be it. That's true, the day we discovered Thanatos's identity he spent more  than 48 hours without sleep, but he endured surprisingly well.                                      Dalia: Any plans scheduled for this weekend? Any lost Gem to be found?                              Nancy: Um... let me think... Apart from Thanatos and us, there's one Gem in possession of another   player, and my men found another 2 leads to investigate. The first one leads to the Andromeda       server, so I thought of going there with Annie to see what we can dig up. The second one leads to   Blackridge, which is a town in Frontier Trails – a role-play server set in the Wild West. Alex told me she knows the server, so she offered to look around the place tomorrow. Maybe you could join her, Orion.                                                                                             Orion: That sounds great! And good timing too. I'm supposed to pass by her new apartment tomorrow.  Or... at least, that's what I think. I sort of invited myself to see it.                            Nancy: Oh, she moved out of her parents' home already? That's bold.                                 Dalia: Yeah, I visited her yesterday! She got herself a pretty cool place, you'll see.              Orion: I can take the Eternum equipment with me and play from her house.                            Nancy: Sounds good. I know magic is blocked in that server, so maybe you'd like to join too, Dalia? Dalia: *Standing up* I was hoping you'd say that! If that Gem is there, we'll find it!              Penelope: Wow, how come you don’t get this excited when you're playing with your beloved sister? Is it because of Alex or Orion?                                                                        Dalia: *Snorts* It's because you're not gonna be there bothering me. *Snorts* I enjoy Alex's company way more, yes.                                                                                     Penelope: Come on... you know you love playing with your big sis.                                   Dalia: You're dreaming!                                                                             Nancy: Alright then, tomorrow is settled! Now we really should let Orion sleep, though. We’ve       bothered him enough. Everyone out!                                                                  Penelope: Night night, Orion!                                                                       Dalia: See ya tomorrow!                                                                             Annie: Good night!!                                                                                 Orion: Goodnight, girls!                                                                            Nancy: Rest well, sweetie.                                                                          Orion: Thanks Nancy! Good night!                                                                    Nancy: I'll take a shower in the downstairs bathroom, no worries. I don’t want to keep you up.      Flirt                                                                                               Orion: Well... if it’s for the right reasons, I wouldn’t mind at all... You sure you don't want some company in there?                                                                                  Nancy: Right now? With Penelope, Dalia, and Annie in the house?                                     Orion: Well, they can join if they want too.                                                        Nancy: *Snorts* Of course you’d say that! I'm afraid I'll have to shower alone today, my insatiable stud.                                                                                               Orion: That's too bad... give me a call if you change your mind.                                    Nancy: *Giggles* Sweet dreams, Orion...                                                             Orion: See you tomorrow, Nancy... (Hot damn... She drives me crazy. I love it.)                     Thank her                                                                                           Orion: Thank you! I appreciate it.                                                                  Nancy: Sweet dreams, Orion.                                                                         Orion: See you tomorrow! (Man, I missed being with them so much. Man, I missed being with them so   much.) *Lying down* Ahhh... *Yawns* (If I have to be honest, I didn't realize how long I’d been     awake until they mentioned it. I feel like I have more endurance since I came to the USA, for some  reason. Must be Kredon's fresh air. But anyway, stronger or not, I still have to sleep. I'm supposed to meet Alex tomorrow morning and go see her new apartment. I'm sure she must be happy to finally  have left the family home. And that Wild West server promises to be...) *Yawns* (Very... Very, very fun....) Mmmm... *Shivering* (Fuck, why is it so cold in here? Did I leave my window open?)         *Standing up* Hmm...? (What...? Where am I? What is this place? Am I having a lucid dream? Hmm, that would be a first. I hardly ever dream in the first place.)                                         A lantern suddenly lights up at the end of the balustrade, revealing a woman sitting on top of a    column.                                                                                             Orion: (Wait, is that... Idriel? Oh god, now I'm dreaming about Eternum too. I'm way too            obsessed...) Um... hello?                                                                           . . .                                                                                               Orion: Idriel?                                                                                      Idriel: Do you fear death, Orion?                                                                   Orion: What?                                                                                        Idriel: Do you fear... death?                                                                       Orion: Um... no?                                                                                    Idriel: Do you crave it, then?                                                                      Orion: God, not that either. I just... I never think about it, to be honest.                        Idriel: Many people fear it.                                                                        Orion: Well, I guess it's natural. But I also think that accepting it is the better approach,       whenever it comes. Everyone dies after all. F-Fuck!                                                 Idriel: Everyone dies. And yet... people fear it. Why?                                              Orion: Um...                                                                                        Idriel: Do you know what's scarier than dying, Orion?                                               Loneliness                                                                                          Orion: Loneliness?                                                                                  Darkness                                                                                            Orion: Darkness?                                                                                    Failure                                                                                             Orion: Failure?                                                                                     Idriel: Being unable to die.                                                                        Orion: Unable to die?                                                                               Idriel: Without death, life has no meaning. Without choice, we lose what makes us human. He feared  it. That's why only you can help us.                                                                Orion: Eh... I'm afraid I'm not following you.                                                      Idriel: You must keep moving forward, Orion. You must help them. Only you can.                      Orion: Who's “them”?                                                                                Idriel: We're still on the right path. We still have time. We still have a chance. But you must keep moving forward.                                                                                    Orion: What path?! You're not making any fucking sense, speak clearly!                              Idriel: That would be pointless. You won't remember anyway.                                         Orion: Of course I will!                                                                            Idriel: Keep moving forward, Orion. Don't look back. Break. The. Chain.                             Orion: (What the fuck... Agghh... my head... Fuck, that was an incredibly vivid dream. Hmph, now    where... Wait a second, is that an Exit Portal? Oh shit, don't tell me I fell asleep with the E-suit on... I must have logged into Eternum while sleeping.)                                             Annie: Look, the girl went inside.                                                                  Nova: Oh my god, I know her! She's Harley Jones!                                                    Orion: *Turning around* Huh...?                                                                     Annie: Harley Jones?                                                                                Nova: You don't know her? She's like, the most famous hitwoman in Eternum!                          Annie: Oh no...                                                                                     Nova: No worries, she just kills under contract. I heard she's cool when she's not on the job.      Annie: Oh, good.                                                                                    Nova: Should we go inside?                                                                          Orion: Um... Annie? Nova?                                                                           Annie: AAAAARGH! Orion...? What are you doing here?!                                                Orion: *Laughs* Okay, this is a bit embarrassing. I think I fell asleep with the Eternum suit and   E-visor on, and the system logged me in by mistake. *Chuckles* I know sometimes I talk in my sleep, so I wouldn't be surprised if I even managed to respond to the AI voice.                            Nova: . . .                                                                                         Annie: . . .                                                                                        Orion: Are you okay...?                                                                             Annie: Why are you... I mean... You're... You're kind of naked.                                     Orion: *Gazing down at yourself* Huh? W-What the fuck?! W-Why am I naked? *Turning around* Oh shit, is it because this server doesn't have a default outfit?                                            Nova: Y-You probably skipped the Main Nexus and forgot to select an outfit from your inventory.     Annie: D-Do you have anything you can wear?                                                         Orion: Yeah, I think I have something here. Sorry about that.                                       Annie: I-It's okay. It's just... that... well, I was shocked at first since we had never seen each  other naked, and all that. B-But, don't worry.                                                      Nova: Y-Yeah, same here. A bit striking because I never saw you naked before either. I mean... n-not that I was expecting to ever see you naked... erm... y-you know what I mean.                       Annie: Y-Yeah! Same. I-It's okay!                                                                   Nova: I-It's okay!                                                                                  Orion: Alright, ready! This will do, I guess. I don't have anything more formal right now.          Annie: You look good!                                                                               Nova: So good!                                                                                      Orion: Well, I can't compare to you two. You look incredible, those outfits are just as elegant as  they are sexy.                                                                                      Nova: *Giggles* Thank you! I've gotta ask, though, how could you access this server? Did I also send you an invite by mistake?                                                                          Orion: Maybe? I honestly don't remember, I just went to sleep and then... I “woke up” here.         Annie: Oh, that happened to me once. I fell asleep with the E-suit on and I woke up at the main     Nexus. Idriel was just there staring at me, asking me which server I wanted to visit.               Orion: *Laughs* I'm glad I'm not alone. I guess I should probably leave, though. I don't wanna be a hindrance.                                                                                          Nova: No, no, please, stay! I'm actually glad you're here. I feel safer.                            Orion: Really? Well, alright then! Although... I'm not sure what we're supposed to do here. Annie   mentioned it, but didn't go into details.                                                           Nova: Basically, I received a private message addressed to Delilah Warren, inviting me to the house of Gideon Cook tonight.                                                                             Annie: I didn't know him, but apparently Gideon Cook is a famous Eternum collector. They said he    brought together artifacts from more than 100 different servers. His collection is worth millions of eternals! People usually just call him “The Collector”.                                            Orion: I see... And what does he want from Ms. Warren? Maybe he wants Dione for his collection?     Nova: Hah! I'd like to see him try! I saw more people entering the house, so it seems I wasn't the  only person invited.                                                                                Orion: Uh, sounds thrilling! What are we waiting for, then? Let's go inside!                        Nova: Well, we were trying to do some recon before going in, just in case it happened to be a trap  of some sort.                                                                                       Orion: That's smart.                                                                                Nova: But now that you're here, we have nothing to fear! You go first! Dione and I will be covering your back!                                                                                          Orion: *Chuckles* Alright, fair enough. Let's see what this is all about.                           Nova: We’ll follow you!                                                                             Orion: Hmm... Fancy place.                                                                          Nova: We're in the Rockefeller server, so I'd be more surprised if a house here didn't look fancy.  Orion: Oh, the same server where I met the Founder?                                                 Annie: Yep! All rich people have a mansion or two here.                                             Orion: We'll have one someday too.                                                                  Annie: *Laughs* I'll take your word for it! Look, there's a stroller with some luggage over there.  Maybe this is some sort of hotel?                                                                   Orion: Mmm, it could also be a vacation home. It gives me those vibes. I hear voices coming from the inside. They must be waiting for us.                                                               Nova: Okay! Let me go first. I'm the one who was invited, so I guess I should be the one introducing you both.                                                                                          Orion: Fair enough.                                                                                 Nova: *Taking a deep breath* Okay, Delilah. Act cool, confident... *cracks knuckles* badass.        As you enter the building, the few people who were speaking suddenly go silent, and everyone in the hall stares at you.                                                                                 Orion: (Damn, these people look so... different from each other. Is “The Collector” one of them?)   ???: Well, well, well... I guess we're all here now. I'm glad to see people my age. These boomers   are a total bore.                                                                                   Orion: Hello! I'm Orion, nice to meet you.                                                          Harley Jones: Pleased to meet you, Orion. I'm Harley.                                               ???: So, you're the last ones? Can we finally learn why we were all gathered here? I have things to do. I can't stay here all night, you know.                                                          Nova: I don't know why we're here either, I guess we all received the same–                         Annie: W-What happened?                                                                             ???: Looks like the lights went out. Fantastic deduction there, Sherlock.                           Orion: Stay behind me...                                                                            ???: Fuck, I knew I shouldn't have come. What the hell...                                           Clonk: Hello everyone! My name is Clonk, and I am very pleased to meet you all. Welcome to the Cook guesthouse!                                                                                         Harley Jones: Is this robot talking?                                                                Clonk: Indeed, I am! Very perceptive of you, Ms. Jones. I am one of Mr. Cook's artifacts. I've been a proud part of his collection for 4 years now, after he bought me at an auction in the Red Herring server. This house holds the best pieces of Mr. Cook's collection. Most artifacts look like normal  items, but be careful! Don't touch anything if you don't want any unpleasant surprises!             ???: So... Gideon Cook sent us all invitations to his storehouse? Why?                              Orion: (Good lord almighty! Now that’s what I call cleavage! I should pick up my jaw and look away  before Nova or Annie notice me staring, though...)                                                  Annie: *Whispering* Wow, have you seen the milk melons on her?!                                     Nova: *Whispering* I know! I was thinking the same thing! She’s never going to have to worry about  drowning, that’s for sure.                                                                          Orion: (Nevermind.)                                                                                 ???: Is he gonna show up or...?                                                                     Clonk: He indeed invited you all, Ms. Piaget. Unfortunately, I will be your host tonight, on behalf of Mr. Cook.                                                                                        ???: And why didn't he come himself?                                                                Clonk: Good question. One that has a very simple explanation. You see, Master Gideon, The Collector, can't be here tonight because... He was murdered last week.                                        ???: Gideon Cook is... dead?                                                                        Clonk: Correct! In fact, you've been gathered here to decide who will inherit one of Mr. Gideon's   possessions. An item of your choice!                                                                ???: What do you mean, “decide”? We have to choose who gets to take one artifact?                   Clonk: Indeed! Each one of you made a name for yourself in Eternum in one way or another. Master    Gideon thought you all deserved to be the heir to one of his artifacts because of that. But...      there's a catch. Someone amongst your ranks... is an impostor. One of you... Is the person who      murdered Gideon Cook. Using his wits, and before the hemlock ended his life, Master Gideon quickly  discovered who the murderer was. Far from any feeling of rancor, he admired the ambition and        tenacity of his killer. So then, he decided to design one last puzzle game before his Eternum       account and inventory were lost to the endless depths of cyberspace forever. Every 10 minutes, each one of you has to vote for the person who you think is the murderer. At the end of each round, the  person with the most votes will be eliminated. If you successfully eliminate the murderer, you win, and all the remaining players will be able to choose an artifact of their choice. If you don't      eliminate the murderer, the game will continue onto the next round. If there are only two people    left, and one of them is the murderer, the murderer wins the game and they can take an artifact with them.                                                                                              ???: A game of intellect. Sounds fairly appealing.                                                  Clonk: To kick things off, I do believe introductions are in order. Please take this time to become acquainted with one another. Afterwards, the game will begin. Good luck and have fun!               Harley Jones: Okay, okay, I'll start! Hi everyone, my name is Harley Jones, and I didn't even know  who Gideon Cook was before coming here, so... I'm obviously not the murderer.                       Clonk: Please, Ms. Jones, refrain from discussing the murder victim until after the presentations   have been completed.                                                                                Harley Jones: Oh, sorry Clonky, of course. Where was I... Ah yes, I'm Harley Jones. And I guess I   don't need to say much... my reputation speaks for itself. I'm the best hitwoman in all of Eternum. The only way to defeat me is catching me off guard while I'm sleeping, and since I’m the queen of   #TeamNoSleep in Eternum... GG!                                                                      ???: Hitwoman? Sounds like the perfect suspect to be the murderer.                                  Harley Jones: I'd never use such a lame method as poison, but thanks for your concern, dear holy    Pope.                                                                                               ???: Very well, I'll introduce myself next, then. I am Anna Piaget.                                 Anna Piaget: I'm one of the most renowned psychologists in the world. I have dozens of published    works and I'm capable of diagnosing any kind of mental illness or insecurity within a person after  talking to them for a minute. And of course... to provide them with the proper treatment.           ???: I am Gemini, or as some people call me... the Blind Oracle.                                    Gemini: After losing my sight and legs as a kid, I developed a new ability. I am capable of seeing  the future.                                                                                         Orion: (The future? Like Luna?) Um... If I may ask... how can you do that? Do you do that through   your sense of touch, or...?                                                                         Gemini: My visions come and go. I can't know when they will come, or what they'll be about.         Orion: (Hmm, seems different from hers.)                                                            Gemini: Unfortunately, Eternum can't heal my physical state, but my mental abilities remain intact. ???: I'm Sister Baek.                                                                               Sister Baek: I am the leader of the Church of Unitology in the server of Andromeda. I can feel the  presence of the people who have already left our mortal plane and sometimes... I can hear their     messages.                                                                                           Anna Piaget: So... a cult?                                                                          Sister Baek: A RELIGION. We unitologists adamantly believe that Eternum was created by the          intelligent design of a divine alien agency, and all humanity will be reunified after death in a    sacred server.                                                                                      Harley Jones: *Coughs* Coo-coo!                                                                     Orion: (Mmm... considering what we discovered at Thanatos' house... that somehow doesn't seem so    far-fetched.)                                                                                       Nova: *Profusely clears her throat* AHEM! I guess it's my turn now. My name is...                   Harley Jones: Wait, wait, wait, what about these two? Why are you hiding in that corner?            Orion: Um... well, I didn't think we had to introduce ourselves. I'm Orion, but... Technically we   weren't invited by Gideon Cook, we just came with No–                                               Annie: *Clears throat* Hmmph!                                                                       Orion: ...NO one else except for Delilah.                                                           Harley Jones: What?! That's cheating!                                                               Nova: How is that cheating? The invitation didn't mention I couldn't bring anyone with me!          Harley Jones: Yes it did!                                                                           Nova: No, it didn't, you dumbo! Actually, I still have the invitation here with me, so you can see  for yourself and then shut up about it. *Reading out loud* Dear Delilah Warren, my name is Gideon   Cook, and I am pleased to offer you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. You must come alone to the– . . . Oh. *Nervous giggle* Okay, I might have missed that bit.                                        Harley Jones: Cheater!                                                                              Clonk: Fear not, Ms. Jones. Even if Ms. Warren infringed that rule, her companions can't vote in the game, so your chances of winning are not lessened by any means.                                    Nova: See? No need to make a fuss about it, drama queen.                                            Harley Jones: I'll let it slide for now, but I'm keeping an eye on you, ginger girl. You're sussy!  Nova: Okay, okay, whatever... Anyway... as I was saying, my name is Delilah Warren. You'll recognize my name because, as it's publicly known, I'm in possession of one of the three Weapons of Atlas,   Dione. My marksmanship is perfect, and I've never missed a shot in my life. . . .                   Annie: Great introduction, Delilah! So badass!                                                      Nova: *Giggles* Y-You really think so?! Thanks, Annie!                                              ???: *Clears throat* And I am... Elliot Cook.                                                       Elliot Cook: I... eh... I'm a taxi driver in New York.                                              Anna Piaget: You're sweating like a racehorse, Elliot. I assume it's just a psychosomatic effect of the anxiety you're going through right now. Hiding anything?                                        Sister Baek: And... did you say you're a taxi driver? That's all? Everyone here stands out for      something. Why would The Collector have invited you otherwise?                                      Gemini: I'm sorry, but it seems like no one is pointing out the obvious thing here. Did you say     you're Elliot... Cook? Are you related in any way to Mr. Gideon Cook?                               Elliot Cook: Erm... He... Yes, he was my father.                                                    Sister Baek: What?! The Collector was your father?                                                  Harley Jones: *Laughs* HAHAHA! So in sum, this dude killed his own pops and showed up at the reading of his will expecting to cash out... just to find a bunch of strangers and a game his daddy        organized before dying simply to humiliate him! *Laughs* Now I've seen everything!                  Elliot Cook: Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop there kiddo, I haven't killed anyone! My father and I stopped   talking years ago! He was so fucking obsessed with Eternum and his artifacts that he ended up       abandoning my mother and forgetting he had a son. I was just as surprised to receive that letter as all of you.                                                                                         Sister Baek: So you killed him out of spite?                                                        Anna Piaget: He probably expected to be his father's only heir, so he killed him after discovering  how much his Eternum collection was worth.                                                          Gemini: Greed is definitely one of the most hideous sins in this world, no doubt.                   Harley Jones: *Laughs* You've gotta be the worst killer ever!                                       Elliot Cook: I said I didn't kill anyone! I... You know what? Fuck you! I don't give a shit about   you bunch of retards. I'm going out for a smoke. You can all open up your gigantic mouths and gobble on my big hairy balls. There’s room for all of you shitheads!                                      Anna Piaget: I was honestly expecting this to be a bit more challenging. Can we vote already, robot?Clonk: You have 10 minutes to decide your vote, ma'am. Just get back to me when you've decided!     Harley Jones: Well, since the game is pretty much over, I'm gonna go take a walk around the house to decide what artifact I want to take home. See you in 10 minutes!                                   Orion: Well... Seems like all clues point to Elliot Cook, The Collector's son.                      Nova: Yes, but... I don't know, it all seems way too easy. I feel like the actual killer wouldn’t be sweating like a pig and giving himself away so easily, don’t you think? If you ask me, I'd say     there's something fishy here.                                                                       Annie: Yeah, I think so too... my Sherlock Holmes-ian senses are tingling. I don't trust any of     these people. I feel like someone is lying...                                                       Orion: Those were exactly my thoughts. I think one of them is hiding things from us and is running  some sort of con. Let's take a walk around the house before voting. Maybe if we find some clue or   catch anyone in their lie we can unravel this mystery.                                              Nova: Exciting! You can count on us!                                                                Annie: Don't worry Orion, you and your two deputies will unravel the mystery of Cook's manor!       Orion: *Chuckles* I couldn't have asked for better assistants. Let's do this!                       Annie: Hey, check out the reception... there's a bunch of little drawers and different keys over    there. Maybe the one that opens that locked door we found is among them?                            Orion: Hmm, it's worth checking it out...                                                           Clonk: Welcome back, Ms. Warren! Are you ready to cast a vote?                                      Nova: Actually, I'm gonna delegate Orion as my voter. We're a team, so... I'll let him make the     final decision. Is that okay?                                                                       Clonk: Of course, that is no problem at all. Just keep in mind that the other guests might still    vote for you to be eliminated, not Mr. Orion.                                                       Nova: Sure, that makes sense.                                                                       Clonk: Thank you for your understanding.                                                            Orion: Can I ask what your relationship with The Collector was exactly, Clonk? Were you like... his butler or something?                                                                                Clonk: Oh, I held a much lesser role. I just used to watch the guesthouse and helped him keep the   inventory of his artifacts in order. Unfortunately, the low mobility of my arms prevents me from    carrying out simple tasks such as cleaning or serving tea, so I'm not fit to be a butler.           Annie: Aaaaaw, look how cute he is when he's sad! Don't worry Clonk, I'm sure he was proud of you!  Be nice to Clonk                                                                                    Orion: Yeah, Annie's right, you seem like a great servant, Clonk. You should be proud of yourself.  Annie: Well said!                                                                                   Orion: (Trying to cheer up a depressed robot is certainly not one of the things I thought I'd be    doing in Eternum a few months ago.)                                                                 Clonk: You're too nice, Mr. Orion!                                                                  Orion: *Chuckles* Don't mention it. And you can call me Mr. Richards, if you want.                  Clonk: With pleasure! Alright then, tell me Mr. Richards, are you ready to cast your vote and       advance to the next round?                                                                          Be rude to Clonk                                                                                    Orion: Sounds like a skill issue. Now that The Collector is dead I guess you'll be scrapped for     parts or something? Maybe melted down to create something more useful? You’d probably make a badass coffee mug.                                                                                         Annie: Orion, don't be rude to Clonk!                                                               Clonk: Probably yes... But that won't stop me from conducting my final task! I'll fulfill my        master's last wishes and complete his last game! So... tell me sir, are you ready to vote and       advance to the next round?                                                                          Orion: You can call me Mr. Richards, and...                                                         Clonk: Hello again sir! Are you ready for the first vote? Hello again sir! Ready to vote?           Vote                                                                                                Orion: Um... I guess.                                                                               Annie: Orion!                                                                                       Orion: Annie! Thank god you're not invisible anymore. Please, tell me you found a clue about who's  the murderer.                                                                                       Annie: Uh... I-I didn't, I'm sorry.                                                                 Orion: Oh god, we're fucked... (Fuck, I'm sweating so much that the others will think we're the     impostors... If I don't get this right, the murderer will win the game and we'll get lasered. This  is my last chance...)

Clonk: Excellent! Tell me then, who killed Mr. Gideon Cook?                                         Harley Jones, the hitwoman                                                                          Orion: Harley Jones.

Nova: Um... excuse me? You did not just vote for me. What the hell, Orion?!                         Orion: Don't worry, it's all part of the strategy! I'm pretty sure no one else will vote for you,   and I want to know who voted for who.

Nova: What?! What the fuck, Orion, this is the last round!                                          Orion: Trust me, it's all part of my plan...

Nova: Um... excuse me? You did not just vote for me. What the hell, Orion?!                         Orion: Don't worry, it's all part of the strategy! I'm pretty sure no one else will vote for you,   and I want to know who voted for who.                                                               Nova: Hmph, you better know what you're doing...                                                    Clonk: Thank you for your vote, sir. With this, the second round has reached its end. With this, the third round has reached its end. With this, the final round has reached its end. May I have your   attention! Everyone please return to the main hall! The final round is over!                        The remaining players come back to the hall and nervously tell their vote to Clonk. Everybody comes back to the hall and discreetly tells their vote to Clonk, one after the other.                     Nova: Oh dear, I'm so dizzy...                                                                      Orion: Nova! You're back to normal! Are you okay?                                                   Nova: Yeah, more or less. I suddenly reverted back into a single body after a while. Now I'm just a little woozy. I won't touch anything else, I swear.                                                 Orion: Don't worry, I'm glad to see full Nova back. The important thing right now is that we get out of here alive. Have you seen Annie?                                                                Nova: I think so? Or at least I heard her voice. She told me she was heading somewhere to find      something.                                                                                          Orion: So she's still invisible.                                                                    Nova: She told me she was heading to the garden to find a box or something and she'd join us ASAP.  Orion: Ah, I'm relieved. Well, let's hear the result of the vote, hopefully this one was the last   round!                                                                                              Nova: Yes! Let's hope so!                                                                           Clonk: Thank you all for your cooperation! The final results of the vote are as follows!            Orion: *Gulps* (The moment of truth.)                                                               Clonk: Anna Piaget... 1 vote. Sister Baek... 1 vote. Gemini... 1 vote. Harley Jones... 2 votes.

Gemini: Hold on a second, WHAT?! You voted for... ME?! Are you all retarded?! It's so fucking       obvious that it's Sister Baek, for fuck's sake! How did you let her fool you?!                      Sister Baek: We caught you, Gemini. Accept it already.                                              Harley Jones: *Hysterical laugh* I bet you didn't see this coming in your visions, eh?!             Gemini: You bunch of idiots! How can you be so fu–                                                  Harley Jones: O-Okay! It's done! We won! Right?!                                                    Clonk: I'm afraid not, Ms. Jones. I must announce that Gemini was actually NOT the murderer!        Gemini... 2 votes. Sister Baek... 3 votes. Which means that... Sister Baek has been eliminated from the game!                                                                                           Sister Baek: Hold on, hold on, hold on! This is a joke, RIGHT?! I'm a respectable leader of         Eternum's community! I had no reason to kill The Collector!                                         Gemini: I'm afraid the vote has already ended, Sister.                                              Sister Baek: O-Okay! I lost! Haha! I'll leave! OKAY?! I'll leave the server.                        Anna Piaget: That's not how this works, Baek.                                                       Sister Baek: Okay! OKAY! I'll leave the server so you can conti–                                    Anna Piaget: So... is it done? Did we win?                                                          Clonk: I'm afraid not, Ms. Piaget. I must announce that Sister Baek was actually NOT the murderer!  Delilah Warren... 1 vote. Sister Baek... 2 votes. Gemini... 2 votes. So... oh! We have a tie! Which means that both Gemini and Sister Baek have been eliminated from the game!                          Gemini: Hold on a second, WHAT?! You voted for... ME?! Are you all retarded?!                       Harley Jones: *Hysterical laugh* I bet you didn't see this coming in your visions, eh?!             Sister Baek: T-This is a joke, RIGHT?! I'm a respectable leader of Eternum's community! I had no    reason to kill The Collector!

How can you be so fu–                                                  Harley Jones: O-Okay! It's done! We won! Right?!                                                    Clonk: I'm afraid not, Ms. Jones. I must announce that Gemini and Sister Baek were actually NOT the murderers! Neither of them! Which means that the true killer is still hiding among you and we will  proceed to Round 3! Good luck!                                                                      Harley Jones: WHAT?! Please, not again! *Hyperventilating* I can't continue, my anxiety is gonna    kill me before the laser does! You're all lying to me! YOU'RE ALL LIARS! AND WHY ARE YOU ALONE?!    Where's Delilah and the other girl?!                                                                Orion: Um...                                                                                        Harley Jones: DECEIVER! I should have never come here...                                            Anna Piaget: I see none of you can be trusted. You better stay away from me. All of you.            Orion: (Oh god... What have we got ourselves into...)                                               Clonk: Harley Jones... 1 vote. Anna Piaget... 1 vote. Elliot Cook... 4 votes.

Anna Piaget... 1 vote. Elliot     Cook... 5 votes. Anna Piaget... 1 vote. Delilah Warren... 1 vote. Elliot Cook... 4 votes. That is   all.                                                                                                Anna Piaget: Well, I guess there were no surprises.                                                 Harley Jones: *Laughs* HAHA! Good try, Elliot.                                                      Elliot Cook: Fuck you all! I'm glad this shit is finally over. Okay robot, these morons voted for   me. Can you tell them that I'm not the fucking murderer already? I wanna see their stupid faces.    Clonk: One step at a time, Mr. Cook! First of all, you must be retired from the game, since you were just eliminated!                                                                                   Elliot Cook: *Sighs* Fine, can I leave already, then? Or do I have to sta–                          Orion: W-What the fuck...                                                                           Harley Jones: W-W-W-Wha-aat...? D-Did he just get f-fucking laser beamed from the c-ceiling?        Clonk: That is correct, Ms. Jones. This entire house and its gardens are equipped with deadly lasers capable of neutralizing any possible thieves, or in this case... eliminated players!               Sister Baek: WHAT?! So if we lose... we DIE?!                                                       Clonk: Those were the instructions of Mr. Gideon, yes! And that's not all! I must announce that     Elliot Cook was actually NOT the murderer! Which means that the true killer is still hiding among   you and we must continue to Round 2! Good luck!                                                     Sister Baek: Are you kidding me?! I'm not losing everything I have because of this, I'm out!        Clonk: I am afraid that will not be possible, Ms. Baek. You must stay in the house or a laser will  eliminate you, whether you're playing as an innocent person or as the killer.                       Sister Baek: What? You're all crazy!                                                                Anna Piaget: I guess that now is when the true game really starts... Interesting.                   Gemini: That was an unexpected turn of events...                                                    Harley Jones: F-Fuck this shit, I'm getting away from you all before you stab me in the back! You're all a bunch of liars!                                                                              Clonk: And Round 2 has started! You have 10 minutes to decide your vote! Good luck!                 Orion: (What the actual fuck...) O-Okay, that was... something unexpected, for sure. *Taking a deep breath* But we need to stay calm and keep cool heads. We're cleverer than any of these people. If we analyze the clues and carefully speak to each of them, I'm sure we'll be able to narrow it down and figure out who the actual murderer is. I promise you this: none of us will be dying tonight. So    chin up! Better?                                                                                    Annie: *Nodding* Mhm! Mhm!                                                                          Nova: *Nodding* Mhm! Mhm!                                                                           Orion: Now let's crack this damn case!                                                              Annie: *Nodding* Mhm! Mhm!                                                                          Nova: *Nodding* Mhm! Mhm!                                                                           Annie: Hey, check out the reception... there's a bunch of little drawers and different keys over    there. Maybe the one that opens that door is among them?                                            Orion: Hmm, it's worth checking it out...                                                           Clonk: Which means that... Harley Jones has been eliminated from the game!                          Harley Jones: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! GOOD JOKE, CLONK! I ALMOST BELIEVED IT!                             Clonk: I'm afraid it's not a joke, Ms. Jones.                                                       Harley Jones: YES IT IS, BECAUSE I'M NOT THE IMPOSTOR! I CAN'T DIE! NO, I CAN'T! I'M THE BEST       HITWOMAN IN ALL OF ETERNUM! I'M HARLEY JO–                                                          Orion: I-Is it over...? Did we win?                                                                 Clonk: Ah, I'm afraid not! I must announce that Harley Jones was actually NOT the murderer! Which   means that... Anna Piaget has been eliminated from the game!                                        Anna Piaget: W-Wait, wait, wait... E-Excuse me? Did I hear that right? Y-You surely didn't vote for me, DID YOU?!                                                                                       Clonk: It seems like they did, Ms. Piaget.                                                          Anna Piaget: It has to be a mistake! I didn't kill anyone! How can you vote for me! Only I can solve this case, I'm way more clever than any of you! I'M WAY MORE BEAUTIFUL! I cannot–                  Orion: I-Is it over...? Did we win?                                                                 Clonk: Ah, I'm afraid not! I must announce that Anna Piaget was actually NOT the murderer! Which    means that... Sister Baek has been eliminated from the game!                                        Sister Baek: Hold on, hold on, hold on! This is a joke, RIGHT?! I'm a respectable leader of         Eternum's community! I had no reason to kill The Collector!                                         Anna Piaget: Your fidgeting denotes a clear sense of culpability, Sister. It's over.                Sister Baek: I... O-Okay! I lost! You eliminated me! Haha! I'll leave! OKAY?! I'll leave the server.Anna Piaget: That's not how this works, Baek.                                                       Sister Baek: Okay! OKAY! I'll leave the server so you can conti–                                    Anna Piaget: So... is it done? Did we win?                                                          Orion: I-Is it done? Did we win?                                                                    Clonk: I'm afraid not, Ms. Piaget. Ah, I'm afraid not! I must announce that Sister Baek was actually NOT the murderer! Which means that... Gemini has been eliminated from the game!                    Gemini: Hold on a second, WHAT?! Two people voted... ME?! Are you retarded?! It's so fucking obvious that it's Sister Baek, for fuck's sake! How did you let her fool you?!                             Sister Baek: We caught you, Gemini. Accept it already.                                              Harley Jones: *Hysterical laugh* I bet you didn't see this coming in your visions, eh?!             Gemini: You bunch of idiots! How can you be so fu–                                                  Harley Jones: O-Okay! It's done! We won! Right?!                                                    Orion: I-Is it done? Did we win?                                                                    Clonk: I'm afraid not, Ms. Jones. Ah, I'm afraid not! I must announce that Gemini was actually NOT  the murderer! So... oh! We have a tie! Which means that all remaining players, innocent or not, have been eliminated from the game!                                                                     Orion: Oh. O-Okay, this wasn't part of the plan...                                                  Gemini: WHAT?!                                                                                      Nova: Fuck, Orion, what have you done?!                                                             Harley Jones: NO, NO, NO, I CAN'T DIE!                                                              Anna Piaget: It has to be a mistake!                                                                Sister Baek: This is a joke, RIGHT?!                                                                Clonk: It's certainly an unexpected turn of events, but rules are rules! Thank you for participating in Mr. Cook's last big riddle! It was a pleasure having you all here tonight.                      Nova: Wait, wait, wait, give us one last chance! Let's vote aga–                                    .  .  .  .  .                                                                                       Orion: *Muttering* Ughhhh... (This fucking headache again...) *Looking around* (Where... Where the  hell am I? An Exit Portal...?) N-Nova?!                                                             You check your inventory and, to your relief, see that the Gems of Doom and the rest of your        belongings are still with you.                                                                      Orion: (Phew, thank god. But I don't understand, how did I...) *Grabbing your head* F-Fuck, my      head... *Grumbling* (Wait... Could it be because of... The amulet of Blair, of course! “No matter   what happens to your body, you cannot die in Eternum if you have this amulet in your inventory”...  the Founder said it himself. Huh, I guess it really works after all. But... something feels off. It gives me... a strange sensation.) *Grumbling* (Agh, anyway, I better get the fuck out of here before my head explodes... Let's go...) *Stretching* (Mmmm... still raining.) *Sitting up* (Oh, fucking   hell... I might have escaped, but... shit, Nova and Annie will be pissed off.)                      .  .  .  .  .                                                                                       Orion: *Sitting up* Oh, fucking hell! (Goddammit, I really screwed the pooch this time! Unless...   Annie wasn't there when the lasers killed us. Maybe she was spared? Annie wasn't hit by the         lasers... I think. Maybe she was spared?) *Lying down* (I guess I'll have to wait for her to log    off. Please, be fine... I don't want to have to tell the others that I lost our 2 Gems...           Please...)                                                                                          Annie: Orion?                                                                                       Orion: *Sitting up* Annie! Finally! Come on in!                                                     Annie: Orion! W-What happened?                                                                      Orion: I could survive thanks to the artifact the Founder gave me. I-I still have the Gems! What    about you?! Are you okay?                                                                           Annie: Y-Yeah. I came back to the main hall and Clonk said I could retrieve whatever I needed from  your inventories... although yours was empty. He said that since I wasn't there when the game ended, I was allowed to leave. Y-Yeah. Since I wasn't either Delilah or the person to whom she gave her   voting power, Clonk said I was allowed to retrieve whatever I needed from your inventories and      leave... although yours was empty.                                                                  Orion: T-The Gems! Do you have them?                                                                Annie: Y-Yeah. I came back to the main hall and Clonk said I could retrieve whatever I needed from  your inventories. That since I wasn't there when the game ended, I was allowed to leave. Y-Yeah.    Since I wasn't either Delilah or the person to whom she gave her voting power, Clonk said I was     allowed to retrieve whatever I needed from your inventories and leave.                              Orion: *Sigh of relief* Oof, thank god! I was so scared! What about Dione?                          Annie: Yeah, I have it too. But... what happened?! The scenario was completely... deceitful.        Orion: Yeah, I can imagine... Um... well, the thing is that I voted for Nova thinking no one else   would, and... I was right, but I didn't think of the possibility of a tie. I texted her, but she's  not responding. I'll try again tomorrow, she's probably worried about Dione.                        Annie: Y-You have to be careful! I'll send the Gems back to you tomorrow, but you have to be        careful! We got lucky this time, but we don't know what will happen in the future!                  Orion: I-I know, I'm sorry. (She's quite right indeed. I have to be more careful...)                Annie: *Sighs* Anyway, at least we didn't lose our inventories. I'll go take a headache tablet and  try to sleep a bit.                                                                                 Orion: Oh, is it too bad?                                                                           Annie: No, I'll guess it's just because of the stress. I'll feel better tomorrow, I hope. Good      night, Orion.                                                                                       Orion: Good night, Annie! And sorry again for what I made you go through.                           Annie: It's okay...                                                                                 Orion: *Lying down* (Fuck, that was close. I can't keep being so sloppy, there are too many things  at stake right now. But anyway, what's done is done... I hope things go more smoothly tomorrow at   the Western server.) . . . (Somehow I highly doubt it...)                                           Harley Jones: WHAT?!                                                                                Orion: You?!                                                                                        Harley Jones: *Hyperventilating* Y-You were the impostor the whole time?!                           Orion: ME?! Come on, stop acting!                                                                   Harley Jones: Fuck, I KNEW IT!                                                                      Orion: I can't believe you're the murderer!                                                         Harley Jones: I'm not the murderer, YOU ARE!                                                        Orion: WHAT?! You are!                                                                              Anna Piaget: *Gasps* No way... YOU?! You're the fucking impostor?!                                  Orion: What?! It was you?!                                                                          Anna Piaget: Oh my god, of course... those awkward attempts to rationalize your behavior... it all  makes sense now!                                                                                    Orion: Come on, stop acting! I can't believe you're the murderer!                                   Anna Piaget: I'm not the murderer, YOU ARE!                                                         Orion: WHAT?! You are!                                                                              Sister Baek: FUCK!

Orion: What are you talking about?! Stop acting! I can't believe you tricked me!                    Sister Baek: Spare my life, please, a whole religion depends on me!                                 Orion: What? I'm not the murderer, YOU ARE!                                                         Sister Baek: ME?! You are!

Gemini: Of course... I should have known you were a murderer the moment I saw that poor girl being  choked! Of course... I should have started voting for you the moment I saw you asking so many       questions!                                                                                          Orion: What are you talking about?! Stop acting! I can't believe you tricked me with your act of “oh no, I'm a poor old man in a wheelchair”...                                                         Gemini: Me? I'm not the murderer, YOU ARE!                                                          Orion: WHAT?! You are!

Anna Piaget: What do you mean neither of us is the murderer?                                        Sister Baek: What do you mean neither of us is the murderer?                                        Gemini: What do you mean neither of us is the murderer?                                             Orion: Did you discover anything?                                                                   Annie: Elementary, my dear Orion. You were all gathered here tonight without an apparent reason.    But... what do you all have in common? After Orion's investigation and also a bit of my own, it     became obvious: you're all consummate liars. You all have something to hide. Delilah uses a fake    name and identity. Harley is actually a coward who can't kill anyone. Anna uses polyjuice potion to look like someone else. Sister Baek is not a real medium and her sect is a scam. And Gemini is not  actually blind. The Collector brought you all here to expose yourselves. However, a person who went through so much work doesn't strike me as someone who'd want to miss all the fun of his own game. In fact, I bet he'd want to experience the chaos he masterminded in person! And that's where the two  artifacts we found in the locked room come into play. Two artifacts separated from the rest of the  collection. Why? Because they were recently used. One, a box that can turn you invisible, enabling  you to have a front row seat to enjoy the game you created. And two, a figurine that can create a   duplicate of your body, allowing you to survive in case one of your bodies dies. So, who could have orchestrated all that, you must be wondering? Well, there was someone who didn't fit in with the    rest of the guests. Someone who wasn't mentioned by the briefcase's riddle. Someone who almost      looked like he was meant to die in the first round. Sometimes... the most important clue... is the  one that's missing. Hmm?                                                                            Elliot Cook: Y-You can see me, right?                                                               Orion: Um... yes.                                                                                   Clonk: Congratulations!                                                                             Orion: W-What is going on?                                                                          Elliot Cook: *Standing up* BRILLIANT!  That was brilliant, young girl!                              Annie: T-Thank you, but... um, c-can you get dressed, please?                                       Elliot Cook: Yes, yes, later. How did you make me become visible?                                   Annie: I-I cast a spell of dissipation. I assumed you'd be somewhere nearby.                        Elliot Cook: Ah, clever, very clever!                                                               Orion: What the hell is happening?                                                                  Elliot Cook: This girl solved my riddle game, that's what happened! Everything she said was true! I used the Dopplemorpher to create a copy of myself to be killed in the first round, and then I opened the Inviso-Box to become invisible! *Laughs* It was extremely entertaining to see you all roaming  around the house trying to figure out who was the impostor!                                         Orion: So... there's no murderer, then?                                                             Elliot Cook: Of course not! “Gideon” Cook doesn't exist. I AM The Collector.                        Orion: You son of a bitch... And what would have happened if Annie hadn't appeared and unraveled    your riddle?                                                                                        Elliot Cook: My plan was to proclaim the last two surviving players as the champions. Which you     still are, of course! Hey, and that's not all! You get 50 eternals each as a prize!                 Congratulations!                                                                                    Orion: W-What? 50 eternals?! We almost got brutally killed for 50 miserable eternals?!              Nova: Yeah, Orion's right! The rules said we could take one of the artifacts!                       Elliot Cook: Yeah, well, the rules changed. 50 eternals or go home. This is my game.                Clonk: *Whispering* Actually, if we don't give them the promised prize they could sue us for        violating Eternum's General Code of Ethics, sir.                                                    Elliot Cook: *Whispering* What? They can?                                                           Clonk: *Whispering* Unless they get the stipulated reward, a lawyer could prove that this was       technically physical and psychological torture instead of a voluntary “game”, which is against the  EGCE.                                                                                               Elliot Cook: *Whispering* What would be our chances to win a lawsuit?                               Clonk: *Whispering* Maybe... 50/50.                                                                 Elliot Cook: Mmmm... *Clears throat* Okay, there was a change of plans: you can actually choose     between the artifact and the 50 eternals! What will it be?                                          Artifact                                                                                            Orion: The artifact.                                                                                Elliot Cook: *Grumbling* Okay, okay... Which one do you want? The taxidermied unicorn? Clonk? The   Chalice of Destiny? The bottomless fleshlight?                                                      Annie: THE DOPPLEMORPHER!                                                                           Orion: The thingy that duplicated Nova?                                                             Annie: YES!                                                                                         Orion: Why?                                                                                         Annie: Just imagine... A WHOLE ARMY OF ANNIES! Hundreds of them boarding a spaceship in Andromeda!  Orion: *Snorts* That sounds so cute.                                                                Annie: Not cute, scary!                                                                             Elliot Cook: That's a pretty cool idea, but the Dopplemorpher can only create 2 copies of each      person. You're still in control of both bodies, so it would be impossible to coordinate more than 2 without losing control.                                                                             Annie: Oh. What a downer. Well, you should still get it, Orion.                                     Orion: Do you think so?                                                                             Annie: Yeah! Two Orions sounds pretty powerful! Especially now that you can control your powers.    Orion: Hmmm... maybe you're right.                                                                  Nova: And if tonight is any precedent, if one of your bodies is destroyed you don't die!            Elliot Cook: That's correct. One mind, two bodies.                                                  Orion: Alright, we'll take it.                                                                      Elliot Cook: Done deal. Just keep in mind that you can only use it twice every 25 days.             Orion: Goddammit, this thing is full of limitations...                                              Elliot Cook: It's actually a good item. Just wait for the right time to use it. An important fight, a situation where you need to fake your own death... *Whispering* A tough woman who can handle some double action...                                                                                    Orion: Eh? Oh... (OH...)                                                                            Elliot Cook: *Clears throat* Anyway, go grab the Dopplemorpher and give it to our winners, Clonk.   Clonk: Right away, sir!                                                                             50 eternals                                                                                         Orion: *Sighs* You know what? I've had enough artifacts for today, we'll take the money.            Elliot Cook: Good move.                                                                             Orion: Thank you.                                                                                   Clonk: Congratulations!                                                                             Orion: . . . What...?                                                                               Clonk: You reached the end of the game alive, so you won Mr. Cook's challenge! Congratulations!     Orion: W-What? But... Who's the murderer?!                                                          Clonk: There is no murderer!                                                                        Nova: What?!                                                                                        Clonk: Mr. Cook organized this whole thing to test some of the smartest and strongest Eternum       players in the world! You all concealed yourselves behind some kind of mask. In this place, however, you'd have to prove if your reputation was deserved or it was merely a facade! Only the two best   players would survive the lasers. And the rest would learn a valuable lesson.                       Nova: What?! You're crazy!                                                                          Orion: I need a minute to process all this myself...                                                Annie: So... the Collector is alive?                                                                Clonk: Oh, no, that part was true. He died 2 weeks ago of natural causes. All his artifacts will be donated to the Eternum Mutual Aid Foundation! But no worries, you won't leave this place            empty-handed! Each one of you will receive 50 eternals as a reward for coming out as champions!     Congrats!                                                                                           Orion: 50 eternals?! We almost got brutally killed for 50 miserable eternals?!                      Clonk: 50 eternals and the joy of life!                                                             Orion: The... *Sighs* Okay, I think it's time to go home, girls... I've been in here for way too    long. Well... That was... a pretty traumatic experience. It was nice meeting you though, I guess.   Harley Jones: Thank you.                                                                            Orion: Huh? Why?                                                                                    Harley Jones: Well, if you had voted for me in the last round I'd be dead. So... yeah, I appreciate it.                                                                                                 Orion: Well, I had to vote for someone. And I guess you looked more innocent than the rest for some reason. Probably your panic attacks.                                                                Harley Jones: Yeah... I'm quitting this job. It's not worth it. I don't wanna see blood ever again. Orion: I can respect that.                                                                          Harley Jones: I-I'm gonna open a shop in the Sin City server. Selling outfits and armors. If you    ever go there... pay me a visit. I can give you a discount.                                         Annie: Oh, thank you, Harley! We will!                                                              Orion: Definitely! Thank you! Well... That was... a pretty traumatic experience. It was nice meeting you though, I guess.                                                                               Anna Piaget: That was... certainly frightful. But I guess I have to thank you.                      Orion: Thank me? Why?                                                                               Anna Piaget: Voting for me in the last round would have led to my death. So I am grateful for that. Orion: Oh, well, yeah. I had to vote for someone, and... I trusted you the most, for whatever       reason.                                                                                             Anna Piaget: Maybe because of my huge breasts.                                                      Orion: Um... m-maybe.                                                                               Anna Piaget: Well, as much as I have to admit how this riddle succeeded in highlighting the         complexity and unpredictability of human experience, I can't wait to leave.                         Orion: Yeah, same here.                                                                             Anna Piaget: If you ever get in trouble with the Shogunate in the Meiyo server... give me a call. I know... important people there. And I owe you a favor.                                              Orion: Really? I'll remember that! Thank you, Anna. Well... That was... a pretty traumatic          experience. It was nice meeting you though, I guess.                                                Sister Baek: That's not what I was expecting when I came here, for sure. But thank you.             Orion: Thank you?                                                                                   Sister Baek: If you had voted for me I would be dead. Thank you for that.                           Orion: Well, I had to vote for someone. And I guess you looked more innocent than the rest for some reason. Maybe because you lied since the beginning, so I kind of ruled you out as the murderer,     ironic as it sounds.                                                                                Sister Baek: That's over. From now on, I won't lie ever again, and I'll teach good values to my     followers. I swear.                                                                                 Orion: I'm actually glad to hear that.                                                              Sister Baek: If you ever visit the Andromeda server and need help, you can reach out to me. An      emergency spaceship, weapons, diplomatic access... whatever the Unitologists can offer, it's yours. I owe you a favor.                                                                                  Orion: Wow, that's actually a very generous offer. I'll remember it. Thank you, Sister. Well... That was... a pretty traumatic experience. Sorry about the things I said earlier.                       Gemini: No, I'm the one who's sorry, young man. And thank you.                                      Orion: Thank you? Why?                                                                              Gemini: If you had voted for me in the last round I'd be a dead man now. I appreciate it.           Orion: Well, I had to vote for someone. And I guess you looked more innocent than the rest for some reason. Even if you lied about being blind. ...Probably because of being old and handicapped.       Gemini: I've had enough action for a lifetime. I'll stick to known servers from now on.             Orion: That's probably the smartest move.                                                           Gemini: Look, I know you might not believe me, but... My clairvoyance is real. I can see things. If you ever think that my visions can help you somehow, come find me in the Agora server. Sometimes    being lost is just an opportunity for discovery. And all you need is a hand pointing you the right  way.                                                                                                Orion: Hmm. Thank you, Mr. Gemini. I'll remember it.                                                Elliot Cook: Okay, here's your artifact. Now take it and get the fuck off of my property.           Orion: Gladly!                                                                                      Elliot Cook: Clonk was programmed to kick everyone out once the game finished, so I wouldn't stay   for too long if I were you.                                                                         Clonk: That's correct! We ran out of time, ladies and gentlemen! Anyway, ladies and gentlemen, we   ran out of time! Thank you all for visiting and paying your respects to the memory of Mr. Cook! I'm sure he will be smiling down from heaven!                                                           Elliot Cook: Um... yeah, you don't really have to say that anymore, Clonk.                          Clonk: You now have 45 seconds to vacate the premises before the defense lasers obliterate all      non-resident life forms inside the house!                                                           Orion: W-What?                                                                                      Clonk: 40 seconds!                                                                                  Orion: O-OKAY, WE'RE LEAVING!                                                                       Clonk: Good luck!                                                                                   Harley Jones: WHAT?!                                                                                Orion: You have to be kidding me...                                                                 Nova: Oh god...                                                                                     Orion: (Fuck... Come on, Orion, think... You're running out of time... This is the last round and   one of them is lying about knowing the Collector... but WHO?!)                                      The girls jump over the counter and start searching among the shelves.                              Orion: Anyone remember the room number?                                                             Annie: I think it was... number 6?                                                                  Nova: Number 6... Bingo!                                                                            Orion: Nice job! Now let's see what's hidden there...                                               Anna Piaget: *Anxiously biting her lip* The last round... You have to discover who it is, Anna...   You're cleverer than them... T-They want to kill you because of your beauty! They're jealous!       Orion: I see you had another dose of polyjuice potion. Um... are you okay?                          Anna Piaget: But they won't get me... I'll outsmart everyone...                                     Orion: Alright, I'll let you be... Hello again.                                                     Anna Piaget: Please, stay away. Any words or actions on your part would not be beneficial to either of us.                                                                                              Orion: *Opening Annie's bottle* I just had one last question to ask you. I was wondering if...      H-Holy fuck, this smells terrible.                                                                  Anna Piaget: What's in that bottle?                                                                 Orion: I'm honestly not sure. I was... Wow... That's certainly a downgrade.                         Anna Piaget: What?                                                                                  Orion: You know, I'm no psychologist, but let me tell you that it's important to cultivate          self-acceptance, with both strengths and weaknesses.                                                Anna Piaget: Excuse me? Huh...? HUH...?! WHAT THE HELL?! WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?!                    Orion: So polyjuice potion, eh? The real person you took this appearance from wouldn't be very happy to discover this.                                                                                  Anna Piaget: Where's the bathroom?! I need to fix this!                                             Orion: Down the hall to the right.                                                                  Ms. Piaget runs out of the hall trying to cover her face with her hands.                            Orion: (Another liar caught red-handed... I could get the hang of this.) Well...                    Anna Piaget: So you didn't keep your promise.                                                       Orion: I thought that...                                                                            Anna Piaget: There are no further matters to discuss between us.                                    Orion: Your theory was fucking wrong.                                                               Anna Piaget: I... need to think. The complexity of this case has exceeded initial expectations.     Orion: Hello again.                                                                                 Anna Piaget: Don't bother me. I need to think. The complexity of this case has exceeded initial     expectations.                                                                                       Orion: But...                                                                                       Anna Piaget: Please, stay away. Any words or actions on your part would not be beneficial to either of us.                                                                                              Orion: . . . Hello, Ms. Piaget. Hello again, Ms. Piaget.                                            Anna Piaget: Hello... how can I help you?                                                           Orion: Tell me, what's your opinion on this matter?                                                 Anna Piaget: I'll admit that it was intriguing to see that Elliot was actually not the murderer, but given the current circumstances, I think there's only one possible suspect left. As a seasoned     professional with 15 years of experience in this field, I have developed a keen ability to discern  when an individual is being deceitful. And Sister Baek is obviously hiding something. She's the     murderer.                                                                                           Orion: And what about these laser beams that kill eliminated players? You seem surprisingly calm    about all of that.                                                                                  Anna Piaget: If I was unable to regulate my own emotional responses, I couldn't claim the title of  the world’s foremost psychoanalyst.                                                                 Orion: That makes sense... Well, thank you for sharing your opinion with me. I'll go talk to the    others.                                                                                             Anna Piaget: Hopefully this one will be the last round.                                             Orion: Hello, Ms. Piaget.                                                                           Anna Piaget: Delilah Warren and her two friends... Enigmatic pieces in this puzzle. How can I help  you?                                                                                                Orion: I was wondering if you had a prime suspect for Mr. Cook's murder.                            Anna Piaget: The notion of Elliot's culpability in his father's murder appears to me to be          self-evident.                                                                                       Orion: Really? Are you sure?                                                                        Anna Piaget: Admittedly, without direct observation of the crime, I cannot assert with absolute     certainty that Elliot is the perpetrator. However, his observable physical reactions exhibited      distinct indications of a guilty conscience.                                                        Orion: To be fair, we just met him for a couple of minutes.                                         Anna Piaget: That's more than enough. I can elaborate a psychological profile of anyone in less than that.                                                                                              Orion: Really? I'm not so sure...                                                                   Anna Piaget: Do you want a quick demonstration?                                                     Yes                                                                                                 Orion: Eh... sure, enlighten me.                                                                    Anna Piaget: You've been fruitlessly struggling to avoid gazing at my well-developed breasts since  we started speaking.                                                                                Orion: I-I'm sorry?                                                                                 Anna Piaget: I don't blame you. Your behavior is indicative of a passionate personality. You're     intense and enthusiastic, and probably easily aroused. However, you have some self-control. You're  polite, ambitious, and intelligent. But you're also impulsive, and your disregard for consequences  can sometimes lead you into trouble.                                                                Orion: Erm...                                                                                       Anna Piaget: Delilah seems to be strong, although she suffers from a massive lack of                self-confidence. She masks it behind an overly energetic attitude, but she clearly suffers in social settings and has trouble interacting with new people. Even if she's probably used to being alone,  she constantly needs to seek validation from others or to strive towards self-imposed objectives in order to establish her worth. And this girl seems more sociable, although she struggles with chronic anxiety. Classic Type D personality: shy, caring, sincere, and extremely dependable. She usually   overthinks everything she says or does, panics easily, and prefers to steer clear of confrontational situations whenever possible. Close?                                                               Orion: Um... m-maybe some of it. *Clears throat* But anyway, we've gotta go now to... erm... I want to talk to everyone before making our decision.                                                     No                                                                                                  Orion: Eh... I'd rather not, honestly. I'm not in the mood to be psychoanalyzed right now.          Anna Piaget: Very well. I'll see you at the vote.                                                   Orion: Of course. Thank you for your time, Ms. Piaget. Hello again, Ms. Piaget.                     Anna Piaget: Yes? Do you need anything else? I don't plan on showing you my breasts again. Do you   need anything else or have you just come back to stare at my chest again?                           Orion: N-No, nothing else.                                                                          Anna Piaget: Where did your friends go?                                                             Orion: Oh... um... it's complicated. They're trying to sort out some problems of theirs.            Anna Piaget: And I see you took the chance to stare even more effusively at my cleavage.            Orion: Come on now, no I didn't!                                                                    Anna Piaget: It's quite apparent that you are deeply interested in my attributes. I can show them to you, if you want.                                                                                  Orion: What...?                                                                                     Anna Piaget: Let's do something, I'll let you see my bare chest if you promise to vote for Sister   Baek. She's the murderer, I assure you. I just want to conclude this game as soon as possible.      Orion: Um...                                                                                        Okay                                                                                                Orion: Okay, deal. (I see no reason to say no.)                                                     Anna Piaget: Very well.                                                                             Orion: (Damn, is she really gonna do it?) Damn... They're... quite impressive, I've gotta say.      Anna Piaget: Thank you.                                                                             Orion: They're... certainly huge. And they hold up really well for your age. I mean... not that I   think you're old or anything.                                                                       Anna Piaget: Don't worry... I'll take it as a compliment. I hope I managed to satiate your          curiosity.                                                                                          Orion: Very much, yes...                                                                            Anna Piaget: And I trust that you will keep your promise during the vote.                           Pass                                                                                                Orion: I'm gonna pass.                                                                              Anna Piaget: Your self-control is admirable. Very well. Regardless, I trust that you will arrive at the appropriate verdict during the vote.                                                            Orion: Of course. Thank you for your time, Ms. Piaget.                                              Annie: Wow...                                                                                       Nova: Damn, is that an artifact too?                                                                Annie: I-It looks scary... It has fangs on its fangs.                                               Sister Baek: A demogorgon, taxidermied and brought here from the depths of the Andromeda server.    Orion: I wouldn't want to encounter one of those.                                                   Sister Baek: Luckily, you won't. They went extinct a year ago. A more advanced race hunted them     down, as they did with many other species in the galaxy after the plague started.                   Orion: (A new species...? Could it be the aliens I found on Astrocorp's space station when I was    there with Annie?) Is this part of an event organized by Ulysses?                                   Sister Baek: It is not. They're the beginning of the Convergence.                                   Orion: The Convergence?                                                                             Sister Baek: They were sent by the creators to purge humanity's corruption from Eternum. And soon,  they will expand to other servers. We must yield our bodies to them so we can be reunited and reborn after death as artificial intelligences.                                                           Orion: Ehh... sure. So... you said you can talk to the dead?                                        Sister Baek: I can. Do you want to receive or send any special message to your loved ones?          Orion: A... message? Just like that?                                                                Sister Baek: The powers granted through my beliefs are immeasurable.                                Orion: Hmm... How about... my friend... Chang? He died 8 years ago in a tragic accident. He was     trying to save a little girl from a burning building in China when he was hit by some falling       debris.                                                                                             Sister Baek: Ah... yes... I can see him...                                                          Orion: . . .                                                                                        Sister Baek: I'm getting a strong message from the spirit world... He's at peace... He wants me to  tell you that he knows you're going through a difficult time right now, but everything will be      okay... He says... “I love you, broseph”...                                                         Orion: . . .                                                                                        Sister Baek: That's all I could sense.                                                              Play along                                                                                          Orion: (It might be better to play along for now.) Um... cool. Tell him I love him too.             Sister Baek: I will... the next time a window to the unknown realm is opened.                       Orion: Cool.                                                                                        Call her bullshit                                                                                   Orion: Okay, that was such bullshit. First off, my friend Chang isn't even dead.                    Sister Baek: Then he must be in a deep slumber of some sort. Sometimes there are interferences in   the signals of the cosmos.                                                                          Orion: How the... Okay, whatever... (She's full of shit, just like Gemini. I can't trust any of     these people. But she could be a trickster like any other, or... she could be hiding something else. She's obviously full of shit, but I gotta figure out why. Is she just a trickster like any other?  Or is she hiding something else... I better be careful.) We've gotta go. See you around, sister. (No more “calls” to the afterlife for now...)                                                          Gemini: Someone killed the Collector... But who... The truth is here somewhere... there has to be   something I'm missing...                                                                            Orion: So...                                                                                        Gemini: Don't talk to me. You're my prime suspect.                                                  Orion: Bold thing to say for someone who lied about being blind since the beginning. I could say the same thing.                                                                                        Gemini: Hmm.                                                                                        Orion: Sir.                                                                                         Gemini: I don't want any more candy, thank you.                                                     Orion: (“Gemini's eyes see more than he dares to declare”...) . . . Hello, sir.                     Gemini: Ah, hello, Mr. Orion. How can I help you?                                                   Orion: I found these candies on the hall desk, and thought you'd like to eat one. They're delicious.Gemini: How sweet of you, thank you. I'll eat one, I appreciate it.                                 Orion: No problem.                                                                                  You place the candy inside your boxers and actively rub it against your balls for a few seconds.    Orion: *Handing him the candy* There you go.                                                        Gemini: . . .                                                                                       Orion: . . . Open your hand, I'll give it to you.                                                   Gemini: . . . Thank you, but I'm not in the mood for candy right now.                               Orion: You wanted it just a moment ago.                                                             Gemini: I remembered sugar does me no good.                                                         Orion: Ah...                                                                                        Gemini: . . .                                                                                       Orion: . . .                                                                                        Gemini: AAAAH!                                                                                      You fake a kick but stop right before hitting Gemini.                                               Orion: You have good reflexes for a blind man.                                                      Gemini: . . . OKAY, OKAY, yes, I'm not actually blind! Fucking kids...                              Orion: I knew it!                                                                                   Gemini: But I didn't kill The Collector! I didn't even know him!                                    Orion: Then why did you lie?                                                                        Gemini: Because it sells more! My powers are real! I can really see the future! But no one gave a   fuck about me until I became “The Blind Oracle”...                                                  Orion: So... it's all a marketing decision?                                                         Gemini: You could say that.                                                                         Orion: I don't know...                                                                              Gemini: Look, if you really want to win this game, you can't vote for me. I swear to god, I am not  the murderer!                                                                                       Orion: I'll have to think about it.                                                                 Gemini: *Sighs* I hope you make the right decision...                                               Orion: Well... you seemed very convinced about Sister Baek's culpability. So... any ideas, sir?     Gemini: I need... to think.                                                                         Orion: Hmm. (71 years old...) Good evening, sir.                                                    Gemini: Ah, that voice... Mr. Orion. I'm surprised you didn't come before. Hello again, young man.  Do you need anything?                                                                               Orion: I was just wondering if you have any lead on who the murderer is.                            Gemini: Well... after what happened to Elliot, I started paying more attention to what everyone was saying... and there seems to be someone who doesn't fit in. Sister Baek.                            Orion: Sister Baek? Do you think she's the murderer?                                                Gemini: I'm not sure, but... there's something about her that doesn't add up.                       Orion: Hmm... I see. I'll keep it in mind, thank you.                                               Gemini: Hello again, young man. Is there anything else I can do for you?                            Orion: Not right now, sir. But if you allow me the compliment... I'm actually kind of impressed by  how thoughtful and eloquent you seem to be, despite your age. My grandpa is 75 years old and...     well, he doesn't seem even half as quick-witted as you. He's been struggling quite a bit lately. I  mean, I don't know how old you are, but...                                                          Gemini: *Chuckles* Thank you, kid. I am 71 years old, and the years sure do start to weigh quite    heavily. But even though my body gets weaker, I can proudly say that my intellect remains as sharp  as when I was young.                                                                                Orion: (71 years old, eh...) That's impressive. But anyway, I'll stop bothering you now. Thank you  so much for your time, sir.                                                                         Gemini: I'll see you at the voting, then. Stay safe.                                                Annie: W-Why does he look so scary?                                                                 Nova: Reminds me of the wheelchair guy from the game Outlast. Have you played it?                   Annie: A horror game? N-No, thanks.                                                                 Nova: Lucky you! There's a new Eternum server that's creating remakes of vintage horror–            Annie: I-I SAID NO THANKS!                                                                          Orion: Good evening, Mr. Gemini.                                                                    Gemini: Ah, that voice... Mr. Orion. How can I help you?                                            Orion: We were just trying to speak with everyone before the round concludes. Do you also think     Elliot Cook is the murderer of his father?                                                          Gemini: Well, he's the only one that seems to have a motive for the killing. None of the other      contestants knew The Collector before coming here... or so they say.                                Orion: Hmm... that's a fair point. Can you see a vision of the future to know if we'll be able to   solve the game?                                                                                     Gemini: *Chuckles* Unfortunately no, I can't. That's not how it works. I can't choose the subject or purpose of my visions.                                                                             Orion: And can you see anything else about me right now?                                            Gemini: Hmm... I'm afraid I see... nothing. I'm sorry.                                              Orion: (Well, that's two empty futures in a row for me, if you count Luna's visions. I wonder if    that's good or bad.)                                                                                Gemini: Your destiny seems to be written in a blank book. BUT YOU...                                Annie: I-Is he talking to me?                                                                       Gemini: Yes... I can see something in your future...                                                Annie: How does he know where I am?                                                                 Gemini: I see something...                                                                          Annie: Please be something good...                                                                  Gemini: I see... a kitten...                                                                        Annie: Oh!                                                                                          Gemini: And I see suffocation...                                                                    Annie: Oh...                                                                                        Gemini: Asphyxia... choking...? Death! Do you have a pool? You could drown!                         Annie: I don't.                                                                                     Gemini: Do you usually choke on food?                                                               Annie: Not really.                                                                                  Gemini: If I were you I'd avoid eating solid food just in case...                                   Annie: Until when?                                                                                  Gemini: My visions don't have a set timing, I'm afraid. It could be one hour, or it could be a      month...                                                                                            Annie: I can't eat anything solid for a month?!                                                     Gemini: And I see... loneliness...                                                                  Annie: Oh...                                                                                        Gemini: Jealousy... and... tears...                                                                 Annie: Whaaat...? When?! For how long?                                                              Gemini: My visions don't have a set timing, I'm afraid. It could be one hour, it could be a month... Or it could be your whole life...                                                                  Orion: Okay, okay, thank you for your visions, Gemini... Very reassuring. (He sounds like another   bullshitter, just like Sister Baek. I can't trust any of these people.)                             Gemini: I wish I could only see good things. But the future is a fickle mistress.                   Orion: Yeah... Well, we have to go talk to the other guests. It was a pleasure meeting you.         Gemini: Of course, that is smart. Good luck, my young friends.                                      Orion: (I should continue exploring.)                                                               Harley Jones: *Hyperventilating* They're all out to get me. They're always watching. Always         listening. They want me to be the next one to die. I won't let them. They're trying to drive me     insane. But I'll kill them first. Yes! I'll kill them. Everyone kills. It can't be that hard.       Orion: Um... Harley? Are you okay?                                                                  Harley Jones: That ginger girl is the ringleader. She's allied with the robot. I can feel its       presence. He wants me dead. But I won't let him win. I won't let them break me. I have to get out of here before it's too late. I'll kill myself. I won't let them win.                                 Orion: Okay...                                                                                      Harley Jones: *Leaping to her feet* YOU AGAIN?! STAY AWAY FROM ME!                                  Orion: I-I just have one question!                                                                  Harley Jones: You already asked me a question before!                                               Orion: Yes, but now–                                                                                Nova: Well, well, well... Look who's here. The Black Widow, the Angel of Death, the Femme Fatale!   Harley Jones herself!                                                                               Orion: Delilah?                                                                                     Nova: H-Hi Orion.                                                                                   Nova: We were about to fix this duplication problem of ours, but first I felt the need to pay a     visit to this killing machine here.                                                                 Harley Jones: W-What the fuck is this shit?! Why are there two of you now?                          Nova: That is irrelevant.                                                                           Nova: I m-mean, she does have a point... quite an odd sight in my opinion.                          Nova: What's really surprising here...                                                              Nova: Eh, j-just a small thing of note...                                                           Nova: ...is  how much you seem to be panicking tonight.                                             Harley Jones: W-What?!                                                                              Nova: I mean... she is right... sort of... y-you do have a bit of sweat on your forehead...         Nova: I thought you'd be used to seeing death all around you by now. Best hitwoman in all of        Eternum, right?                                                                                     Nova: I-It is what you introduced yourself as...                                                    Harley Jones: T-This is completely different!                                                       Nova: Really? Because what I think is that you're a FAKER.                                          Nova: W-Well, we're not really sure... it's just an assumption.                                     Harley Jones: What the fuck do you mean by that?! I could kill you in a heartbeat if I wanted to!   Nova: Could you? Because I doubt it. I know you're a fraud, Harley.                                 Nova: We're not entirely convinced. It's just a hunch.                                              Nova: I know you don't have the guts to kill anyone. You are a COWARD.                              Nova: W-We are just spitballing here.                                                               Harley Jones: Shut up if you don't want me to kill you!                                             Nova: *Handing Dione to Harley* In that case, I'll make it easy for you.                            Harley Jones: W-What are you doing?                                                                 Nova: COME ON, YOU BIG BAAAAD ASSASSIN!!! SHOOT ME IN THE FUCKING FACE! SHOULD FEEL LIKE JUST       ANOTHER DAY ON THE JOB!                                                                             Harley Jones: W-What the fuck is wrong with you?!                                                   Nova: Aren't you a killer?! KILL! If you kill me you'll be one step closer to winning this game!    Nova: T-This is a bad idea!                                                                         Harley Jones: You're crazy!                                                                         Nova: Shoot me if you have the guts! How about I kill you if you don't pull the trigger?!           Harley Jones: *Hyperventilating* W-What?!                                                           Nova: I swear to god I'LL KILL YOU! UNLESS YOU PULL THE FUCKING TRIGGER! PULL THE TRIGGER!!!        Harley Jones: *Hyperventilating* Aah... ahh... ahhh... *Pushing Nova away* I CAN'T! OKAY?! I CAN'T  KILL! BLOOD TERRIFIES ME!                                                                           Orion: What...? Aren't you a hitwoman?                                                              Harley Jones: IT'S ALL A SHAM! People hire me just for my image, but I haven't actually killed      anyone... EVER! HAPPY?!                                                                             Nova: My intuition never fails. Did you see that, Orion? D-Did you see it?! We busted her!          Orion: I did! That was amazing! You've got some serious detective skills.                           Nova: Would you say we deserve a headpat for that level of amazingness?                             Nova: Oh, please, c-can you stop embarrassing us already?! D-Don't listen to her, Orion. L-Let's not make a scene, I b-beg you.                                                                         Pat her head                                                                                        Orion: *Patting Nova's head* You did really good there, Delilah! *Patting Nova's head* I'm seriously impressed!                                                                                         Nova: Mmmmm...                                                                                      Nova: Mmmmm... Alright, Delilah 2, you did good! I'm proud of you.                                  Don't pat her head                                                                                  Orion: *Chuckles* I'm still not sure which one of you is the more real one, so... I'll listen to    her. You did really good there, though, that is true.                                               Nova: Okay, okay, I guess you can take this round, Delilah 2.                                       Nova: W-Why am I Delilah 2?                                                                         Nova: It was fun, but I guess it's time to go back to normal now... Farewell, friends! And see you  later, Orion!                                                                                       Nova: O-Okay, w-we did what you wanted, we should go back to normal now...                          Nova: Of course, of course... you're welcome for the help, Orion! I'll see your sexy ass at the main hall!                                                                                              Harley Jones: NOW GET AWAY FROM ME, YOU FREAKS!                                                     Orion: O-Okay, okay, we're leaving! (Damn, that was unexpected. Although... that means she can't be the murderer. Unless... she's putting on one hell of a performance. Could it be...? I better stay   away from her for now... I don’t want her to have an anxiety attack or something. If Harley is older than Nova, it means that I need to use Delilah's age...)                                           Harley Jones: *Leaping to her feet* YOU AGAIN?! STAY AWAY FROM ME!                                  Orion: I-I just have one question!                                                                  Harley Jones: What kind of question?                                                                Orion: (What is she doing on the floor?) Harley...?                                                 Harley Jones: *Leaping to her feet* WHAT DO YOU WANT?! STAY AWAY FROM ME!                           Orion: C-Calm down! What's wrong with you?                                                          Harley Jones: *Hyperventilating* They brought me here to kill me! I won't let you... no... NO, I    WON'T!                                                                                              Orion: I'm not the murderer! I'm trying to discover who's the real killer to get out of here alive, just like you!                                                                                      Harley Jones: I can't trust you... I can't trust anyone. And Prophet Wheelie Wonka LEAST OF ALL!    Orion: Gemini...?                                                                                   Harley Jones: Yes... that old bastard thinks he can trick me just because he's a poor blind man who can't walk... BULLSHIT! He's the murderer! It's as clear as day!                                    Orion: Alright... (She's completely paranoid. I won't get much else out of her.) Hey, before I go... can I ask you a question?                                                                          Harley Jones: What kind of question? N-Now get away from me!                                        Orion: How old are you?                                                                             Harley Jones: What? Why?                                                                            Orion: Um... Clonk told me that the murderer is... older than a certain age. I'm trying to see if I can rule you out or not.                                                                            Harley Jones: Really...? And what's that certain age?                                               Orion: Tell me how old are you and I'll share it with you.                                          Harley Jones: Hmm... I'm 25.                                                                        Orion: Oh! Good! He said the murderer is older than... 30 years old, so you and Delilah are both off the hook. (Thank god she bought that.)                                                             Harley Jones: Of course we are... It's that fucking Gemini guy who killed The Collector, don't you  see?! Must be the nun who killed him... or that bimbo bitch! It was her!                            Orion: O-Okay, I'll go tell the others! Be careful! (I better stay away for now...) Hello again,    Harley.                                                                                             Harley Jones: Look who's here! The Lalala trio.                                                     Orion: Tell me, do you have any suspects?                                                           Harley Jones: Suspects? Please, this case is closed already. It's super obvious that Elliot killed  his father. Eternum's property can be inherited the same way as goods in the real world, and he's a greedy bastard. Probably just a dumbass who planned everything out like shit.                       Orion: (Hmm, everyone seems convinced that Elliot is the murderer. Maybe they're right. Perhaps I'm just overthinking it all and there's no twist. Or perhaps one of them is trying to deceive me...)   So... a hitwoman, eh? What do you do exactly?                                                       Harley Jones: Agh, let's not talk about work, please... I kill people, I get paid, etcetera,        etcetera, repeat, clink, cha-ching. You know, now that I’ve gotten a good look at you, you look very cute. I can see how you got two girlfriends. I'd even ask to join your little harem if I wasn't a  member of the Sapphic sisterhood.                                                                   Orion: Um... thank you. They're not my girlfriends, though. We're just... friends. (It's            complicated.)                                                                                       Harley Jones: No way, really? Are you seriously telling me you have those two fun-sized cuties      around you and you're not doing anything with them? Come on, look at them! They're adorable! How    tall are you, babe?                                                                                 Annie: Me? Um... like, 5'1'' I think.                                                               Harley Jones: And you, sussy girl?                                                                  Nova: Erm... I'm honestly not sure. Maybe... 5'2'' or 5'3'' I guess.                                Harley Jones: AH! Adorable. I knew you were petite girls, even if the heels somewhat disguise it a  bit. Don't you agree with me, Orion? Do you like short girls?                                       I love them                                                                                         Orion: For sure, nothing better than a short girl. They're cute, everything they do looks adorable, and they're much easier to cuddle with or lift up.                                                  Harley Jones: And the sex is amazing. They’re almost like pizza dough! Soft and flexible, fun to    squeeze. You can grab them, spin them, and toss them up. If you can imagine it, they can do it. Ah, now I’m hungry all of a sudden...                                                                   Orion: Uh... yes, that's also true, I guess... I suppose it offers many more... possibilities.      Annie: . . .                                                                                        Nova: . . .                                                                                         Annie: . . .                                                                                        Nova: . . .                                                                                         Orion: Well, we've gotta go.                                                                        I prefer tall girls                                                                                 Orion: I prefer them taller, to be honest.                                                          Harley Jones: Agh, I handed it to you on a silver platter. You’ve got no rizz, Orion.               Orion: Erm... a-anyway, we've gotta go. (Well, in Nova's case I definitely wouldn't say that...     Well, in Annie's case I definitely wouldn't say that...) I'm not. (I wish...) *Clears throat* But   anyway, we've gotta go. I want to talk to the other guests before the time runs out.                Harley Jones: Sure... have fun, guys.                                                               Orion: (I should explore the rest of the house.) Hello there.                                       Elliot Cook: The fuck do you want now?                                                              Orion: Um... I just wanted to say hello.                                                            Elliot Cook: Listen. I didn't kill my fucking father. I’m no saint, but I’m not a damn murderer,    alright?                                                                                            Orion: I know! Well, I don't know, but I kind of believe you. If you had really killed him, you'd   have come here with a much better alibi prepared.                                                   Elliot Cook: Are you calling me stupid?                                                             Orion: No, I'm just saying that if we cooperate we might–                                           Elliot Cook: I'm not gonna play this stupid game. No, I didn't kill my father, but he was an idiot  who abandoned his family years ago. I owe him nothing, and I have no plans to honor his memory by   participating in this shit.                                                                         Orion: But–                                                                                         Elliot Cook: I said I don’t give a fuck, now can you stop bothering me and let me smoke my cigar in peace?                                                                                              Annie: *Sticking her tongue out* EEEEH, fine, help yourself then! We were just trying to lend a     hand... no need to be so grumpy.                                                                    Elliot Cook: Whatever you say. Now fuck off.                                                        Orion: (What a fucking asshole...)                                                                  Elliot Cook: Still here? I said fuck off.                                                           Sister Baek: O Sacred Makers of Eternum, you that are the source of our unity, the means by which we will be reborn... Guide me in my actions to show me the way to the true ascension in this digital  realm...                                                                                            Orion: Praying...?                                                                                  Sister Baek: Protect me from the fragmentation and isolation that plague us in the analog world...  In your name, we pledge our loyalty and devotion, now and forevermore.                              Orion: (I wonder if she really believes all this bullshit, or if it's just a means to keep scamming people on that Sapphire planet... I didn't think it was possible, but she went even crazier...)     Sister Baek: Sapphire? The planet in Andromeda? No, I've never been there...                        Orion: Hi there.                                                                                    Sister Baek: What do you want?                                                                      Orion: Turns out I found a clue that indicates that some guests are hiding something.               Sister Baek: Mm-hm. And you don't believe I have medium powers. I don't give a shit. Just let me be.Orion: Actually... I wanted to ask you about what you do in... Sapphire.                            Sister Baek: . . . Wha... W-W-WHAT?! W-What Sapphire?!                                              Orion: You know what Sapphire. (Damn, she panicked just by mentioning it. I'll have to improvise a  bit here...)                                                                                        Sister Baek: How do you know about Sapphire?! They join and pay voluntarily! No one is being forced into anything! EVERYTHING IS LEGAL!                                                                 Orion: Then you won't mind if I explain what you do to the Praetorians.                             Sister Baek: No!!! I need the money! To... help the people! Please don't say anything!              Orion: I don't know...                                                                              Sister Baek: I'll pay you! I have 100 eternals right here! They're yours!                           Deal                                                                                                Orion: I'd make that deal.                                                                          Sister Baek: O-Of course! Take them! Just promise me you won't say anything!                        Orion: Not if you don't give me reasons to.                                                         I want more                                                                                         Orion: I know you have more.                                                                        Sister Baek: I... O-Okay, 120 eternals! That’s all I have! The rest is frozen in the Garrington     bank, I swear! Just promise me you won't say anything!                                              Orion: Not if you don't give me reasons to.                                                         I don't want your money                                                                             Orion: I don't want your dirty money. I won't say anything if you don't give me reasons to.         Sister Baek: I won't! But don't mention Sapphire to anyone!                                         Orion: Alright... You better not be the murderer or I'll spill the beans about Sapphire. (I wonder  what she's doing there... Nothing legal, that's for sure.)                                          Sister Baek: Stay away from me. I can't trust anyone.                                               Orion: Taking a stroll?                                                                             Sister Baek: I needed some fresh air after what happened. And it feels good to finally get away from that psychologist's pungent perfume.                                                               Orion: So... any leads about who the murderer is?                                                   Sister Baek: I'll admit that I voted for Elliot, but... I had my suspicions about someone else since the beginning. Blind, paralytic, old, and super polite. Come on... they must think we're stupid.   Orion: Are you suspicious of Gemini?                                                                Sister Baek: I mean, how the hell can he even move around the house if he's blind? Am I supposed to believe he's like a bat and has echolocation too? Trust me, if you wanna win this game, vote for    him.                                                                                                Orion: I'll... keep it in mind. I need to go back inside.                                           Sister Baek: Sure... see you later.                                                                 Orion: (She seems to have made a decision already. Fuck, I wasted too much time... I need to go to  vote or I'll be eliminated for not showing up. I'll come back here later... in case the game doesn't end after this next vote.)                                                                         Clonk: Ah, hello, Mr. Orion! It is time to vote!                                                    Orion: Okay... let's do this.                                                                       Nova: *Trying to force the door* Hmmm... dammit, this door is locked. Why? The rest of the doors    seem to be open.                                                                                    Orion: (Good gracious... I didn't realize how good Nova's butt looks in those pants until now. The  latex sticks to her like a second skin. I need to write a thank you letter to that fashion designer. Now I'm getting flashbacks of that night at the college party... Now I'm getting flashbacks of that night on the Egyptian server again... That was crazy...)                                           Nova: *Turning around* Impossible. It won't open without a key.                                     Try again                                                                                           Orion: You sure? I think it's worth trying it again.                                                Nova: *Grunting* GGGgghh... AGH! Impossible. Nope, it won't move an inch. This is a good lock.      Orion: Too bad...                                                                                   Nova: I guess they locked it for a reason.                                                          Look elsewhere                                                                                      Orion: Well, I guess they locked it for a reason. And that's exactly why we have to get it open.    Let's keep looking, maybe we’ll find a way to get in somewhere. That door won't open without the    key... Yes!                                                                                         Nova: Making strides!                                                                               Orion: Okay, we don't have much time, so let's see what we can find.                                Annie: I'll go check out the room at the end!                                                       Nova: I'll take the entrance!                                                                       Orion: Alright, I'll see what I can find here, then... A briefcase... Looks like it's got a         combination lock of 4 numbers. *Sitting down* (And what's on this sticky note? A picturesque group  of 6 gathered tonight, Each one's age is hidden from my sight. The oldest and the youngest I seek,  Multiply their years, don't be meek. Now riddles? This man is playing with us even after death. He  wanted someone to enter this room... and definitely wanted us to open this briefcase. Looks like    it's telling me that the combination of the briefcase is the resulting number of multiplying the    ages of the oldest and the youngest ones of the group. Which have to be Gemini and... Nova? Or      perhaps Harley Jones? I'll have to ask them.) Alright girls! This is promising! The name of the     person who killed Mr. Gideon could be inside this briefcase! This has to be the key to win the game! We're almost there! We just need to know the ages of Gemini and Harley Jones.                      Nova: What for?                                                                                     Orion: There's some kind of riddle that says in order to open the case, I have to multiply the ages of the youngest and oldest of the group.                                                            Nova: Am I younger than Harley Jones?                                                               Orion: That's what we'll have to find out.                                                          Nova: Oh... alright!                                                                                Orion: What do you have there, by the way?                                                          Nova: Oh, just something I found on that cabinet over there.                                        Orion: I wouldn't touch anything, just in case. We don't know what these artifacts could– What...   Nova: Huh? Is anything wrong?                                                                       Orion: For a moment I thought I saw... What the heck...                                             Nova: Hmm?                                                                                          Nova: Huh?                                                                                          Nova: Huh?                                                                                          Nova: Hmm?                                                                                          Nova: WOOOOW!                                                                                       Nova: AAAAAAARGH!!!! Oh my god, there's another Nova!                                               Nova: No way! Did the artifact do this?                                                             Nova: T-This is horrible!                                                                           Nova: This is sooo cool!                                                                            Nova: A nightmare!                                                                                  Nova: A fantasy!                                                                                    Orion: Holy shit, this is... certainly incredible. Who's the real Nova?                             Nova: I am!                                                                                         Nova: M-Me!                                                                                         Nova: I mean... she's Nova too.                                                                     Nova: W-Well, we both are... somehow.                                                               Nova: But I'm more authentic.                                                                       Nova: B-But I'm real...er!                                                                          Orion: So... there are two Novas now?                                                               Nova: It's not like... I mean... we're the same person, but... disconnected in a way.               Orion: Same person...? Do you know what the other is thinking?                                      Nova: Yes! Well, I mean... n-not exactly. That body and this one may be separated, but I'm the same person! We have one mind!                                                                           Orion: Okay...                                                                                      Nova: I know it sounds weird, but... I can feel everything that the other body is feeling. I'm      standing right there, b-but at the same time... I'm also here. I-I don't know how to explain it!    Nova: One person, two bodies! It's not so hard!                                                     Nova: When we talk it's like... speaking to yourself. I know what she's thinking and saying,        because... I'm also the one saying it.                                                              Nova: All I know is that I've never felt better! I feel confident and revitalized!                  Nova: This is not good... we have to revert it...                                                   Nova: Later! First we have to solve this mystery murder!                                            Nova: But we have to find a way to go back to normal...                                             Nova: Okay, okay, let's just go see the other guests first! I want to rub Gemini's bald head! Oh,   and let's shoot something in the garden! *Giggles* I saw some big-ass guns we could use... Let's    go!                                                                                                 Nova: W-What did you say?! Please, don't! Oh my god, this is so embarrassing, please come back!     Both Novas rush out of the room.                                                                    Orion: (Shit, this is getting out of hand... But I can't go after them, I have to stick to the quest of discovering who this murderer is, otherwise we’re gonna lose the game and all get killed...)    Um... Annie? We have a problem.                                                                     Annie: Wow, come here, Orion!                                                                       Orion: We have two problems, actually. Both ginger.                                                 Annie: Look at this box!                                                                            Orion: What box?                                                                                    Annie: Exactly! It's invisible! But I can feel it. It's right here in my hands! *Opening the box* I wonder what's inside...                                                                             Orion: . . .                                                                                        Annie: AAAARGH, I'M INVISIBLE!                                                                      Orion: CAN YOU TWO STOP TOUCHING THINGS?!                                                           Annie: What am I gonna do now?!                                                                     Orion: I-I don't know, maybe close the box again?                                                   Annie: Erm... I accidentally threw it out the window when I got startled...                         Orion: You have to be kidding me...                                                                 Annie: Oh shit, what will happen if I can't find it?! Will I remain invisible forever?!             Orion: Hmm, I once met a professor on the Warthogs server that was always invisible because of some kind of malfunction. She called it a “Chronic Illness” of Eternum.                                  Annie: Oh, thanks for the reassurance, Orion! I feel much, much better now! You sure know how to put a girl’s mind at ease! Now I can... A-Are you looking at my boobs??                                Orion: W-What? No!                                                                                  Annie: I'm invisible but I can still see you, you know?!                                            Orion: Um... Well, first of all, it's harder to look at your face when you don't exactly have one.  And... to be fair, that shirt of yours makes your breasts look... really good. You look so hot.     Annie: *Giggles* Really? T-Thank you! I'm glad that you like it. Can you focus and stop being a     pig?!                                                                                               Orion: Y-Yeah, sorry. I'm focused. What's the plan? Um... I'm no expert, but... I doubt it.         Annie: *Clears throat* Okay! I've got this under control! I'll go find the box and return to normal! In the meantime, you'll discover who the murderer is so we can leave this place before something   else crazy happens!                                                                                 Orion: Alright, I'll try. Oh, and if you find Nova... try to help her reverse the spell too. She    touched some weird artifact and now there are two copies of herself... or something like that.      Annie: Oh, wow! That sounds awesome! Okay, I'll help her too and then we'll solve this mystery      together!                                                                                           Orion: Just don't touch anything else!                                                              Annie: These grabbers, no more touchies! Pinky promise!                                             Orion: *Sighs* (Okay, I need to focus... I'm running out of time. The briefcase. A combination of 4 numbers... the multiplication of the youngest and the oldest guest ages... Got it. Fuck, I have no  time for this now, I have to discover who's the fucking impostor... Okay... how was that riddle...) Someone pushes you and you fall to the floor.                                                       Orion: Aghh... what the hell? *Turning around* What the fuck is wrong with... You... Oh wow...      Nova: Hi, Orion.                                                                                    Orion: Hi Nova... D-Did something happen? Are you back to being just one Nova again?                Nova: Does that matter? We're both the same person, remember? One mind, two bodies. You can feel and control both of your hands at the same time, can't you? It's the same concept.                     Orion: It's still hard to understand, but I guess that example makes it simpler. So... what happened to your dress?                                                                                     Nova: Nothing. I just thought you'd like to see me without it.                                      Orion: Well, you're not wrong...                                                                    Nova: *Straddling you* I thought we could use some time to breathe in the middle of all this chaos. Orion: That makes sense...                                                                          Nova sensually pulls her bra over her head.                                                         Orion: Wow...                                                                                       Nova eagerly starts bouncing against you, with her breath becoming rapid as she adds a deep,        seductive grind against your groin. Feeling your sudden erection only adds fuel to her fire as she  hungrily rubs against it.                                                                           Nova: *Giggles* Wow, that was a fast reaction...                                                    Orion: Oh my god...                                                                                 Nova: So... how long did Clonk say the rounds last? 10 minutes?                                     Orion: I-I think so, yeah...                                                                        Nova: Do you have any idea of things that we could do in such a short time?                         Orion: Do you...?                                                                                   Nova: Well... I think I could be quite a naughty girl for you. One who could ride you until you’re  completely spent.                                                                                   Orion: I-I see.                                                                                     Nova: Although... I doubt 10 minutes would be enough to satisfy my hunger for you. I have way too   much pent-up energy. We'd probably have to continue well into the next round...                     Orion: I could roll with that...                                                                    Nova: *Giggles* I can feel you poking me through your pants, Orion. Feeling your hard cock wedged up against me is making me feel so hot.                                                               Orion: Yeah... I can't help it.                                                                     Nova: I'm dying to feel you inside of me... I want you to fill me up completely... and let me feel  you from every angle. I need to enjoy you from every single position. I’m dying to feel every       pulse... every contour... every inch of your beautiful cock...                                      Orion: Oh god Nova...                                                                               Nova: And you? Can you give me what I want? Do you want to fulfill the hunger of your naughty little girl?                                                                                              Orion: Fuck, I do...                                                                                Nova: It's too bad we can't...                                                                      Orion: W-What? Why not?                                                                             Nova: S-S-S-STOP!!!                                                                                 Orion: (O-Oh. Shit, I almost forgot where I was for a second.)                                      Nova: Awwh... I guess the party pooper has arrived.                                                 Nova: W-What the fuck are you doing?!                                                               Nova: We both know what I was doing... we have a single mind, remember?                             Nova: S-So you know I'd stop you!                                                                   Nova: I knew you were coming, yeah... but I'll admit I'm surprised at how fast you managed to untie yourself.                                                                                           Nova: T-This is so embarrassing!                                                                    Nova: Come on, you can’t lie to me... You are every bit as horny as I am.                           Nova: N-No, I’m not!                                                                                Nova: Pleaaaase... look me in the eyes and tell me you don't want to suck his huge cock again...    Because I know I want to... soooo bad...                                                            Nova: C-Can you shut up and get dressed, please?!                                                   Nova: *Putting her bra back on* Okay, okay... jeez. With this attitude of yours we're never gonna be able to pop the “v-champagne”, y'know?                                                             Nova: I-I'm sorry, Orion. I don't know what happened to m... w-what happened to her. I mean... I'm  sorry, I d-didn't want this to happen.                                                              Nova: HAH! You just can't stop lying, can you?! You wanted this as much as me, girl! Like, why did  we buy these  pants, if not to catch Orion’s attention? We literally bought them with him in mind   because they accentuate our butt so wonderfully. *Pulling her latex leggings up* See? Don't you like them, Orion? I've been doing some squats the last few weeks.                                       Orion: Very much, yes...                                                                            Nova: O-Okay, t-that's enough! S-S-Sorry for bothering you, Orion!                                  Orion: You don't bo–                                                                                Nova: W-We'll keep trying to find a way to get back to normal! S-S-See you l-later!                 Orion: A-Alright! Be careful! (Damn, these artifacts sure are something else... Phew. But anyway, I need to refocus and get the blood flowing back to my brain. You can do it, Orion. Now where was     I...) “The oldest and the youngest I seek, multiply their years, don't be meek”... (And, unless     someone lied to me, Gemini is 71 years old and Nova is 21. I hope that's the answer... It worked!   Time to find out if the answer is inside this briefcase or not.) *Gulps* (The moment of truth.) No  way... (Another sticky note...? Really? That's it? With... another riddle on it... In the realm of  secrets and disguise, everyone holds a hidden lie. Delilah's true identity she hides with care,     Gemini's eyes see more than he dares to declare. Harley trembles at the slightest sound, while Anna wears a mask to conceal her tears unbound. And don't ask Sister about Sapphire, or her trickery will ultimately expire! Hmmm... okay... and what does all this mean?) *Standing up* (Dammit, I feel like I'm wasting my time. I have to go back to–)                                                        Annie: Orion!!                                                                                      Orion: AHH! A-Annie? Where are you?                                                                 Annie: Right in front of you! I'm still invisible!                                                  Orion: Oh! Wait, so... you're naked?                                                                Annie: U-Um... well, I took off my clothes to be able to investigate without being seen.            Orion: Ohh... Sexy...                                                                               Annie: Orion!                                                                                       Orion: *Chuckles* Well, and what did you find?                                                      Annie: Polyjuice potion! I found remains of it in the bathroom! And I know who's using it! Take this bottle! And open it when you're next to Anna Piaget!                                               Orion: The psychologist? Why?                                                                       Annie: Trust me!                                                                                    Orion: *Grabbing the bottle* Well, alright.                                                         Annie: What about you? Did you discover anything?                                                   Orion: *Giving the note to Annie* Just this weird riddle.                                           Annie: *Reading it* Delilah's true identity... wears a mask... ultimately expire... *Gasps* OF      COURSE! It has to be that!                                                                          Orion: What is it?                                                                                  Annie: Everybody is lying about something! You have to discover what each one of them is hiding!    Orion: But how? And what about you?                                                                 Annie: Just keep playing the game! And follow the clues of the sticky note! Just... buy me some     time, please! I'll be back!                                                                         Trust her and let her investigate                                                                   Orion: *Sighs* Alright, I trust you. But be careful!                                                Annie: I will!                                                                                      Ask her to turn back to normal                                                                      Orion: This is too dangerous, Annie. Find that box to become visible again and let's stay together! Annie: B-But! Agh, darn it, you're right! Okay, I'll go to the garden to find the box. I'll join you as soon as I'm back to normal!                                                                     Orion: Sounds good!                                                                                 You hear Annie running away.                                                                        Orion: Hmm... (Well, I'm not sure of what exactly I have to do, but... I'll try. Everyone is lying  about something, but only one person is the real murderer. One of them had to know The Collector    before coming here... and I have to discover WHO. I'll have to talk to Gemini and Harley... Fuck... I didn't ask Gemini his age and now he's dead... I guess this means one less lead to follow...)     *Taking a deep breath* Holy shit... I still can't believe we managed to get out of there alive.     Annie: Yeah, that was close...                                                                      Orion: Hey, we solved the case thanks to you!                                                       Nova: Hell yeah, that deduction was amazing, Annie! You're so awesome!                              Annie: We survived through the rounds thanks to you two as well, but... t-thanks, guys! Means a lot!Orion: I don't even know how long we've been playing, it felt like hours.                           Annie: Yep, we're probably way past bedtime. But I'm gonna go grab a glass of milk and some         chocolate cookies from the kitchen before going to bed, you want some?                              Orion: Sure, that sounds good! I'm starving.                                                        Annie: Cool! I'll log off then. This was scary but also very fun. I always feel very accomplished   after playing with you guys!                                                                        Nova: I feel the same way!                                                                          Annie: Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow!                                                              Orion: I still think there was something that doesn't add up there...                               Nova: Why do you think so?                                                                          Orion: I mean, why would a man who's about to die organize this whole madness? Mmh, I don't know,   maybe I'm just underestimating how weird people can be.                                             Annie: Well in any case, I think I'm gonna go grab a glass of milk and some chocolate cookies and go to bed. I'm exhausted.                                                                             Orion: Oh, can you grab some for me too? I'm hungry.                                                Annie: Of course! On it. This was scary but very fun, guys. See you tomorrow! Good night, guys.     Nova: Good night, Annie!                                                                            Annie uses the Exit Portal and returns to the real world.                                           Orion: Oh shit, are you okay, Nova? How's your eye?                                                 Nova: It's fine! No worries! I might have overextended it a bit, but you know how it works. I'll be as good as new as soon as I log off.                                                                Orion: Oh well, I'm glad to hear that.                                                              Nova: Thank you for helping us, Orion. We wouldn't have made it out here alive if it wasn't for you.Orion: Meh, all I did was point out people’s bullshit in a bizarre game.                            Nova: *Chuckles* Fair enough. Um... listen, I wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier. When I   was duplicated a part of me felt... crazier for some reason. I said things I didn't want to say. I  m-mean... things that weren't true.                                                                 Orion: You have nothing to apologize for.                                                           Nova: S-Still, I feel like I have to. So... let me make it up to you! Oh, and... listen, I wanted to ask you something before we log out. The last episode of One Piece comes out next Saturday, and I  was wondering if you wanted to... watch it with me. Like... at my house. I mean... I know you follow it too, so why watch it alone when you can have some good company! Plus, and here’s the best       part... I’ll  bring food and drinks!                                                                Orion: Psh, you had me at “good company”! That sounds awesome! I've been looking forward to watching it. *Chuckles* And after the bad impression I left at your house the first time I was there, I feel like I deserve a second chance. Count me in.                                                       Nova: A-Alright! Sounds good! I-I'll start preparing for it then!                                   Orion: Preparing...? It’s only Friday.                                                              Nova: Y-Yeah, well, you know, I gotta do some stuff... and then the things need the thingys...      otherwise those uhh... umm... A-Anyways! It’s getting late! This was super fun, but I'm very tired  and think I'll go to bed as well! So... yeah, night-night!                                          Orion: *Chuckles* Okay Nova, good night!                                                            Nova: Well, I'm calling it a day as well. See you tomorrow!                                         Orion: Take care, Nova! Good night! (I wonder if she's inviting more people or if it’ll be just the two of us. I guess I'll find out next Thursday... But anyway, it's my turn to leave. Well, it's my  turn to leave. Another crazy chapter for my Eternum memoirs. I won't miss the deadly lasers though, that's for sure...) *Stretching* (Mmmm... still raining.) *Sitting up* (Wow, as soon as you log off Eternum all the exhaustion suddenly hits you like a ton of bricks. It's easy to forget how fatigued you really are when you're in there. But tired or not, Annie mentioned milk and cookies, and I'm not one to say no to that!) *Lying down* (Now it's time to sleep for real. Big day tomorrow. I have to visit Alex's house and then follow another lead on a hypothetical Gem of Doom on that Western       server.) *Yawns* (I hope things go more smoothly there than tonight.) . . . (But somehow I...)      *Yawns* (I highly doubt it... Holy shit, what a storm. At least Kredon is used to it by now and it  rarely gets flooded.) *Knocking on the door* Annie?                                                 Annie: Come on in!                                                                                  Orion: *Closing the door* Ah, I was wondering when you'd turn this room into plushie paradise too.  Annie: *Chuckles* I just bought a couple of them! I'm still far from the 37 I have in my room in    London.                                                                                             Orion: A couple? I expected more from you, these are rookie numbers! I'll have to buy you a new one or three for Christmas.                                                                             Annie: *Giggles* Deal!                                                                              Orion: Well... I was promised cookies, but I don't see them anywhere.                               Annie: Yeah, about that... I went to the kitchen, but there were no chocolate chip cookies left.    Orion: Oh...                                                                                        Annie: But there were Oreos.                                                                        Orion: Oh! I can settle for that! *Jumping on Annie's bed* Did you see the girls on your way to the kitchen? Are they still awake?                                                                      Annie: All three of them are sprawled out on the couch. They fell asleep watching one of their TV   shows.                                                                                              Orion: *Eating an Oreo* That's cute. (They were all peacefully sleeping without knowing how close I was to losing our two Gems of Doom... Thank god it all ended well.) I love your hair, by the way!   Annie: This? Oh, please, it's just a quick and messy bun I threw up after I got home. B-But thank   you. It's cool to have longer hair. I wouldn't have been able to make a top knot like this when my  hair was shorter. Penelope has been teaching me different ways to style it too.                     Orion: Mind giving me a sneak peek of how it looks without the bun?                                 Annie: Not yet! I want to impress you when it's a liiitle bit longer.                               Orion: I've seen you with long hair in Eternum already!                                             Annie: Yeah, but this is different! It's crazy how fast hair grows in Kredon.                       Orion: *Eating another cookie* Mm-yeah, people mentioned how much my hair had grown during my visit too.                                                                                                Annie: So everything went well when you returned home this past week, then?                         Orion: Meh, I wanted to return to Kredon the moment the flight took off. I don't care if I find     discounted plane tickets again, I have no reason to go back there.                                  Annie: And how was your dad?                                                                        Orion: My dad...?                                                                                   Dad: Agh, why are we passing backward?! Move the ball forward, you fucking wanker!                  Orion: Um... hey Dad, I'm leaving. Going back to Kredon. The plane leaves in 4 hours.               Dad: Ah, you leaving already? Kay, have fun! Study hard and all that jazz.                          Orion: Sure.                                                                                        Dad: Tell Na- *Burps* Tell Nancy, Talia, and Persephone I said hi.                                  Orion: Their names are Dalia and Penelo–                                                            Dad: AGGHHH, for fuck's sake, how can you miss that, you bastard?! I didn’t know we had Stevie      Wonder on the team!                                                                                 Orion: . . .                                                                                        Dad: And why is this grandpa still playing?! He's a fucking mummy! Just give Oliveira a chance, let the kid play!                                                                                       Orion: . . . So... yeah, you know how my father is.                                                 Annie: Awh, I'm so sorry, Orion... I can’t imagine how that must’ve felt after traveling all that   way.                                                                                                Orion: Don't be sorry!                                                                              My true family is here in Kredon                                                                    Orion: You, Nancy, Dalia, Penelope... everyone that matters to me most is here in Kredon.           Annie: You know... that’s really sweet of you to say. Thank you.                                    I prefer not to talk about it                                                                       Orion: I prefer not to talk about it.                                                               Annie: O-Of course! I didn't mean to pry, I'm sorry.                                                Orion: No worries!                                                                                  You know dads can be real assholes                                                                  Orion: You know as well as I do that dads can be real assholes.                                     Annie: W-Well... it's true that my dad has been working a lot all his life and he's been a bit      absent, but... he's always cared about me. And he thinks highly of you!                             Orion: Well... yeah, I guess that's different. That came out wrong, I'm sorry.                      Annie: No worries! I know you didn't mean it in a bad way.                                          Orion: Anyway, changing the subject... how are your guitar lessons going?                           Annie: Oh... well, I-I'm still learning. I'm still in the “butchering guitar chords” phase.         Orion: I'm sure you're better than you say! Can't you play me anything?                             Annie: N-Not yet! You'd hate it.                                                                    Orion: No, I wouldn't!                                                                              Annie: S-Still, not yet! Give me a few weeks of practice.                                           Orion: *Laughs* Okay, okay, I'll wait...                                                            Annie: *Standing up* Let's just eat these cookies instead! You want some milk?                      Orion: Sure!                                                                                        Annie: I can't eat Oreos without dunking... Huh? Where's the milk? I left it right here on the      nightstand.                                                                                         Orion: You mean those glasses on the floor?                                                         Annie: What? WHAT?! What happened there? Where's the milk?!                                         Carolyn: *Meows*                                                                                    Carolyn appears from behind the bed and jumps on the covers, sporting traces of milk still on her   whiskers.                                                                                           Annie: *Gasps* CAROLYN! Did you drink our milk?!                                                    Carolyn: *Purrs*                                                                                    Annie: No! Bad! BAD KITTY! You can't eat our snackies! BAD GIRL! BAD, BAD... . . .                  Carolyn: . . .                                                                                      Annie: AWWWWW LOOK AT HOW CUTE THE LITTLE PRINCESS IS! How could you ever be mad at such a stinkin’ cute little kitty face?! Don't worry Carolyn, you can drink all the milk you want! Good girl!       Carolyn: *Happily meows*                                                                            Orion: So... what now? Should we go get more milk?                                                  Annie: I think there's only one carton left, and that one is actually Carolyn's.                    Orion: Yeah, but well, it's normal milk, isn't it?                                                  Annie: Yeah, it is, it's not a special formula for cats or anything.                                Orion: We can get that one, then. She drank some milk tonight already. It's not as if she's gonna   die if tomorrow she doesn't have any... . . . O-Okay, okay! W-We won't drink your milk either, stop making that face!                                                                                   Annie: Awhhh... If we don't have milk, I don't think I want any cookies... Now my whole night is    ruined.                                                                                             Orion: *Laughs* Don't be so dramatic. They're still good without milk.                              Annie: But it’s not the same...                                                                     Orion: *Eating your last cookie* Well, suit yourself. I think they're delicious either way! But     anyway, I guess I should really go to sleep now.                                                    Annie: What? Already?                                                                               Orion: Well, tomorrow I'm supposed to go meet Alex pretty early and play with her and Dalia in that Wild West server. Supposedly that’s where a Gem is hidden.                                          Annie: Oh... y-yeah, the mission! Of course. I forgot.                                              Orion: I mean... I can stay if you want me to.                                                      Annie: No, no! I don't want you to. I mean... there's no need.                                      Orion: You sure? We c–                                                                              Annie: Absolutely sure! There's nothing else I need to discuss with you! But I enjoyed hanging out  at least! I'm glad you're back, and... Yeah, it's bedtime! Good night, Orion!                       Orion: Um... well, okay then. Good night, Annie! *Standing up* (Mmm, was it something I said? We    haven't really talked much since that time in Andromeda, I'm not sure where-)                       Annie: WAIT! Umm... d-don't go!                                                                     Orion: Huh? What's the matter?                                                                      Annie: *Clears throat* I mean, you can go... but before you do... I just thought that... Well, I’ve had a lot of time to myself this past week and... I’ve been thinking a lot... and feeling a lot     of... umm, feelings... eheh... And I was wondering if we possibly, by chance, maybe... c-continue   our little practice sessions?                                                                       Orion: Practice... like with the guitar?                                                            Annie: N-No. Not the guitar. I mean... remember last time in Andromeda? When you taught me...       certain things? And made me feel... certain ways?                                                   Orion: How could I forget...                                                                        Annie: Well... I thought that... maybe... we’re a little overdue for some more... p-practice.       Like... kissing, or... you know, k-kissing with some tongue too.                                    Orion: Ah... that kind of “practicing”...                                                           Annie: Yeah, I mean... What if Dalia suddenly kisses me one day? With my severe lack of practice,   I'd only embarrass myself.                                                                          Orion: You want to kiss Dalia?                                                                      Annie: Y-You know what I mean!                                                                      Orion: *Chuckles* I'm honestly not sure.                                                            Annie: D-Don't make fun of me!                                                                      Orion: It's you who keeps going in circles, dancing around what you’re really getting at! Why don't you just tell me what you really want? Be direct.                                                   Annie: *Taking a deep breath* Hnnn... I... I want you to kiss me.                                   Orion: See? It wasn't so hard. *Chuckles* Now come here, silly girl.                                Annie gets closer to you. Her alluring blue eyes gaze deeply into yours, as she playfully begins    swinging her petite hips.                                                                           Orion: (Sometimes I forget how small Annie is. She was wearing heels in that server the whole time, so I guess that also created the illusion of her being taller.) You need to be more direct, Annie.  Annie: I’m trying! I-It's just that... I don't want to make things awkward or anything.             Orion: I've told you about a hundred times the way I feel about you. There's no way you can make    things uncomfortable between us.                                                                    Annie: I-I know...                                                                                  Orion: (I shouldn't be so afraid to make the first move either when it comes to Annie. She's told me how she feels as well, after all.) *Picking her up* Alright, so... you told me you want to practice kissing again, is that correct?                                                                    Annie: Yes sir...                                                                                   Orion: And do you have any preference on who you practice with? I've heard Professor Keating is such a good kisser.                                                                                     Annie: *Giggles* I’ll have to take your word on that one. As for me, I only want it to be you.      Orion: Oh... Well, that makes things easier...                                                      You lean in, and your lips meet in a soft, tender kiss.                                             Annie: Mmmm...                                                                                      Without your lips ever parting, you carry Annie towards her bed and both of you fall back onto the  soft mattress.                                                                                      Annie: *Sitting up* I missed you so much. Being back in your embrace... it’s just what I needed.    Orion: Me too...                                                                                    Annie: Do you mind if I... get a little more comfortable? You should know... for some reason this   outfit always feels a bit itchy against my skin.                                                    Orion: Ah, yes, I remember... Maybe you should just stop wearing these pajamas altogether.          Annie: *Giggles* Yeah, maybe I will start going to sleep naked.                                     Orion: That sounds like a really good idea...                                                       Annie: But you know, if I do that, I get cold really easily... I’d need someone to keep me warm...  Orion: (I like seeing Annie growing in confidence, teasing and joking around.) Oh boy... I’ll never get tired of seeing your gorgeous body, Annie.                                                      Annie: T-Thank you...                                                                               Orion: Now, where were we...?                                                                       Without answering your question, Annie eagerly pounces on you and resumes the kiss.                 Annie: Mmmmmhm...                                                                                   Orion: (Her soft skin feels so warm... I can’t keep my hands from tracing her every outline. She's  so light, but at the same time I can feel all of her beautiful curves tightly hugging my body. I can tell she wants this as much as me.)                                                                As time goes by, Annie summons more and more confidence and lustfully deepens the kiss.             Annie: *Slight moan* Mmmm...                                                                        Orion: (Feeling her heart pounding is so intoxicating. I just want to hold her tighter... I want her to feel how much I desire her...)                                                                  Annie: Mmm... *Breaking the kiss* I...                                                              Orion: All good?                                                                                    Annie: I want... I want to do that thing again.                                                     Orion: That “thing”?                                                                                Annie: In Andromeda. I w-want you to... I need to feel your finger i-inside of me again.            Orion: Naughty girl...                                                                              You grab Annie and throw her onto the bed.                                                          Orion: We're gonna have to make ourselves even more comfortable for that. *Taking your shirt off*   You don't mind if I take this thing off, right?                                                     Annie: Nuh-uh...                                                                                    Orion: Now... as much as I like those cute pajamas, I'm afraid we'll have to get rid of them.       Annie looks at her pants and, after a moment's hesitation, slowly starts slipping them off.         Orion: Oh my... No panties, eh? Were you expecting this to happen?                                  Annie: Perhaps...                                                                                   Orion: Fuck, I just want to explore every inch of you...                                            Annie: I... I'm n-not sure I'm ready, Orion.                                                        Orion: Ready for what?                                                                              Annie: You know what I mean... Ready for... sex.                                                    Orion: Like I’ve told you before, we can take it as slow as you want. I’m only going to accept      however much you’re willing to give. I want you to feel safe. I just want to take you to a place    where you can let go of your shyness, your inhibitions, and truly embrace your desires without      reservation. And until then... you set the pace.                                                    Annie: . . .                                                                                        As if you had pronounced some magic words, Annie's legs slowly open for you and you’re again blessed with a sight that no other man has seen before.                                                    Orion: Oh Annie... (God... I just want to devour all of her.) *Pulling Annie towards you* Come      here...                                                                                             Annie: W-WHAT? Wait! I said I'm not ready! I just wanted the same thing we did in Andromeda!        Orion: I know. We can do that... but maybe instead of a finger, we can try it with something else   you were playing with earlier. You'll see...                                                        Annie: What?! Are you gonna use your mouth... your tongue... on my...?                              Orion: I’m dying to taste you, Annie.                                                               Annie: Orion, I... I-I'm not sure if I'm ready for that either! W-What if you don’t like the way I  taste? O-Or what if I feel strange or...                                                            You start sliding your tongue between Annie's outer lips.                                           Orion: There’s no way such a beautiful girl like you...                                             Your tongue slowly starts grazing around her wet pussy.                                             Orion: Could taste anything other than amazing...                                                   Annie: I'm... Not... Reaaaaddyyy... Oh Orion... that feels... Oh my GOD! MMmmmm... Oh god...        You begin to taste every inch of Annie, spreading her tight lips as you gracefully move your tongue back and forth.                                                                                     Orion: (Maybe I should have started slower.)                                                        Annie: *Moaning* Mmmm-aahh-mmm...                                                                   Orion: (Although she doesn't seem to mind...)                                                       Annie: Oh my god, Orion...                                                                          Orion: (I fucking love her taste...)                                                                Annie: AAaahh... how are you doing that... Y-Your tongue feels so... aaAaahhh...                    Orion: (Maybe now I could try focusing on her clit. Her thighs seem to keep pushing my mouth toward it... Here we go...)                                                                                Annie: AAAAGH! What's that! *Grabbing your head* STOP!                                              Orion: You don't like it?                                                                           Annie: NO! I mean... d-don’t stop... Orion. . . . . . . . . . .  . !                                Annie's body language screams of ecstasy as you continue attacking her swollen clit.                Annie: Oh godddddd... Mmmmmm... Oh yes. OH... FUCK YES! Please don't stop! Keep doing what you're   doing... WHATEVER IT IS! Eat me whole...                                                            Orion: (Oh boy... It's so tempting to let go of the reins and allow my desires to consume me,       permitting nothing but passion to drive us both wild.... But I have to resist the urge, for now. I  know Annie better than herself, and I know she’s really close but not quite ready to go all the way. This moment is about more than just my pleasure. Although... I'm not sure how long I'll be able to hold out...)                                                                                        Annie: *Loudly moaning* AAAAaaaaGH... aaahhh...                                                     Orion: (Thank god it's storming outside, otherwise it’d be nearly impossible to not hear her moans  throughout the house...)                                                                            Annie: AAaahh... oh god Orion... I think I'm gonna... C-CUM... Again... Orion! You’re gonna make    me... I can feel it coming... Aaah... AAAaahhh... AAAAARRRHHHGGHH... MY GOD! HEAVENS! WHAT... WHAT  WAS THAT?! That was... soooo... amazing...                                                          Orion: *Muffled* Y-You're kind of crushing my skull with your thighs... (How the hell are her legs  so strong?!)                                                                                        You move aside and let Annie collapse on the bed after her orgasm.                                  Annie: Wow... M-My legs are still shaking. I almost forgot where we were...                         Orion: *Sitting on the edge of the bed* See? You just have to trust me.                             Annie: I guess you're right... *Sitting up and crawling towards you* I guess from now on I should... . . . W-W-When did you lose your pants?!                                                           Orion: Shortly after I started going down on you... You didn't notice?                              Annie: N-Not at all.                                                                                Orion: I guess you were too absent-minded...                                                        Annie: I-It looks... It looks as big as it was in Eternum.                                          Orion: I'd be surprised if something didn't look the same as in Eternum. We're literally an         identical replica of ourselves in there.                                                            Annie: I know, I meant that... It's still big.                                                      Orion: Do you want to... give me another handjob?                                                   Annie: . . . I mean... it’s only fair that... Since you got to use your tongue, I should be able to use mine too...                                                                                     Orion: Fuck, I was hoping you'd say that so much...                                                 Annie slowly positions herself on your side and lightly touches your dick with the tip of her       tongue.                                                                                             Annie: *Sniffs* Your scent is just so... alluring... Aaahh...                                       Orion: Yes...                                                                                       Annie eagerly starts lapping up your shaft.                                                         Orion: Oh, fuck yes...                                                                              Annie: *Slight moan* Mmmm...                                                                        Orion: Oh Annie...                                                                                  Annie: It's so slippery... And... I can feel you pulsing, Orion...                                  Orion: Because I'm so fucking horny for you right now...                                            Annie: There's no way I can fit all of you inside of my mouth...                                    Orion: You'd be surprised how much you can take...                                                  Annie: Mmmmh... Y-You’re just too thick.                                                            Orion: Don't you wanna try it...? Please, just the tip... I’m dying to feel your lips wrapped around me...                                                                                              Annie: Aaaahhh... that does sound... good... I guess... I guess I could try...                      Orion: Attagirl...                                                                                  Annie: *Breathing noticeably faster* Alright... I’ll give it a shot... only for you...              Orion: Please...                                                                                    Annie slowly envelopes the tip of your cock between her soft lips before taking more of it inside   her small, warm mouth. She struggles a bit at first, but then quickly becomes accustomed to it.     Orion: Yeah, just like t-that... Now take it deeper... AAAAAHHH... HOT DAMN... Oh my fucking god,   this can't be real... I can’t believe you’re actually... Oh, baby, yes...                           Annie: *Moaning* MMmmmmMMMmm... *Taking a deep breath* AAaahh...                                    Orion: No, don't stop, please...                                                                    Annie: I... I n-need to catch my breath!                                                            Orion: Oh... I t–                                                                                   Annie shuts you up quickly by eagerly fitting as much of your dick as she can into her mouth again. Orion: F-FUCK... Yeah... keep going... suck it as hard as you can, babe...                          Annie: *Sucking harder* Mmmmh...!                                                                   Orion: (This sensation is unreal... I can feel Annie's lips stretched to the max... her small mouth completely filled by my cock...)                                                                    Annie: *Choking* Mmmm... mmmm... mmmmhh...                                                          Orion: (She's getting it so wet... she really seems to be savoring it...) Good girl... That's it... Breathe through your nose... Just don't stop... (My god... She's gonna drive me crazy...)           Annie: *Moaning* Mmmhm...                                                                           Orion: (I can feel her getting more comfortable and confident with herself as time goes by... She's enjoying this as much as me.)                                                                       Annie: MMmmMmMmmhm....                                                                              Orion: (Should I push her limits? Or let her find her own rhythm?)                                  Let her find her own rhythm                                                                         Orion: (I should let her take the reins on this... but maybe a little feedback wouldn’t hurt.)      *Panting* Annie...?                                                                                 Annie: Hmm?                                                                                         Orion: D-Do you think you can go a little bit faster? I'm almost there...                           Annie obediently shifts gears and sloppily sucks your cock much faster, taking it as deep down her  throat as she can. Push her limits                                                                  Orion: (Fuck it, I can't restrain myself anymore...) AHHHHHHGG.... NOW WE'RE TALKING...             You grab Annie's head and start fucking her mouth. You can hear her choking with each thrust, but   Annie's throat willingly takes all of you.                                                          Orion: HOLY FUCK... O-Oh my god... That's it...                                                     Annie: *Choking* Hnng... mmmh... hhnng?                                                             Orion: N-Not sure what you asked, b-but... FUCK YES!                                                Annie: *Choking* Hnng... hnnggg... hhhnnnggg!                                                       Orion: F-Fuck YES! Take it all... GOOD GIRL... (My god... this is really happening... The sweet,    innocent, little girl I've known for years... The same one that used to blush and hide every time   anything even remotely sexual was mentioned... Is here milking my cock like a mad woman... Is here  letting me use her mouth to milk my cock...) Come on Annie, you're gonna miss the entire movie!     Annie: B-But that guy is... n-naked! T-They showed his...                                           Orion: The scene is over, don't worry!                                                              Annie: Y-you sure?                                                                                  Orion: Yes! AAAAargh... fuck, Annie... That's it... suck it until it's dry...                       Annie: *Choking* MMmmmmmmmhhh...                                                                    Annie's father: You better take care of my little girl while you're in the USA, Orion.              Orion: Rest assured Mr. Winters, I won’t let anything happen to her! I'll take care of Annie as if  she was my sister!                                                                                  Annie: *Choking* MMMmmMhhhHh!                                                                       Orion: Oh GOD, Annie, I'm gonna fucking cum!                                                        Annie: Mmmmmhh... *Catching her breath* AAAAaaaAAAArgHhhh... *Catching her breath* I c-can't... take it... anymore...                                                                                   You pull Annie to the floor as she collapses, completely exhausted, right in front of you.          Annie: *Panting* A-Are you... gonna... finish on m-me...?                                           Orion: I want to... Can I...?                                                                       Annie: *Panting* Yeah... *Panting* Do it... empty y-yourself all over me, Orion...                  Orion: Oh god Annie, I'm... I'M ALMOST... AAAAAAHHHH... Jeez...                                     Annie: H-Holy cow... You... released... a lot...                                                    Orion: (Man, I love seeing her slim body covered in my cum.) You okay? Sorry, I couldn't really hold back there...                                                                                      Annie: Yeah... I-It's okay. It tastes... weird. I mean, not bad, just umm... different. I can't     really liken it to anything I've had before. *Standing up* Oh god, my jaw hurts...                  Orion: Yeah... that ended up being pretty intense... I hope I didn't overdo it there. But my god, I have to say... that felt unbelievably good.                                                         Annie: R-Really? It c-couldn't have been that big of a deal, right...?                              Orion: Are you kidding me? Goddammit Annie... that was mind-blowing.                                Annie: Oh... well t-thanks. I mean... I'm glad. I didn't know I could make someone feel like that. I actually had a lot of fun too. Maybe even too much... I forgot to lock the door.                   Orion: Well, I'm sure Dalia and Penelope would knock before entering your room. Not so sure about   Nancy though... Let's just say she has a bad history with closed doors.                             Annie: Still, w-we should be more careful. Imagine if Nancy had caught us... she'd kick us out of   the house!                                                                                          Orion: *Snorts* I highly doubt that. Why would she? We weren't doing anything wrong. And besides,   knowing Nancy, I think it's more probable that she'd ask to join in rather than giving us the boot! Annie: Orion! Don't be nasty!                                                                       Orion: *Chuckles* Okay, okay.                                                                       Annie: Do you think she'd really ask that, though...? It's true that she can be quite passionate,   but...                                                                                              Orion: Huh...? Do I sense some... interest?                                                         Annie: O-Of course not! I was just... digressing.                                                   Orion: Ah yeah, of course...                                                                        Annie: *Clears throat* Anyway, I'm gonna take a shower! I can't really go to bed like this... you've made quite the mess of me.                                                                         Orion: Of course. Good night, Annie. Thank you for an amazing night.                                Annie: Oh, before I leave... I wanted to say something.                                             Orion: What is it?                                                                                  She slowly approaches you, raises herself onto her tiptoes, and leans into your shoulder.           Orion: Are you okay?                                                                                Annie: Next time...                                                                                 Orion: Huh?                                                                                         Annie: *Whispering* Next time... I'll be ready for you.                                             Annie rushes out and heads towards the bathroom.                                                    Orion: (Oh my god... That literally gave me goosebumps. I was feeling completely spent, but after   hearing that, now I'm getting all wound up again. And then people ask me why I want to stay in      Kredon. I don't think I can get the thought of “next time” out of my head for a while...) *Sighs* (I guess now it's finally time to hit the sack. Let's see if I can manage to sleep after this. What a day... I can't believe we're a month away from Christmas already. But well, at least I won’t have to empty my bank account. Nancy made us all promise that we wouldn’t do gifts this year, and instead  we’d all celebrate the holiday with a ski trip weekend. Dalia, on the other hand... her birthday is on January 1. Man, having your birthday on New Year’s Day has to be a real bummer. Even if people   still wish you a happy birthday... it has to feel way less “special”. And not to mention, if you    want to do anything fun, most people are nursing their hangovers after a night of celebrating.      Perhaps I could surprise her by celebrating it a week earlier? Maybe before Christmas. I'm sure she wouldn't expect that and would appreciate the gesture. I should get her something too. She was      complaining the other day about her current protein powder. I think she was eyeing a much cleaner,  natural kind, but it was way beyond her budget. I'm sure she'd like that, and it'd motivate her to  train even harder. I know she’s been trying to bulk up her arms for a while now, and hasn’t made    much progress. Now, what flavor should I choose... Vanilla, cookies and cream, peanut butter...     Barbecue ribs...? Kale and wheatgrass sundae?? These people must be running out of ideas.)          Kale                                                                                                Orion: (That sounds so crazy that it must be worth a try. Maybe it’s a new hipster flavor or        something.)                                                                                         Vanilla                                                                                             Orion: (No one dislikes vanilla. You can't go wrong with the classics.)                             Barbecue                                                                                            Orion: (I mean... I have seen her completely devour a whole rack of barbecue ribs in less than 5    minutes. This sounds like her.)                                                                     Don't buy her anything                                                                              Orion: (Oof, this is way more expensive than I thought. I should save the money. Alright, one less  thing to worry about. This damn bus is sure taking its sweet time. I hope Alex doesn't get pissed   off if I'm late.)                                                                                   Your phone buzzes.                                                                                  Orion: Hmm? (Oh, speak of the devil... Damn, what a downer. I was looking forward to seeing her new place. I mean, she said not to go, but I can't help wondering if she really meant that. Maybe she's just too stubborn to ask for help.)                                                                 Get some meds and blankets and visit her anyway                                                     Orion: (Worth a shot. Worst case, she’ll slam the door in my face.)                                 Forget it and go home                                                                               Orion: (It's probably better to give her space. No girl wants people to see her face when she’s ill. I'll just go back home and log into Eternum there.)                                                Chang: MY MAN!                                                                                      Orion: Mmm? *Standing up* Hey my dude! What are you doing here? Weren't you going hiking with       Micaela today?                                                                                      Chang: We had to call it off due to the rain. I mean, we have raincoats and gear to stay dry, but   the news is saying there’s a major storm brewing for this afternoon. It’ll be a huge downpour, even for Kredon’s standards.                                                                             Orion: Awh, that's too bad. And what are you doing now? Any back-up plan?                           Chang: Well... I thought about inviting her to the movies but I ran out of money. My gig at the gym doesn't pay much, unfortunately.                                                                    Orion: Oh...                                                                                        Lend Chang $25                                                                                      Orion: Hey, take $25 and take your girl to the movies.                                              Chang: Oh shit, are you serious?!                                                                   Orion: Of course! Your happiness is my happiness. And besides, you're always helping me, it's the   least I can do.                                                                                     Chang: You're the best, Orion, thank you.                                                           Orion: Don't even mention it.                                                                       Chang: Now I'm even more stoked to give you this special something-something! I've gotta go then, my day suddenly got very busy! Lots of things to do instead! Not everybody can get As without         studying, or build muscle without training at least 5 times a week.                                 Don't lend him money                                                                                Orion: That really sucks. I'm sorry.                                                                Chang: No worries! I'll think of something else to do. What's important right now is the special    something-something I've got for you. But anyways, I've gotta go. Lots of things to do instead! Not everybody can get As without studying, or build muscle without training at least 5 times a week.    Orion: Huh?                                                                                         Chang: THE SHIRTS ARE READY!                                                                        Orion: Eh? What shi– O-Ohh, the matching T-shirts!                                                  Chang: I already gave Penelope and Luna theirs at the mall. They were actually the ones who told me you'd be here. I wasn't sure about your size since you're growing bigger and bigger by the day, so I went with a large, even though you always used to rock a medium.                                   Orion: Oh, so you've noticed it too! I did get stronger! I thought I was going crazy.               Chang: Of course! Nothing wrong with a bro ‘mirin your progress. Of course! Nothing wrong with a bro ‘mirin your progress. You've changed a lot since you got to Kredon.                                Orion: Well, I wouldn't say I’ve changed that much. Apart from more muscle, I'm exactly the same.   Chang: Are you kidding me? You don't look at yourself in the mirror?                                Orion: What?                                                                                        Chang: Your skin looks drier and your nails have darkened.                                          Orion: My nails...?                                                                                 Chang: You're definitely looking more swole, almost like you've been testing some sketchy           supplements at the gym. You got yourself some big-ass eyebags like you haven't been sleeping        properly for a whole month. And your hair’s growing super fast, you always look messy.              Orion: Ah... I-I thought you meant I changed in good ways.                                          Chang: I did, I did! Ladies love the laid-back, casual style... and you're rocking it! Looking more fit is always good, and the eyebags give you a mysterious, sexy look. Plus, that hairdo?? You know  how many men have gone to hair stylists hoping to get that look? With that front SWOOP?! It SWOOPS  so effortlessly... You look great, man!                                                             Orion: *Chuckles* Well, if you say so. Thanks for the self-esteem boost.                            Chang: Anyways, I really have to go now. Do you wanna see the shirt before I go, though?            Orion: Of course!                                                                                   Chang: *Clears throat* Behold... The best piece of clothing your eyes have ever seen... Whether     you’re going to a wedding, a funeral, a marathon, or on a date with the love of your life... No     matter the occasion, you’ll be able to wear... *Taking his jacket off* THIS. Reinforced seams and   stitching, a patented breathable 100% cotton-blend material, and it can be washed in hot or cold    water without any compromise to its quality. Made in Kredon! Organic and fair trade!                Orion: Oh damn! *Laughs* That's so freaking cool! *Looking at all the shirts* I love them!          Chang: Really? The design is mine!                                                                  Orion: *Laughs* Amazing. They're hilarious.                                                         Chang: Do you wanna try yours?                                                                      Orion: Sure! Hand me it and then I'll try it on at home.                                            Chang: Try it now.                                                                                  Orion: *Putting the shirt on* O-Okay, okay! Oh, it fits like a glove.                               Chang: It really does! Do you like it then?                                                         Orion: Love it!                                                                                     Chang: Phew, glad to hear that! I'll give the rest of the T-shirts to the other girls whenever I see them.                                                                                              Orion: *Putting your shirt back on* Sounds good! I'll text you later, buddy. Thanks for the shirts. And enjoy the movie with Micaela!                                                                   Chang: Thank you! Good luck in the Wild West server! I hope you find that Gem.                      Orion: Of course! See you later, buddy. And enjoy the movie with Micaela!                           Chang: Thank you! Good luck in the Wild West server! I hope you find that Gem.                      Orion: Fingers crossed! *Sitting down* (Alright... where was I... Ah, yeah, I've gotta buy some     ibuprofen and decongestants for Alex before going to her house.) *Checking Google Maps* (Hmm... the nearest pharmacy is the one on Emerald Street. Ah, yeah, I should go back home to log into Eternum  with Dalia and Alex.) *Checking Google Maps* (Hmm... I'll go back on foot, it's just a 20-minute    walk.)                                                                                              Your phone buzzes.                                                                                  Orion: (Penny?) *Snorts* (Who would have guessed those two would have gotten along so well. They're like... peanut butter and jelly. But I'm glad. I know they've been playing together in Warthogs     these past few weeks. And they were both wearing Chang's shirts in that pic. That's kind of         adorable.) *Grabbing your umbrella and standing up* Alright, time to go. (That Gem isn’t going to   just magically appear in our inventory. I'm excited to play again with...) What... Axel...? Damn,   you look... like shit.                                                                              Axel: Yeah, I... haven't been sleeping very well lately.                                            Orion: What the fuck dude, where have you been? You haven't been to school in weeks. I asked Alex,  but she didn't know anything either.                                                                Axel: I know. I've been... busy.                                                                    Orion: Ah... okay.                                                                                  Axel: . . .                                                                                         Orion: So... you got anything to say? Or are you just wandering around town looking like that,      hoping to experience the life of a hobo?                                                            Axel: . . . How... How did Benjamin die?                                                            Orion: *Laughs* Fuck me, REALLY?! Oh my god, and here I thought you were going through some tough   situation, but I see you’re still the same idiot. I've told you a hundred times, I DIDN'T–          Axel: I know you didn't kill him. But I also know that there’s more you aren’t telling me. I am     aware that Benjamin was a piece of shit. No one gave a fuck about his death, not even his family. He probably even deserved what happened to him. But... he also was the only one who I could call a    friend. I deserve to know what really happened to him.                                              Orion: Why would I tell you anything?                                                               Axel: You want info about Ulysses? About the things they're doing? The things they want to do?      Orion: What...?                                                                                     Axel: I've been investigating, digging into what my father has been scheming. And I can... delve    into it more. If you share what you know.                                                           Orion: William Bardot...                                                                            Axel: Look, I'm not asking to become best buddies. I know you don't exactly have warm feelings      towards me, and fuck, I don't like you one bit either. I'm not trying to redeem myself or some shit like that. All I’m asking for... is an exchange of information.                                     Orion: . . .                                                                                        Tell him what you know                                                                              Orion: Even if I told you, you wouldn't believe me.                                                 Axel: I could say the same thing.                                                                   Orion: *Sighs* Okay... Benjamin... was excommunicated. We believe that the Praetorians have a way to kill you both in Eternum and the real world at the same time. And when that happens... your        consciousness gets trapped in the game. You become...                                               Axel: An NPC.                                                                                       Orion: Yes...                                                                                       Axel: So it's true...                                                                               Orion: Wait... you knew this?                                                                       Axel: Listen now, you fucking halfwit... Eternum... is not a game.                                  Orion: What...?                                                                                     Axel: A game like Eternum would require a gargantuan network, with tens of thousands of             enterprise-level servers working in parallel within gigantic data centers. The amount of processing power that’d be required to run such a game would be unfathomable. And yet... there is nothing.     Nothing.                                                                                            Orion: Then... how is the game running?                                                             Axel: Whatever Eternum is... it's not digital. And Ulysses... somehow... found a way to access it   through the neural implant.                                                                         Orion: *Mocking chuckle* You're telling me that... Eternum is like... a parallel dimension? Because that sounds a bit...                                                                                Axel: I don't know what it is. Only The Founder seems to know its secrets. That's why my father is  obsessed with the Gems of Doom.                                                                     Orion: Your father wants to gather the Gems of Doom? Why?                                           Axel: He wants to claim ownership of the company and be able to control everything. As he has always done.                                                                                              Orion: But if your theory is true... What is Eternum, truly? Who is The Founder? And what about the Praetorians? Idriel? Were they all human once? Is someone controlling them? Are the NPCs aware of   their very nature and existence? (What about Calypso...?)                                           Axel: I... do not know. I'll keep investigating my father. I think... I think he knows more than    what he claims.                                                                                     Orion: I see... We'll let you know what we discover too.                                            Axel: Hmm.                                                                                          Tell him to fuck off                                                                                Orion: I have a better idea: why don't you shut the fuck up and get out of my sight? That is, unless you want me to punch your sad little face again.                                                   Axel: . . .                                                                                         Orion: If you really thought I'd just welcome you with open arms into our group and start telling   you all I know, just because you're all apologetic now, you were very much mistaken.                Axel: You fucking half-wit...                                                                       Orion: Ah, showing your true colors again, eh? You won't fool me. Get lost.                         Axel turns around, lifting his head towards the falling rain as he tries to maintain his proud      posture.                                                                                            Axel: . . . How's Alexandra?                                                                        Orion: What?                                                                                        Axel: My sister. She left home a few days ago, but I know you've been hanging out with her.         Orion: Oh... Well, she caught a cold today, but other than that... she's doing fine.                Axel: I see.                                                                                        Orion: . . . Do you want me to pass along any message to her?                                       Axel: . . . No. Not really.                                                                         Orion: She's fine.                                                                                  Axel: . . . I see.                                                                                  Axel continues walking away until he rounds the corner and you lose sight of him.                   Orion: *Sighs* (It feels like for every question regarding Eternum that we manage to answer, four   more arise. Not a game...? I don't even know what to think anymore. Fuck that guy. We're perfectly  capable of handling things on our own. We don't need his help for anything. Although... I wonder    what he discovered about his father or Ulysses...) . . . (Anyway, let's head out to Alex's house.   Anyway, let's head back home. Maybe a little walk will clear my mind.) *Looking at your phone*      (And... yep, this is the place! 41 Oak Street, Apartment 25. This looks nice! A bit far from the    center, but it's in a good part of the town. I guess that Alex is still a classy girl after all,    even if she cut herself off from that life. But anyway, the rain has drenched me enough already.    Let's see how this fancy place looks from the inside! W-What the fuck...)                           Neighbor: *Screams* AAAAAHHH!                                                                       Neighbor: Shut up, you crazy bitch!                                                                 Neighbor: Or what?! You won’t be able to talk to me like that after I go on TV and tell my story!   Neighbor: Haha! No one gives a fuck about your story, you stupid whore!                             Neighbor: I'LL CUT OFF YOUR TINY LITTLE WEINER WHILE YOU SLEEP, YOU HEAR ME?!                       Neighbor: *Punching the wall* HEY, SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY! I'M TRYING TO SLEEP!                   Neighbor: DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO, YOU CRUSTY ASS CUNT!                                            Neighbor: WHAT DID YOU SAY?!                                                                        Neighbor: DID I STUTTER?!                                                                           Neighbor: OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?! THAT KID ISN’T EVEN YOURS YOU DUMB PIECE OF SHIT! SOMEONE ELSE HAS    BEEN TAKING HER TO POUND TOWN AS SOON AS YOU LEAVE FOR WORK!!                                       Neighbor: WHAT?! IS THAT WHY UNCLE JOHN WAS HERE THE OTHER DAY?!!                                   Neighbor: THAT MOTHERFUCKER IS LYING!                                                               Orion: . . . *Gulps* (I-Is this really the right place...? Where the hell did Alex choose to live?! Maybe I got the wrong floor... let's see... Apartment 25... no, it's here. I'm not sure what I'll   find in there. It's either going to be Alex or an Albanian drug lord with a Glock 19 pointed at my  head. Please be the former...)                                                                      After realizing there's no bell, you knock on the door.                                             Orion: . . . (Weird. Maybe she left?) *Knocking again* Hello? Alex? It’s Orion!                     Alex: *In a congested voice* Orion?                                                                 Orion: Hi there!                                                                                    Alex: *Nasally voice* What the hell are you doing here? I told you not to come.                     Orion: Surprise!                                                                                    Alex: You can't come in now. Go away.                                                               Orion: What?! Why?                                                                                  Alex: Erm... I have guests.                                                                         Orion: Who?                                                                                         Alex: . . . Okay, I don't have guests, but you still can't come in.                                 Orion: Come on, you can't leave me here in this scary hallway! I feel like I’m in the beginning of a crime scene TV show, right before the murder is committed!                                         Alex: Just go back home.                                                                            Orion: It's raining outside!                                                                        Alex: *Serious tone* I said no. I'm serious. I appreciate your concern for me, and you can leave the meds, but I don't want you to catch my cold. Also... I prefer to be alone, honestly. So please.    Orion: Oh... Well, okay, I understand. I'll go back home and play from there, then. Are you sure    you'll be fine?                                                                                     Alex: Yes, I'll be fine.                                                                            Orion: Alright then, I won't bother you anymore.                                                    Alex: I'll see you and Dalia in Frontier Trails after you log in.                                   Orion: Sure thing! Take care, Alex. (Well, that's not the wholesome reaction I was expecting.       Although I can't do much more to change her mind. This is Alex we're talking about, after all.      Anyway, I should hurry up and get back home. I don't want to waste any more time than what I've     already wasted. And I don't wanna stick around in this creepy hallway for too long...)              Alex: I said no. I've got a cold, and I don't want... anyone to see me like this.                   Orion: I brought some meds and blankets for you. And even a tub of your favorite ice cream!         Alex: Go back home and I'll see you in Eternum. I'll be fine there.                                 Orion: But–                                                                                         Alex: I-I don't need anyone to take care of me! It's just a cold and I'm not 10 years old! ...though you can leave the ice cream at the door. NOW BYE!                                                  Orion: *Sighs* Okay... I guess I'll go back home. I'll leave the whole bag here, just in case you   need it later. Take care, Alex.                                                                     You walk down the hallway again and leave.                                                          Alex: . . . . . . You're still here, aren't you?                                                    Orion: Yes.                                                                                         Alex: You're a real pain, you know that?                                                            Orion: I get that a lot.                                                                            Alex: *Grumbling* Okay, okay... you can come in! But don't look at the apartment too much. I'm still unpacking and everything's pretty messy.                                                           Orion: Yay!                                                                                         Alex opens the door to let you in and locks the door immediately after.                             Orion: Hey, it looks nice inside! Quite a contrast with that dark hallway... you sure chose a scary place.                                                                                              Alex: I didn't really care about the building. And well, the... *Sneezes* Ah-choo! ...the r-rent was very cheap because of it.                                                                          Orion: *Turning around* Honestly, just the fact that you alone managed to... Oh my god. Okay,       sniffly Alex is now the most adorable thing I've ever seen.                                         Alex: S-Shut up. I'm constantly blowing my nose and sneezing, and my nose turned all red. My face   looks like a tomato.                                                                                Orion: Exactly! It's so cute.                                                                       Alex: Not cute. I look like a mess. Stop making fun of... Aaahh... *Sneezes* Ah-choo! ...me.        Orion: *Laughs* It wasn't my intention. (I've gotta say, this oversized shirt looks kind of hot.    It's actually hot seeing Alex like this, not gonna lie... Maybe because I'm not used to seeing her  so... “vulnerable”? I hope I don't develop a kink for sick girls now...) Are you sure it wouldn't be better if you just rested today? We can play tomorrow.                                             Alex: No way. We promised Nancy we'd find this Gem and we will. And Dalia is waiting for us! If you want, I'll take one of those pills of yours and I'll be as good as new by the time we... Aaahh...   *Sneezes* Ah-choo! Aaahh... *Sneezes* Ah-choo! *Nasal voice* ...log off.                            Orion: (God, I want to take care of her so bad. Please let me take care of you.)                    Alex: Anyway, let's get to work, shall we?                                                          Orion: You're not going to give me the grand tour of your new apartment first?                      Alex: Oh, but of course, of course! *Clears throat* Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my humble      abode... the newest mansion of the Bardot family! As we step through this majestic entrance, we are greeted by the sight of this warm and spacious hall. The unpacked boxes paint a picture of a space  adorned with comfort and style, and the completely empty walls add a touch of... *Sneezes* Ah-choo! ...elegance.                                                                                        Orion: *Laughs* Ah yes, I can see that.                                                             Alex: But let's not stop here! Much more grandeur awaits! Please, let's make our way into the heart of the home! I present to you, the room of living! Also called by many as... the living room!  Here you will find a quaint space designed for gathering with loved ones and entertaining guests, where  delicious home-cooked meals are shared and memories are made.                                       Orion: *Chuckles* I know you're being sarcastic, but this place is unironically awesome, Alex.      Alex: Really...?                                                                                    Orion: Really. Did you decorate it yourself?                                                        Alex: Well, kinda, I guess. I bought the table and the chairs on Craigslist, and the sofas and rugs at a flea market a couple of days ago. The frames on the walls, the coffee table, and the lamps were already here when I rented the place. I still have a few things to unpack.                         Orion: That's awesome. I admire how resourceful and tenacious you are.                              Alex: And then going that way, you can find a small kitchen, the bathroom, and another room.        Orion: Oh, can I see your bedroom?                                                                  Alex: Of course, make yourself at home. It's definitely the best part of the house.                 Orion: Oh, can't wait to see it!                                                                    Alex: Take a good look.                                                                             Orion: Ah, minimalist decor. I like it.                                                             Alex: Yeah, did you notice the soup can?                                                            Orion: Indeed, it adds an element of artistic intrigue while still avoiding any compromise to the   elegant composure of the space.                                                                     Alex: *Snorts* I'm glad to finally meet another expert in decoration. *Sneezes* Ah-choo! *Nasal     voice* Jeez, this cold is really beating me up... you mind if I grab one of those pills now?        Orion: Of course not, that's why I brought them. They're in the bag.                                Alex: Thank you. You can start putting your E-suit on, I'll do the same. We can play here in the    living room.                                                                                        Orion: Sure thing!                                                                                  You sit on the sofa and start putting on the E-suit while Alex goes to her room to do likewise.     Orion: (Should I mention I saw Axel earlier? Hmm... it's probably better to wait until later, I     don't wanna ruin the mood.)                                                                         Alex: *Talking from the other room* What the hell is all this?                                      Orion: What?                                                                                        Alex: This bag of yours. There are like, a thousand things in here.                                 Orion: Yeah, well, I didn't know what you had exactly, so I brought a bit of everything. Tylenol for fever reduction, ibuprofen, nasal spray, and a throat soother. Then I also got some cough drops for later, a few tissues, and a blanket. Ah, and don’t forget the ice cream! Put it in the freezer     before it melts.                                                                                    Alex: And what the fuck is this shit?                                                               Orion: What shit?                                                                                   Alex: There's like an ugly egg plush.                                                               Orion: OH! Dr. Eggdogstein!                                                                         Alex: I'm sorry?                                                                                    Orion: The lady who sold me the blanket told me it brings good fortune and helps to cure colds and  to heal wounds. I thought it could keep you company in your new apartment.                          Alex: *Snorts* Hmm.                                                                                 Orion: Do you like it?                                                                              Alex: I hate it. You definitely were scammed.                                                       Orion: Hmm, now that you mention it, the price of that blanket did seem a little steep, yeah...     Alex: Alright, I'm all set.                                                                         Orion: Sweet! Did you take any of the meds yet?                                                     Alex: Yeah, yeah, one pill and one of those lozenges.                                               Orion: Good choice! You should be as good as new by the time we finish our session.                 Alex: Let's not waste any more time, then. I already sent you an invite. Just go to the saloon after entering the server, Dalia should be waiting for us there. You can't miss it, don't worry. I've    been on this server a few times.                                                                    Orion: And you? Where's your E-visor?                                                               Alex: I'll go after you. I don't wanna start playing while you're still “awake”. Who knows what you could do to my precious apartment while I'm pretty much unconscious.                                Orion: Come on! Really? You know me already!                                                        Alex: I do, that's why I'm worried!                                                                 Orion: *Laughs* Fuck off. *Chuckles* Okay, okay, your house, your rules. See you on the other side! Connected. Welcome back to Eternum. You've received an invitation from... Alex. Would you like to   join her session?                                                                                   Orion: Yes!                                                                                         Please prepare to connect...                                                                        Orion: *Looking at your outfit* (Oh boy... Would you look at that!) *Giggles* (I've been looking    forward to this since Chang lent me Red Dead Redemption that one summer.) *Turning around* An       authentic Wild West server! And it is exactly as I had imagined! Arid cliffs! Rugged cowboys! Rowdy saloons! Lethal revolvers! Ravishing elves! Overflowing gold min– . . . W-What the hell?! C-Calypso? What are you doing here?!                                                                          Calypso: What do you mean? I thought we had already reached an agreement to collaborate together on the next mission. Have you forgotten?                                                               Orion: Well, yeah, I remember. It's just that I wasn't expecting you to show up so fast, or...      dressed up like that.                                                                               Calypso: Is there something wrong with my wardrobe?                                                 Orion: Nothing wrong per se, but...                                                                 Player: Hey! Have you seen my new horse? A purebred Missouri Fox Trotter, the fastest horse in      Frontier Trails!                                                                                    Orion: *Pulling Calypso around the corner* Shit, someone's coming.                                  Player: Eh?? This is not a Fox Trotter, it's a vulgar Morgan.                                       Player: What?! That fucking vendor told me it was the best horse in all of Eternum!                 Player: Please tell me you didn't pay any more than 40 eternals for this.                           Player: FUCK!                                                                                       Orion: Phew, that was close.                                                                        Calypso: You did not just grab me and handle me as if I were some lowly servant.                    Orion: What? Oh... I'm sorry, Princess. I was only trying to protect you. The enemy could be        anywhere so we should really stay on our toes. I apologize for the... sudden aggression. I had      assumed a mighty sorceress like yourself could handle it.                                           Calypso: Eh... a-and you were right on that note. I can endure anything thrown at me. But do not    worry so much about my integrity. An ordinary mortal could never stand up to me.                    Orion: Remember that the whole world is looking for you, though. If the Immortals discover you      escaped from your prison, they could come after you again.                                          Calypso: Hmm.                                                                                       Orion: In fantasy realms where elves and magic actually exist, you can blend in, but here you stand out like a fairy in a biker bar.                                                                    Calypso: I do suppose there is some sense to what you are saying. The people of these lands seem to lack any sense of elegance and refinement. That is undoubtedly obvious.                             Orion: Can you transform your outfit again, like what you did at the Ulysses dinner party?          Calypso: I have the ability to do so, yes.                                                          Orion: Do you see that girl over there? The one next to the black horse.                            Calypso: I do.                                                                                      Orion: Something like her outfit would be perfect.                                                  Calypso: Hmm...                                                                                     Orion: WOW! You nailed it. It looks exactly like hers. And it looks way better on you, I must say... (Good lord, Calypso has got one HELL of a bosom on her. Nancy and Penelope definitely have some    competition in that department...) Maybe a hat to hide your ears? Similar to the ones people are    wearing in this town.                                                                               Calypso: Like this?                                                                                 Orion: Perfect!                                                                                     Calypso: Ah, now I see why these simple folk are sporting such ridiculously large headpieces. It    provides very ample protection from the harsh desert sun. I rarely witnessed clear skies like this  back in Hyril'ar when I was growing up.                                                             Orion: Your realm? Is it often rainy?                                                               Calypso: It depends on the season. But it never gets as sunny as here, so we all share a pale       complexion. I can understand why you seem to find satisfaction in exploring other worlds and        integrating into their societies, Orion. It feels... invigorating.                                  Orion: *Chuckles* Right? You might be more of an explorer than what you had originally thought,     Princess. Now follow me, let's meet Dalia and Alex.                                                 Calypso: Yes... let us see what other peculiarities this world has to offer. *Reading the sign*     Saloon. Is this place like... an alehouse?                                                          Orion: Yeah, something like that. Although they have their own distinct charm.  Piano music,        swinging doors, poker, and lots of cowboys.                                                         Calypso: What is a cowboy?                                                                          Orion: *Climbing the stairs* Um... they're like... these horse riders who originally used to work   with cattle. Although most of them kind of evolved into bounty hunters after the lack of law        enforcement led to an increase in fugitives and crime in general.                                   Calypso: I see... Fascinating.                                                                      Orion: *Chuckles* (It feels endearing explaining basic concepts to Calypso. She might have many more decades under her belt, but there are certain aspects in which she seems to possess the innocence  and wonder of a child.)                                                                             You enter the saloon and a rustic and lively atmosphere welcomes you.                               Orion: Alright, this is the meeting point.                                                          Dalia: Orion! Over here!                                                                            Orion: There she is! *Sitting next to her* Good to see you! Wow, I love your hair. You look         absolutely stunning.                                                                                Dalia: *Giggles* Exaggerating as always. But thank you! I thought the braid would match the style of the server.                                                                                        Orion: It definitely does.                                                                          Dalia: Nice to have you here, Calypso! I didn't know you were gonna join us.                        Calypso: Yes, I decided to assist you in your quest to find these 10 special Gems. I am still deeply indebted to you for my liberation and this Princess always pays her dues. Furthermore, it may also unravel new leads that could allow me to return to my realm.                                        Dalia: Well, we'll be happy to have your help, that's for sure. I just hope no one discovers who you are because of how much you stand out.                                                             Orion: If she keeps her hat on there shouldn't be any problems.                                     Calypso: If my natural hair color is a problem I can temporarily modify it as well.                 Orion: There's no need. I just saw a girl with green hair on the way up here, so...                 Alex: Oh my, the gang’s all here and ready to go! Princess, Dalia, Orion.                           Orion: Ah, that face rings a bell.                                                                  Alex: *Sitting down* Does it?                                                                       Orion: *Chuckles* Yeah, although the last time I saw it, it was as red as a tomato. Are you feeling better now? Hey, good to see you, Alex!                                                             Alex: Hey, stranger.                                                                                Orion: Are you feeling better from your cold?                                                       Alex: Yeah, definitely. I wouldn't be able to show up here otherwise, I have a reputation to uphold.Orion: Is that so? Do you play here very often?                                                     Alex: You could say I know the server. I come here to play as a bounty hunter from time to time.    Criminals like to hide here, so it's not a surprise the man we're looking for had the same idea.    Dalia: I've never been to this one in particular, but I've played a few times in Tumbleweed, another Wild West server.                                                                                  Orion: Damn, how many Western servers are there?                                                    Dalia: These two used to be the main ones, but now Tumbleweed is practically abandoned. Most people just moved to Frontier Trails after a case of cannibalism in the other server. Some forums even talk about zombies.                                                                                     Orion: Damn, that sounds cool! We've gotta visit that one!                                          Saloon Bartender: Hello ladies and gents, welcome to the Blackridge Saloon! Mighty pleased to have  ya here! Have yourselves a grand ol' time, but please kindly refrain from pointin' them guns at the pianist. Now, what can I rustle up for ya?                                                          Orion: Hello!                                                                                       Coke                                                                                                Orion: We won't stay for long, but... I'll have a coke, thank you.                                  Coffee                                                                                              Orion: We won't stay for long, but... I'll have a coffee, thank you. With sugar.                    Tea                                                                                                 Orion: We won't stay for long, but... I'll have a cup of tea, thank you.                            Saloon Bartender: One whiskey, gotcha, comin' right up, partner!                                    Orion: Eh? But I asked for a–                                                                       Calypso: I will have a glass of water with a sprig of fresh mint, thank you.                        Saloon Bartender: Got it, another whiskey comin' up your way, ma'am. I'll get it poured for ya right quick!                                                                                             Alex: Um... yeah, I'll have a... whiskey, I guess.                                                  Saloon Bartender: Three whiskeys, got it! I'll have 'em ready for ya before you can say “yeehaw”!   And the last lady?                                                                                  Dalia: Yeah, um... what would you recommend, the buffalo ribeye or the T-bone?                      Saloon Bartender: Both options are mighty fine, ma'am. Best steak in the whole server!              Dalia: And the side dishes?                                                                         Saloon Bartender: You can pick creamy mashed potatoes or honey baked beans. The beans are my Ma’s   recipe, but either one will surely complement the steak just right!                                 Dalia: That's a tough choice... You know what? Bring me both entrees please, each one with a        different side dish.                                                                                Saloon Bartender: Four whiskeys, a ribeye with Mama’s beans, and a T-bone steak with potatoes.      They’ll be here in no time! I’ll be over yonder, but if you need anything else, just give ‘er a     holler!                                                                                             Dalia: Thank you!                                                                                   Orion: Why’d you order so much food? Isn't it... kinda pointless?                                   Dalia: Don't judge me!                                                                              Orion: *Chuckles* I’m not! Just curious.                                                            Dalia: Well, I do it because it tastes good, duh. I'll never have the chance to taste buffalo meat  in the real world!                                                                                  Orion: Fair point. I've been looking forward to eating one of those dragon burgers in Ekabar        myself...                                                                                           Dalia: And besides, I read a study that says eating in Eternum can trick your brain into thinking   that you've consumed more protein, so muscle growth is optimized!                                   Orion: *Chuckles* Definitely a win-win for you, then.                                               A girl sits on the last free chair left and stares at you in silence.                               Orion: Um... I'm sorry, we're in the middle of a private conversation. So if you don't mind...      ???: *Giggles* This is crazy. I've gotta say, you're looking good!                                  Orion: Erm... thank you? (Is this girl flirting with me?)                                           Alex: I'm sorry, do we know you?                                                                    ???: Orion does.                                                                                    Orion: What...? How do you know my name?                                                            ???: *Leaning forward and resting her breasts on the table* Awwwh, have you really forgotten about  me?                                                                                                 Orion: Is this some kind of scam on this server? I don't know what you're trying to get from us, but I haven't seen you before in my life.                                                              ???: That's mean. I guess our encounter wasn't as special for you as it was for me.                 Orion: What...?                                                                                     ???: Ion. You were playing Eternum for the first time, and I was rocking a hairstyle that was way   more... exotic? And more blue.                                                                      Orion: (Blue...?) OH SHIT. Eva??                                                                    Eva: Bingo! At least you remember my name.                                                          Orion: Wow, you look so different without the crazy pigtails and the whole neon look! How have you  been?                                                                                               Eva: You know... just running back and forth. I wasn't expecting to ever see you again, but... as I always say, Eternum has an odd way of bringing people back together again.                          Orion: Ain’t that the truth!                                                                        Calypso: So... who are you? Are you one of Orion's erstwhile lovers?                                Orion: W-What? O-Of course not! I was only around her for... like... for a few hours! Well... it was actually way less than that. We... Uhh... We're friends. I-I was on Ion, and... Erm... You know... Eh... I was kind of exploring the city, as uhh... adventurers do. And then I saw this neon sign... a crazy cool sign, you know?! Should’ve seen it! It had... glowing letters... and words, and...      uhh... *Nervous chuckle* W-Well, I vaguely remember it, t-to be honest. I went to... Damn, these    whiskeys sure are taking a while, aren't they? Did the bartender head out to harvest the barley     himself or something? Ha ha ha... Anyway... W-Where was I? Ah yes, I...                             Eva: There's no cool story behind it, really. Not much to write home about. I was a clerk in a newly opened bakery in Ion, and Orion came in to try one of our Nanobite Cupcakes. He was so nice and    treated me so well that I didn't even charge him for it.                                            Orion: Yes. T-That's pretty much what happened. Are you still working at the... bakery?             Eva: Nah. My boss fired me after she found out I let you go without paying. Turns out, giving away  free stuff when you're starting a new job is not the best idea. *Chuckles* I guess I should have    seen that coming. *Standing up* But anyway, I just wanted to say hi to Orion! Sorry for             interrupting, guys.                                                                                 Alex: You didn't, no worries.                                                                       Dalia: Yeah... no worries.                                                                          Orion: You sure you don't wanna stay for a bit?                                                     Eva: Nah, I've got things to do, but thanks!                                                        Orion: Well, catch you around then. It was good to see you.                                         Eva: Likewise! Until next time, Orion. Good to see you keeping such nice company...                 Orion: What can I say, I’m a very lucky man.                                                        Eva: *Giggles* Alright, bye guys!                                                                   Orion: *Turning around* Well... Where were we?                                                      Dalia: I didn't know you had so many friends.                                                       Orion: W-Who, Eva? I wouldn't even call her that. She's just an acquaintance.                       Dalia: Yeah... I heard the story. It sounded made up.                                               Orion: It wasn't! I just met her once, for real. I tried one of the... cupcakes there, and then I   left. Nice girl.                                                                                    Dalia: Mm-hm.                                                                                       Orion: *Clears throat* Shit, look at the time!                                                      Dalia: Are you done, Mr. Playboy?                                                                   Orion: Yeah, sorry about that. We should get to work!                                               Dalia: Yeah, we should.                                                                             Orion: Alright, let's get to work! What do we know about this Gem, Alex?                            Alex: *Leaning forward* Yes, that's a good idea. Let's do a little briefing. According to Nancy's   informants, the leader of a small group of bandits, named “El Coyote”, could be in possession of    another Gem of Doom. If we manage to get our hands on two Gems in such a short time, it'd be a huge hit for us.                                                                                         Orion: Hell yes! Let's get that bastard. What do we know about him?                                 Alex: We know he's called “El Coyote” and that he's probably hiding in this server.                 Orion: Mm-hm.                                                                                       Alex: . . . Um... that's all.                                                                       Orion: Oh.                                                                                          Alex: That is why we cannot waste a second. We should split up and look for clues about his hideout or his gang around the town.                                                                        Orion: Count on me!                                                                                 Alex: Alright, I'll go to the mines and see if anyone knows anything. Dalia, you go talk to the     Sheriff, near the station. See if we can get any info out of him.                                   Dalia: Consider it done!                                                                            Alex: Calypso, you can go talk to the Sheriff's deputy. I saw him behind this saloon just a minute  ago.                                                                                                Calypso: Engaging in conversation with the guardians of law and order of this realm should be       interesting.                                                                                        Alex: Orion, you talk to the bartender. He must have heard rumors from all over the town. Let's see if he can help us.                                                                                  Orion: Done.                                                                                        Alex: Alright, cool! We shouldn't delay this any further. Let's meet again here in a couple of      hours.                                                                                              Orion: Let's get this Gem, girls!                                                                   Dalia: Can you ask the bartender to save one of the steaks for later? Promise him I'll be back and  pay double.                                                                                         Orion: *Chuckles* Sure, I will.                                                                     Dalia: Thanks Orion! Good luck on the mission!                                                      Orion: Be careful out there!                                                                        Dalia: *Standing up* We will!                                                                       Orion: (Wow, they all look so hot. How am I supposed to concentrate on the Gems of Doom when I have these three cuties with me? Seeing them looking like that, I can't even believe that both Dalia and Alex have had their lips wrapped around my cock before. It almost feels unreal when I think about   it. Man, I'd kill to have another go with them someday... Seeing her looking like that, I can't even believe that Dalia has had her lips wrapped around my cock before. It almost feels unreal when I   think about it. Man, I'd kill to have another go with her someday... Seeing her looking like that, I can't even believe that Alex has had her lips wrapped around my cock before. It almost feels unreal when I think about it. Man, I'd kill to have another go with her someday... And Calypso...? I'd    fight a dragon just to see her naked. With her royal status and distinct beauty, I’m sure it’d be   unforgettable.)                                                                                     Alex: Okay, let's go then.                                                                          The three girls finish talking and leave the establishment.                                         Orion: (Jeez, I'm super turned on again. These few days away from them sure have taken a toll. And  what happened with Annie last night didn't help either, that's for sure...) *Slapping your cheeks*  (Okay, focus, Orion. Stop putting your skill points into “horny” and put them into “intelligence”   instead. Focus on the Gems. Focus on WINNING! I should probably ask the bartender to cancel the     whiskeys, though. I don't want to have to drink them all myself...)                                 You hear the saloon doors swing open as the piano abruptly stops playing.                           Orion: *Turning around* (Huh? Fuck, are those... Praetorians??) *Hiding your face under your hat*   (What the hell are they doing here?)                                                                Praetorian: Attention, players. All patrons of this establishment must immediately halt their       current activities and take heed of our proclamation. An illegal, stolen artifact has been detected within this server. Your cooperation is now mandated by the Ulysses EGCE commission to swiftly      recover the item. Time is of the essence.                                                           Saloon Bartender: Hold on there, partner... Do you think you can just saunter into my saloon and    start threatening my patrons just like that? GET THE F–                                             Praetorian: I’ll remind you that standing in the way of any Praetorian unit carrying out            command-directed orders will face permanent Excommunication. As previously stated, your cooperation is mandatory as this matter needs to be addressed immediately. Are there any others that wish to air their grievances? . . . The item of our attention is a palm-sized, cube-shaped artifact. One of our operatives will be stationed in the town center until this matter has concluded. Any assistance    provided in solving this case will be generously rewarded. Do any of you have questions? . . . Thank you for your cooperation.                                                                          The two Praetorians leave the saloon.                                                               Orion: (Holy fuck... Praetorians are on the server?? This is not good... And what are they looking  for? Calypso? No... that's impossible, the Founder knew she's with us. It wouldn't make sense for   him to send them. And... well, Calypso isn’t a “palm-sized, cube-shaped artifact”. What the hell is that about? I guess it'll be better if I just try to avoid them and go help the girls out there.    It's not as if I can interview the bartender anymore. A Wild West town, a hidden outlaw, and three  sexy girls. This promises to be fun. And possibly deadly.)                                          You survey the surroundings, and quickly spot Calypso sitting on one of the benches behind the      saloon.                                                                                             Orion: There she is! (Not the hardest girl to find. That hair of hers stands out like a lone        tumbleweed in the middle of the desert.) *Sitting next to her* Be careful, Princess. Those things   are deadly.                                                                                         Calypso: I find the workings of this device to be remarkably ingenious, I must say. Humans from my  realm who cannot wield magic are limited to longbows or crossbows. This seems to be much more...    precise. And fast.                                                                                  Orion: That’s nothing. You should see the things we have created in the present time. If there's one thing us humans are good at, it's killing each other.                                              Calypso: Hah, I must agree with you there. I have never seen any other race engaging in more        internal conflicts. Not even the dwarves.                                                           Orion: Where did you get it from, by the way?                                                       Calypso: I replicated the one the deputy was wielding.                                              Orion: Oh, so you found him already!                                                                Calypso: Indeed. He mentioned having business to attend to at the neighboring establishment, and he said he would answer my questions thereafter. I was waiting for him to come out.                    Orion: Nice! I see you quickly got the hang of things around here. You almost look like a local     already.                                                                                            Calypso: Hmm.                                                                                       Orion: You'd adapt to our world pretty fast, I'm sure.                                              Calypso: Of course. Humans are simple, and their intricacies, banal. Although... some of them pique my curiosity, I must admit.                                                                         Orion: Ah yeah, elven princesses do pique my curiosity as well. One particular elven princess, to be precise. *Chuckles* I even dreamt about you the other day.                                         Calypso: Oh, really? I very much hope there was no indecency in that dream.                         Orion: Not at all. (Unfortunately...)                                                               Calypso: In that case... I will allow it, despite its impropriety.                                  Orion: *Chuckles* Thank you for letting me dream, my Princess. Your generosity knows no limits.     Calypso: Well then, enlighten me. What occurred in this dream of yours, and what role did I play in it?                                                                                                 Orion: Well technically it wasn't a dream, more like a hallucination. We call it a “bleeding case”. It happened during a day I was alone at home and didn't have much to do. I think I fell asleep on   the couch or something, I don't remember it exactly. I saw the inn where you've been lodging in     Ekabar, and you were there with the innkeeper. He asked you to pay, and then you got all mad and    threatened him with your lightning magic. It was pretty funny.                                      Calypso: So... reminiscent of actual events?                                                        Orion: *Chuckles* Something similar happened? Did you have trouble with the innkeeper?              Calypso: Yes. He disrespected me, and I had to remind him who he was dealing with. Then you appeared out of nowhere, but left using vanishing magic without giving any sort of explanation.             Orion: What...? I don't have any vanishing magic. When did this happen?                             Calypso: Several moons ago.                                                                         Orion: (Several moons ago? Could I have fallen asleep wearing the E-suit and visor again? No, that  can't be. I was on my way to Luna's uncle's house. I didn't even have them with me. No, that can't  be. I remember I didn't play Eternum that day.) Nah, it's impossible. You must be mistaking it for  the time I went there with Alex.                                                                    Calypso: No... you were alone. You said–                                                            Orion: Shit, did those gunshots come from the store where the deputy is?                            Calypso: I believe so, yes...                                                                       Orion: Maybe he's in trouble?                                                                       Calypso: *Standing up* Perhaps with the man you're looking for?                                     Orion: El Coyote? Fuck, could be possible. Let's take a look.                                       You enter the store and find the Sheriff's deputy with his hands up.                                Orion: Um... is there a problem, sir?                                                               General Store Clerk: Oh, there is definitely a problem. This man is trying to rob me!               Sheriff's Deputy: I'm not robbing you, you dumbass! You've been renting this space for your store   for a while now and it’s about time you’ve paid your property taxes just like everyone else!        General Store Clerk: First, you steal our lands from us, and now you want us to pay YOU for         utilizing it?! Over my dead body! Do you know how long my ancestors have dwelled in this area?!     Sheriff's Deputy: Cut the shit, Brendan, you're from Queens!                                        General Store Clerk: You're offending my Wamapoke roots!                                            Sheriff's Deputy: That's not even a real tribe!                                                     General Store Clerk: Wallaho mahk-a-tokeh!                                                          Orion: Okay, hold your horses! The deputy is right, Brendan. And threatening a law enforcement      officer is a crime punishable by hanging. Let's not do anything stupid and settle this thing like   the gentlemen we are, shall we?                                                                     General Store Clerk: Hmmmm...                                                                       Orion: You’re gonna pay your taxes, but the deputy is going to be a kind-hearted soul and give you a couple more weeks to gather the money. Now do we have ourselves a deal?                            General Store Clerk: . . . And I want a 20% discount!                                               Sheriff's Deputy: What?!                                                                            General Store Clerk: 20%! Call it a reparations reduction! Otherwise I’ll start blastin’!           Sheriff's Deputy: Agh, okay, FINE! Just lower your gun already, would you?                          General Store Clerk: Ah, excellent deal, excellent! I can already feel the warmth of my ancestors   smiling down on us. It wasn't so hard, see?                                                         Sheriff's Deputy: *Sighs* Idiot... Thank you for your help, citizen.                                Orion: No problem, sir. And nice to meet you. My name is Orion.                                     Sheriff's Deputy: Tony Mack, I'm the Sheriff's right-hand man. How can I help you today?            Orion: We're looking for an outlaw called “El Coyote”. He's in possession of... an item we need.    Sheriff's Deputy: Ah... that bastard and his gang have been giving us problems ever since I arrived on this server. I know where he could be hiding.                                                    Orion: Wow, really?! That would be really helpful.                                                  Sheriff's Deputy: Come with me to the Sheriff's office. There's a map there somewhere... if we      manage to find it between all the whiskey bottles that man leaves around the place.                 Orion: Thank you very much!                                                                         Calypso: May I ask something?                                                                       Sheriff's Deputy: Sure thing, ma'am.                                                                Calypso: I saw a lot of cattle in the town, unprotected. Is there no risk of dragon attacks in this area?                                                                                               Orion: Um...                                                                                        Sheriff's Deputy: Ah, excellent question, ma'am.                                                    Orion: Is it...?                                                                                    Sheriff's Deputy: You must be new to Eternum. There are no dragons on this server. No magic or      fantasy elements either. I can give you a quick summary, if you want.                               Orion: (Oof, that was close.)                                                                       General Store Clerk: *Spinning his revolver* If you're worried about dragons, I sell a very powerful repellent, ma'am.                                                                                  Orion: Don't try to scam us, asshole. And put that thing down before you kill yourself.             General Store Clerk: Do you smoke? I sell the best tobacco in all of Blackridge too.                Orion: We don't want anything. And where did your accent go? Did you suddenly forget about your     Wamapoke roots?                                                                                     General Store Clerk: I'm a–                                                                         Orion: ARGH! Y-YOU SON OF A BITCH! I TOLD YOU! You could have hit someone! *Turning around* Oh      shit... OH SHIT. C-Calypso?! Are you okay?!                                                         Calypso: Eh...?                                                                                     Orion: *Sigh of relief* Oof, thank god.                                                             Calypso: What... happened...?                                                                       Orion: Um... t-there was an accident. This idiot fired his gun by mistake and he hit the deputy.    You'll have to use your magic to get rid of the mess. Oh... I guess you can only get rid of the     stuff on your clothes...                                                                            General Store Clerk: Wow, neat illusion!                                                            Orion: You better shut the fuck up!                                                                 Calypso: *Shivering* I-I am covered in the blood of a peasant. My pure and sacred skin is ruined... I HAVE... THE FLUIDS... OF A LOW-BORN PLEBEIAN... ON MY FACE.                                       General Store Clerk: Okay, okay, let’s just calm down. I know what to do, this isn’t my first rodeo. First of all, the Sheriff can't know about this, so let's keep our mouths shut, yeah? Secondl–     Calypso: . . .                                                                                      Orion: *Gulps* O-Okay, I remember seeing a hotel offering bath services above the saloon. I can take you there.                                                                                         Calypso: Yes. Please. I need to wash this filth off me immediately. Please help me.                 Orion: Don't worry, Princess, you'll be as good as new after this! I bet that bathroom is going to  look like heaven on earth! Follow me!                                                               Calypso: *Whining* W-What is this...? What sort of sorry excuse is this?!                           Orion: Um... their deluxe bath service, I guess.                                                    Calypso: Deluxe? How can they call this deluxe? Does this word have another meaning in your world?  Orion: Come on... it's not that bad.                                                                Calypso: Not that bad?? My pet unipony used to have a bigger pool than that. And much cleaner!      Orion: But it's still got what counts – hot water and soap! And... you hear that? You got yourself  some relaxing background music from the piano player in the saloon below! This place just keeps     getting better and better, if you ask me.                                                           Calypso: *Taking a deep breath* Okay... I can do it. I have endured worse challenges. But I need you to stay and protect me while I bathe.                                                              Orion: Huh...? You want me to stay... here? With you?                                               Calypso: I mean... y-yes, but do not allow your head to become filled with any strange or perverted ideas.                                                                                              Orion: No, no... not at all. I'm just honored. (Oh boy... am I gonna see Calypso naked?!)           Calypso: You must face the wall during the entire duration of my bathing. If you dare to turn       around, I will obliterate you as I did with the store owner.                                        Orion: Oh... (Goddammit.) Well... I guess I can wait right outside the door, if that’s the case.    Calypso: No, you need to be in here. This place is absolutely barbaric. In the short time I have    been in this town, I have seen FOUR people meet their death already.                                Orion: I'm pretty sure you could defend yourself from any possible danger without my help.          Calypso: Bathing is a sacred and cherished time for my people. It is not merely a physical activity, but a cherished ritual. We connect with the elements and purify our body and spirit as we step into the gentle embrace of the water. I cannot hear the melody of nature if I have to constantly worry  about possible assailants.                                                                          Orion: Um... I see.                                                                                 Stay and protect the Princess                                                                       Orion: Well, as you wish, my Princess.                                                              Leave                                                                                               Orion: But... as exciting as spending 20 minutes facing a wall sounds, I'd rather go help Alex or   Dalia.                                                                                              Calypso: *Grumbling* Hmph. Alright... I guess... you have a point. I don't need you. Go help Dalia  and Alexandra. I will meet you all again after I am done here.                                      Orion: Sounds good, see you then! Enjoy your bath, Princess.                                        Calypso: Hmm.                                                                                       Orion: I'll stay to protect you.                                                                    Calypso: Thank you.                                                                                 Orion: Can I at least look through the window instead of at the wall?                               Calypso: Hmm... I will allow it.                                                                    Orion: Thank you, Princess. Your generosity knows no bounds.                                        Calypso: *Getting her head out of the water* MMmmmmm...                                             Orion: Better? You sound very relaxed.                                                              Calypso: Mm-hm...                                                                                   Orion: I guess you owe this hotel an apology after all.                                             Calypso: *Soft chuckle* I guess I do. The temperature of the water was surprisingly perfect. And    this place carries good aromas, despite the sub-standard first impressions of the bathroom.         Orion: Well, I'm happy to hear that. Did you manage to clean off all the blood?                     Calypso: I did, thank you.                                                                          Orion: (Damn, she wasn't lying about bathing being a whole ritual for her. She spent like 10 minutes in silence, but now even her voice tone has changed. She sounds surprisingly warm.)                Calypso: How were the views?                                                                        Orion: *Looking out the window* Captivating. I counted 2 carriages and 9 horses. There's also this  damn Praetorian interrogating all the players that pass through this street. Quite a show. (I guess they haven't found the corpse yet.)                                                                 Calypso: *Looking at the other window* Do you think they could also be here looking for the Gem?    Orion: Nah, it's not that. It's them who started the whole Gems of Doom event in the first place.   Well... the Founder did. Idriel. Ulysses? I honestly don't even know how many sides there are in    this story anymore. In any case, we must gather the 10 Gems, that's all I'm sure of.                Calypso: *Reclining in the tub* Yes... just give me 5 more minutes and we can continue our search.  Orion: *Chuckles* You sure weren't lying about your love for bathing.                               Calypso: Of course. All our people love it, we cannot help it. They say it's an instinct inherited  from Anima.                                                                                         Orion: Anima?                                                                                       Calypso: You know, Queen Anima the Radiant.                                                         Orion: Never heard of her.                                                                          Calypso: What? Are you serious right now? You do not know of Lady Anima?                            Orion: Her name doesn’t ring a bell.                                                                Calypso: First Queen of the Sy-tel-quessir, Herald of the Elven Court, Guardian of the Forests,     Warden of the Eternal Soul?                                                                         Orion: Um... nope, sorry.                                                                           Calypso: Wow... even the silliest goblin of Hyril'ar has heard of Anima. As a child, I was          enthralled by the stories my mother shared about her.                                               Orion: Really? And what's her story?                                                                Calypso: She... well, she was our first queen. She started the elven dynasty and it is said she is  the source of our magic. You are probably not interested in the long version.                       Orion: I am interested. I want to learn more about you, your culture, and your past. Everything     about you and what surrounds you is... fascinating. And well, it's not as if I can do much else     right now except for looking through this window. That is... unless you allow me to turn around and get a glimpse of the princess's exquisite naked grace, of course...                                 Calypso: Oh Orion, how you humor me. Very well, I will grant your request. About the story. Now pay attention. We must go back beyond the annals of the Second Age, to an era veiled in the mists of    forgotten memory.                                                                                   Orion: (I was hoping my flirtatious charm would’ve had a greater effect.)                           Calypso: Now close your eyes.                                                                       Orion: Why?                                                                                         Calypso: That's how my mother used to tell me stories. Close your eyes and let the water embrace    you.                                                                                                Orion: *Closing your eyes* I'm not even bathing, but... alright.                                    Calypso: Try emptying your mind and imagining a land still blanketed in an aura of untamed          wilderness, with rising kingdoms sprinkled throughout.                                              Many centuries ago, the kingdom from which I belong needed no introduction to any man. Its prestige and beauty served as the foundation for many legendary tales told, whether from the cracked lips of the poorest farmhand or from the gluttonous mouth of the wealthiest lord. Its power swept far       throughout lush forests, majestic rivers, and many bustling cities to reach the furthest ends of the land. At the heart of this mighty realm stood a magnificent castle, and within it reigned a beloved king. This king had five boys, and the youngest of them was named Yliar. Legend has it that Yliar  was the only one of the five to be born during a full moon, which might have explained why he       strayed so far away from the graceful and gallant dispositions of his brothers. Despite the         differences, the king adored the reckless and impulsive Yliar and favored him amongst the others.   The young prince knew this, and often used the favor to his advantage... One fateful day, against   the orders set by his father the king, Yliar ventured deep into the enchanted forest on the         outskirts of the kingdom. While he navigated through the thick underbrush, he followed a rainbow of light from behind some distant trees and discovered a small, quaint clearing with a tranquil pond in the center. However, it was not the pond which caused such a stir... it was the beautiful, elven   woman who stood in the middle of it. Equipped with the royal education instilled in him since he was young, he knew of the powers the elven witches of the forest possessed, and soon the realization of incredible opportunity dawned upon him. Yliar soon uncovered the witch's exceedingly rare talent to connect alternate worlds, which presented him with the opportunity to amass immeasurable riches    across infinite realms. He promised her a life of pure joy and happiness beyond her wildest dreams, but in exchange... she needed to reciprocate by sharing her mystical abilities with him. As the     fantasies of a love-filled life flashed before her eyes, she cheerfully agreed and surrendered her  magic to him. But... little did the witch know... she had fallen deep into a twisted web of dark    deception. Yliar, suddenly invigorated with the newfound powers, grabbed the witch and restrained   her. He forced her to obey his wishes and surrender her free will, while remaining at his side like a pet. They returned to his family castle, and before the king could ask any question of his son,   the prince murdered him in cold blood... alongside his four older brothers. Yliar placed the seized crown upon his head and ascended to his new throne. With every life he extinguished, the young      prince only felt his thirst for power grow deeper and deeper. The people of Hyril’ar, without any   protector and feeling so dearly helpless, had no choice but to bend the knee to their new king. They lived in awe and fear of their new ruler, while Yliar relished in the realization that now no one  stood in his way. He thought himself to finally be invincible. Nevertheless, one day, a mysterious  man arrived at the grand entrance of Yliar’s castle and demanded an audience with the king. Yliar,  seeking to quickly get rid of this sudden annoyance, entertained the stranger’s request. To his     astonishment, the unknown man questioned the legitimacy of Yliar’s rule in front of the whole court and challenged the king to a duel. Amused at the audacity of this man, the king scoffed and decided to accept the man’s challenge, completely confident in his supremacy. As Yliar well knew, the       Hyril’ar Seers had foretold years ago that only a person holding royal blood within their veins     would be capable of harming the unrivaled king. This prophecy, however, was dismissed by the masses and the king himself, as all those with royal blood had perished at the hands of the man currently  holding the throne... The challenge of combat quickly began in the Royal Courtyard, as the audience watched with bewilderment. Yliar, eager to make an example of this man, conjured the powers he      drained from the elven witch and struck the challenger. However, much to the king’s disbelief, the  mysterious visitor absorbed the magic and channeled it back onto Yliar, striking him suddenly and   causing him to fall back onto the floor. The entire court gasped, having never seen another human   wielding magic before, and watched in amazement as Yliar had finally met a worthy opponent... And   eventually... his own defeat. The victorious man proved to be a stark contrast to the befallen      ruler, and he was quickly proclaimed by the masses as their new king. In a twist of fate, the man   took the defeated king’s former captive and married her, promising the witch to always safeguard her ultimate yearning in life... her freedom. Now known as Anima the Radiant, the witch who was        suddenly elevated from captive to royalty finally found herself at last in the life she had         fantasized about before... One of unrelenting love and boundless happiness beyond her wildest       dreams. Together, the two rulers ushered in a new era for the realm and established the noble       dynasty of the Sy-tel-quessir. A lineage that endures to this very day, with each of its members    serving as stewards of justice, harmony, and compassion throughout all the lands of Hyril’ar.       Orion: Wait, wait, wait... let me recap. This witch and the mysterious man... are they supposed to  be your ancestors?                                                                                  Calypso: They are.                                                                                  Orion: So your forefather was... human?!                                                            Calypso: O-Okay, I see where you are heading with this. First and foremost, Queen Anima's spouse was an Eldari. They look like humans, but they are a distinct race. Not only do Eldari possess an      extended lifespan, spanning centuries, but they also possess magical prowess comparable to that of  pure-blooded elves. And secondly, Anima's lineage was so exceptionally unadulterated that all her   descendants were unequivocally regarded as pure elves too.                                          Orion: I don't know... to me it sounds like your ancestor shared your same fascination for the human race.                                                                                              Calypso: I said he was not human! And... I-I am not fascinated by anything.                         Orion: *Chuckles* Okay, okay, I'll take your word for it. Seriously though, that was a great story. Your culture and history is completely captivating, it sounds like a fairy tale. When did this      happen?                                                                                             Calypso: Tens of thousands of years ago. Queen Anima reigned over Hyril'ar for a millennia. She     built the Elven Grand Library, reclaimed the Lost Territories, and expanded the borders of the      Alliance to unsuspected limits.                                                                     Orion: And what about her husband? How did he manage to defeat Yliar despite the prophecy? Did he   actually have royal blood?                                                                          Calypso: He died long before Queen Anima, so we do not know so much about his life. And the         information about him differs depending on who tells the story. Some say he was a lost brother, some say he was Yliar's bastard son, and others say he was a royal from another realm.                  Orion: Another realm? Could many people travel to other worlds creating portals like you do?        Calypso: Only Anima could. That is why she was even considered a deity in some regions. I was the   first and only descendant of Anima who inherited this ability.                                      Orion: Wow... that's incredible. I'm glad to have a goddess on our side.                            Calypso: *Snorts* I am no goddess. My abilities pale in comparison to what Queen Anima could do.    Orion: Still, I'm glad to have you with us.                                                         Calypso: Well, let us not forget that I still owe you my life. I will not consider myself absolved  of this debt until I have repaid the favor in kind.                                                 Orion: Come on, you've helped us a lot already.                                                     Calypso: It's still not comparable to setting me free from my confinement.                          Orion: But I don't want you to feel obliged to help us. I’m not trying to be like the evil king in  your story, dragging you along as his pet or something.                                             Calypso: I am committed to cooperate with you in any way necessary until you deem that the debt has been sufficiently settled, as it is a matter of my personal integrity and honor.                    Orion: Hmm... (Should I try to tease her again? Since she’s in a better mood after that bath, maybe she’ll be more playful to my “charm”. And... the situation calls for it, to be honest.)             Tease her                                                                                           Orion: Well, if you insist... let's do something.                                                   Let it go                                                                                           Orion: (I've probably risked enough for today.) Well, in that case, we should go help Alex and      Dalia. The Gem is still out there somewhere.                                                        Calypso: Indeed. You should go. I will stay here for a few more minutes.                            Orion: Are you sure?                                                                                Calypso: Certainly. I appreciate your assistance, though. I will meet you all again after I am done.Orion: Alright then. Enjoy the rest of your time in humankind's eighth wonder of the world – the    most prestigious and opulent bath house to ever exist!                                              Calypso: *Soft chuckle* Thank you, I will.                                                          Orion: (Hey, I got a chuckle! Keep grinding, Orion...) If you allow me to finally turn around right now and catch a glimpse of the princess's flawless form... I'll free you from your... “debt”.       Calypso: *Sitting up* Are you aware that just making such a proposition could result in a ruling of death within the Hyril'ar Court?                                                                    Orion: Hey, no risk, no reward. I like to live dangerously. All I wish is to see what lies beneath  the Princess’ royal attire... to see you in all of your magnificent splendor. Is it too much for    this devoted servant to ask of?                                                                     Calypso: Indeed, it is. You are lucky I have not vaporized you yet.                                 Orion: *Speaking dramatically* Bards have crafted songs about your unparalleled beauty. And I am but a mortal enthralled by your grace. *Speaking dramatically* Can you blame these lowly eyes for      wanting to gaze upon that which is heavenly?                                                        Calypso lets out a soft, yet playful chuckle.                                                       Calypso: Your eloquent words will not change anything. And you have never heard any of those songs  you speak of.                                                                                       Orion: But they do exist, then!                                                                     Calypso: Hmm... Well... perhaps a few. But that is irrelevant. No human has ever laid eyes upon my  naked body, and I do not plan to change that today. They are not even permitted within the castle!  All my maids are of pure elven lineage.                                                             Orion: That's exactly the point! If it wasn't such a rare privilege, it wouldn't be worth absolving you from your debt.                                                                                 Calypso: My maids always warned me that human males were lustful and insatiable barbarians. It seems they were not mistaken after all.                                                                  Orion: Lustful and insatiable, perhaps, but also with a heart of gold!                              Calypso: *Soft chuckle* Yes, I suppose so.                                                          Orion: Ah, I got another chuckle from the Princess herself! I'm on a roll.                          Calypso: You have always treated me with respect, I must acknowledge that.                          Orion: I'd never do something that could compromise your integrity or honor. You know it, Calypso.  In all seriousness now, I like to think that we're helping each other to achieve our respective     goals. We're a team.                                                                                Calypso: Hmm. Yes. I like that vision too. Mmm...                                                   Orion: Anyway, I should really get going now. We're running out of time and that Coyote dude could  be planning to grab his things and escape to another server.                                        You hear Calypso coming out of the water behind you.                                                Calypso: Very well, Mr. Insatiable Barbarian with a heart of gold...                                Orion: Yeah...?                                                                                     Calypso: . . . I do not have all day.                                                               Orion: D-Does this mean what I think it means?                                                      Calypso: You are forbidden from ever disclosing this incident to anyone else, do you understand?    Orion: A-aha.                                                                                       Calypso: If you accept that precondition, then yes... you may turn around.                          Orion: Oh sweet lord... (Look at that body... My god, her breasts are absolutely perfect, just as I imagined.) I can't believe I'm seeing this.                                                         Calypso: *Sitting on the corner of the tub* Yes... I cannot believe I am letting you see it either. Maybe all this time spent among commoners is muddying my temperament.                               Orion: Ah... you ended up becoming fond of me, didn't you?                                          Calypso: I ended up taking pity on you, more like. This is what you were yearning for, so... I      suppose I can grant you that wish.                                                                  Orion: And it's even better than I imagined... I officially release you from your debts.            Calypso: Remember, you must keep your mouth shut. If word gets out that I revealed myself to my     human squire, it would ruin my reputation... for a few decades at least.                            Orion: My lips are sealed, my Princess.                                                             Calypso: They better be. I am committing quite a sacrilege here. My old Tutor of Elegance and Virtue would be horrified if she discovered I'm doing this.                                               Orion: God, everything you say excites me more... Don't you feel the same?                          Calypso: Hmph. What I feel is... contradiction. Many Lords in Hyril'ar would surrender all their    possessions just to see what you are seeing right now, you know? And here I am... showing myself in my purest form to a mere mortal.                                                                    Orion: (She keeps insisting on that, but her subtle smirk tells a different story. I can tell she's taking pleasure in breaking her royal protocols...) Don't worry, it'll be our secret. And besides, I didn't even touch you, so... no purity or virtue was lost. Unless...                               Calypso: Hah, you better not continue that sentence. *Standing up* No human has ever touched me, and none ever will. That is a line I will never cross.                                                 Orion: What if it's you who touches me instead...?                                                  Calypso: Same thing applies.                                                                        Orion: I see... that's too bad. I'll use the few seconds I have left to admire your beauty a bit    more, then.                                                                                         Calypso: Hmm.                                                                                       Orion: (Jesus, she really has a spectacular body. Is it bad that I want to grab the Princess and    completely destroy her against that rotten cabinet? Might as well make even more of a mess in       here... My god, my pants are about to explode.)                                                     Calypso: Well, now it is your turn to get undressed.                                                Orion: I'm sorry?                                                                                   Calypso: What do you mistake me for, some kind of common harlot who gets naked without              reciprocation? Nonsense! You need to undress for me as well.                                        Orion: I thought you were granting my wish.                                                         Calypso: And I still am. You are forgetting who you are dealing with, Orion. I am an heir to the    Hyril’ar Realm and there are different protocols with me.                                           Orion: That's a fair point, I guess. (She really wants to keep a high profile all the time, eh? To  keep her superior social status in check. Alright, I can play her game. I've never been one to feel ashamed of my physique, and now that I look even more muscular, it only strengthens my confidence.) Very well. Your wish is my command, my Princess.                                                    You slowly begin to undress while Calypso gazes at you.                                             Orion: (Dammit... I thought that if I took my time undressing, my erection would go away. This might be awkward...)                                                                                     Calypso: . . .                                                                                      Orion: *Finishing undressing* Well... it's done. Equal conditions.                                  Calypso: Holy Mother of Turska... what is that??                                                    Orion: Um... Yeah... s-sorry about that. I know erections are probably... out of protocol. I        couldn't help it.                                                                                   Calypso: I mean... You are ... better-endowed than what I imagined. Are you... half-orc, perhaps?   Orion: Um... nope, only human.                                                                      Calypso: Are you sure?                                                                              Orion: Yeah, pretty sure. No orcs in my family that I know of.                                      Calypso: I see...                                                                                   Orion: (God, her short glances to my cock are turning me on so much...) You seem quite enthralled by my naked body, Princess. Isn't your gaze upon my intimate areas also a breach of protocol?         Calypso: P-Please, I am not e-enthralled by anything. Although... I will admit that the whole       situation is certainly out of protocol, yes.                                                        Orion: You can look at it. I don't mind, really.                                                    Calypso: I have looked at it enough. I was just surprised because... it doesn't match your skinny   physique, that is all.                                                                              Orion: Hey, I'm not skinny!                                                                         Calypso: Please... Hyril'ar elite guards probably weigh twice as much as you. That is a strong male.Orion: But muscles don't always equal strength. I'm likely stronger than them.                      Calypso: I highly doubt it. General Arannis once carried me all the way back to the castle from the Eldermoor Huntlands when my horse ran away.                                                         Orion: I don't know how far that is to the castle, but I'm sure I could do that too.                Calypso: *Huffing* If you say so... I will keep it in mind if we ever find ourselves in a similar   situation.                                                                                          Orion: I'd be happy to show you how strong and vigorous I can be...                                 Calypso: You know, I decided to tolerate your indecent innuendos given the situation we are in since they're almost... endearing. But I must warn you, they are about as futile as a dwarf's attempt to outrun an elven archer. No human will ever touch me. Not now, not ever.                             Orion: But I touched you already. Several times.                                                    Calypso: Hmph. Fair, I guess. No human will ever touch me below my shoulders, since you prefer to   nitpick.                                                                                            Orion: I gotta say, today has made me regret being human like never before.                         Calypso: I will not blame you for the shortcomings of your race. And neither should you. Even if we set aside the stark contrast in our social classes, a human would never be able to endure an elven  woman. It is just how it is.                                                                        Orion: *Chuckles* Okay, now you're clearly underestimating me.                                      Calypso: Please...                                                                                  Orion: Oh, is that a challenge...?                                                                  Calypso: *Soft chuckle* If we were in Hyril'ar, I might even consider allowing you to test yourself with one of my maids. Some of them would surely agree purely out of a morbid fascination with the   idea.                                                                                               Orion: That sounds incredibly hot, but... I could definitely “endure” even an elven princess.       Calypso: Please, spare yourself the embarrassment. You would be finished before even starting.      Orion: Hah! Who do you take me for? That's not true!                                                Calypso: If I wanted to, I could make you finish without touching you.                              Orion: Not true.                                                                                    Calypso: In less than a minute.                                                                     Orion: Not true.                                                                                    Calypso: . . . . . .                                                                                An intense tingling runs through your body.                                                         Orion: O-O-Ohh... shit, w-what was that?                                                            A strong force pulls you down into the floor.                                                       Orion: W-What's going on?! What the fuck...                                                         Calypso: You do not seem to fully understand here, Orion, and now I am starting to take it as a     personal affront.                                                                                   Orion: O-Oh boy...                                                                                  Calypso: So let me stoop to your level here. I could make you ejaculate without touching your dirty, inferior human body. That is how superior the elven race is. Was I clear enough now?               Orion: I'm sorry, but you're wrong, my Princess...                                                  Calypso: *Playful chuckle* We will see about that...                                                The surprisingly warm ghostly hand grabs your shaft firmly.                                         Orion: O-Oh shit...! O-O-Ohhh my god... W-What the hell is this...?!                                Calypso: *Giggles* Elven magic.                                                                     Orion: Ahhh... fuck, your mages sure know the best spells... (What in the world?! This doesn't feel like a normal handjob... It doesn't even feel like a hand. It feels as if my whole cock was embraced by something... warm... and incredibly tight... Fuck, she's squeezing it so hard that she'll make  it explode...)                                                                                      Calypso: All well down there, Orion? You seem to be struggling.                                     Orion: P-Pretty well, yes. I've never been... aaahhh... b-better. (Fuck, I'm gonna cum... FUCK, am I gonna cum already?! No, no, no, I can't give her that satisfaction...) Aaaahhh... holy fuck...     (Okay... yeah... That's it... you can hold it, Orion... You can do it. Think of ugly things...      Nooo... don't look at her, that makes it worse... Don't look at Calypso's perfectly shaped body...  her hourglass curves... don't look at her mesmerizing tits... Fuck... Hold on there, Orion... Focus on what she’s gonna do next after she gets frustrated that she can’t make you cum without touching  you... Y-Yeah, that's it... Her superior status will crumble... Maybe then she’ll want to try       harder... And she’ll probably get closer... Oh boy, imagine burying my cock deep inside the         Princess' pure depths... Just imagine... Seeing her eyes rolled up with pleasure... BEGGING me for  more... And me cumming all over her pretty face...) *Muttering* Yeah... you like having fluids of a plebeian on your face now, don't you, Princess...? What a filthy girl...                            Calypso: What?                                                                                      Orion: E-Eh...? N-Nothing! Nothing! I just... ahhh... Nothing...                                    Calypso: Your tenacity is admirable, I must acknowledge that.                                       Calypso boosts her speed, increasing the pressure and warmth of her magic hand even more.           Orion: AAAaahh... (Goodness gracious, I can't even move. It feels as if my whole body was           paralyzed.)                                                                                         Calypso: I am surprised by your... endurance.                                                       Orion: T-Thanks. (If she can really make me feel this way without touching me... How would her      actual hand feel? Or her mouth... Her pussy...) AAaahh... (I wanna sully the Princess so much... I  wanna corrupt her...) Aaahh... L-Looks like you won't be able to make me “finish” after all,        Princess...                                                                                         Calypso: *Clenching her fist even harder* You are restraining yourself.                             Orion: *Gritting your teeth* W-W-Well, that's the p-point.                                          Calypso: Do you think you can overpower me? You will see now...                                     Another magic hand appears.                                                                         Orion: Oh boy... AAAaaaaaugghh...                                                                   As Calypso launches her final assault, a torrent of sensations unlike anything you have ever known  engulfs you.                                                                                        Calypso: *Clenching her fists* This has gone on for long enough!                                    Orion: Oh FUCK. T-This is too much...                                                               Calypso: Hmmmhhgg... *Grumbling* Release yourself for your Princess! That is an order!              Orion: (Oh shit, she sounded so angry, but it was so hot at the same time...)                       With every stroke of the hand, the sensation intensifies, firmly anchoring you to the earth beneath, immobilizing you with overwhelming force.                                                          Calypso: *Grumbling* Why is he not finishing?!                                                      Orion: O-O-Ohh my god... Hhnnnggg... Oh god... (At this rate my balls are gonna explode. But I did  it! I'm not cumming! I won. I... Huh...?) She stopped...? Eh...? C-Calypso?                         Calypso: . . .                                                                                      Calypso touches your cock with the tip of her finger.                                               Orion: FFFFFFFFFFFUUUCKKKKK.... AAAAAaaaAARgggGGHhh... AAAaaaahhHhh... *Collapsing to the ground*   H-Holy Jeebus Harry and Broseph... *Catching your breath* God... *Catching your breath* Okay...     y-you win... *Catching your breath* Unbelievable... (She made me cum with a single finger... Who the hell is this woman...)                                                                             Calypso: Well... congratulations. You forced me to... touch you... directly. Your mental fortitude  has demonstrated a resilience befitting an elf. In the end, it cannot be denied that you possess... a remarkable spirit. Maybe you really are special after all.                                        Orion: *Standing up* Wow, that was... s-something. I tried my best to prove you wrong, but... y-you really have a formidable magical prowess, Princess.                                                 Calypso: Do not blame yourself. Your capabilities are constrained by the inherent limitations of    your lineage. Human lustfulness will always be a hindrance for your race.                           Orion: Are you telling me elves never get... horny?                                                 Calypso: I did not say that. We just... learned to control it better. The human lifespan is short.  That is why your instincts compel you to... copulate at any available opportunity. To propagate your progeny. We, as immortal beings, learned to transcend such primal urges a long time ago.           Orion: I don't know... your cheeks look even more flushed than before. And I'm not sure it's because of the hot water anymore...                                                                        Calypso: I can assure you it is the reaction to the warm water. Additionally, channeling magic      requires intense physical and mental effort. So... be that as it may, my blush is not caused by     arousal, you can be certain.                                                                        Orion: Of course... (I kinda feel the Princess is lying... she never gets this flushed after        conjuring all those portals...) Well... in any case, I guess we should go find Alex and Dalia. We   still need to find that Gem. As long as you still want to help us, that is. You're free now. You    don't owe me anything anymore.                                                                      Calypso: I will continue helping you... of my own volition. You are still the best chance I have to find my way back to Hyril'ar. But you go ahead, I will join you all after I am done. After such an  activity, I need to bathe again and cleanse myself. You will agree that this situation spiraled out of control.                                                                                         Orion: Of course. I'll leave you alone, Princess. Will you allow me one last compliment before I    leave?                                                                                              Calypso: I will.                                                                                    Orion: You truly are a beacon of beauty. I'll have your image burned into my memories for a long    time. I can't speak for Queen Anima's appearance, but... she surely could not have had such         magnificent attributes.                                                                             Calypso: Hmm. That was... terribly sacrilegious. But... I will allow it.                            Orion: (That's not the reaction I would have gotten a few weeks ago. She’s warming up to me, I can  feel it. Keep grinding, Orion...)                                                                   Calypso: Were you not leaving?                                                                      Orion: O-Of course! Take care, my Princess.                                                         Calypso: Until we meet again, Orion.                                                                Orion: (Damn, the sun really is merciless here. That train has to feel like an oven. Somehow I doubt it has air conditioning.)                                                                          Dalia: Agh, you're such an incompetent motherfucker!                                                Orion: (Ah, I know that voice.) *Turning around the corner* (And I know that ass too.) Hey Dalia!   Dalia: *Turning around* Hmm? Oh, hi Orion.                                                          Orion: What are you up to? Do you need any help?                                                    Dalia: Well... maybe. I was trying to talk to the Sheriff of the town, but he turned out to be an   incompetent drunk.                                                                                  Sheriff: *Hic* I heard ya, ya know?                                                                 Dalia: Bite my ass.                                                                                 Sheriff: Agh... these kids have no respec' anymore...                                               Dalia: *Sighs* So yeah, he doesn't want to tell me anything about El Coyote, even if he does know   something. He wants us to pay him.                                                                  Orion: Hmm... let me talk to him. Maybe I can convince him with my persuasive techniques.           Dalia: Sure, suit yourself.                                                                         Orion: Good morning, sir.                                                                           Sheriff: *Hic* Marthaaa?? I mm’told ya I don’t know anything about those crusty socks...            Orion: Um... what?                                                                                  Sheriff: Ehh? Wait... you're not... you're not Martha. What do ya want now, boy... make it shhnappy.Orion: (Yikes, his breath stinks of alcohol.) Are you seriously the Sheriff...?                     Sheriff: *Hic* What, those eyeballs just for show or shh-omethin’?? Lookey here at my shiny precious and read, boy.  Sherrrr...ifffffff.                                                                Orion: Yeah... I see it. They clearly chose the best man possible for the job.                      Sheriff: *Hic* Oh, that’s actually very sh-weet of ya. Thank you!                                   Orion: Anyway... We were looking for a dangerous criminal that might be hiding in your town. He goes by the name of “El Coyote”.                                                                        Sheriff: Mmm... why yesh, yesh, I know where one of his folks is hidin’. Coyote himself might be    there too!                                                                                          Orion: Oh, excellent! Where is he?                                                                  Sheriff: *Hic* Bet you’d love to know, wouldn’tcha? Throw 150 eternals my way and I'll tell ya.     Orion: What?! But you're the sheriff! Shouldn't you be the one paying us to catch a criminal?       Sheriff: *Hic* Look, boy... they say crime doesn’t pay but what they don’t tell ya ish that THE LAW DON’T EITHER! This whiskey ain’t gonna refill itself, y’know?? So... 150 of the big-bucks, or El    Coyote and his folks are gonna keep winnin’ this game of hide and seek with ya.                     Orion: You've gotta be the worst sheriff ever.                                                      Sheriff: Yeah, I get that a lot.                                                                    Orion: Jeez, this guy is a piece of work.                                                           Dalia: No wonder outlaws can hide in this server without worrying.                                  Orion: *Sighs* I guess we'll have to bribe him. It's too good of a lead to let it go.               Dalia: Yeah, I guess. You wanna play for it? The loser has to cough up the cash.                    Orion: *Chuckles* Ah, there's the Dalia I know... Always up for a chance to compete, huh? Alright,  I'm in.                                                                                             Dalia: Let's go for a classic game of rock-paper-scissors. The loser pays the bill.                 Orion: Rock-paper-scissors? Are you sure? Don't you prefer a game that relies less on luck?         Dalia: Luck? There's no luck involved here, Orion. Rock-paper-scissors is a game of mental agility, where deciphering your opponent's intentions is the essence of the game. It's a battle of wits, my  friend.                                                                                             Orion: *Laughs* If you say so. Alright, rock-paper-scissors it is, then. Best of three?             Dalia: One round. All or nothing.                                                                   Orion: Fine with me.                                                                                Dalia: Okay, you ready?                                                                             Orion: On the count of three. One... Two...                                                         Rock                                                                                                Dalia: Three! Oh.                                                                                   Orion: A tie.                                                                                       Dalia: Again?                                                                                       Orion: Again.                                                                                       Dalia: Three! Three!                                                                                Paper                                                                                               Dalia: Three! Three! Oh.                                                                            Orion: A tie.                                                                                       Dalia: Again?                                                                                       Orion: Again.                                                                                       Dalia: Three!

Orion: A tie.                                                                                       Dalia: Again?                                                                                       Orion: Again.                                                                                       Dalia: . . . Dammit.                                                                                Orion: Sorry, Dalia. It's a battle of wits. You never stood a chance.                               Dalia: One day, I'll have a bit of luck on my side. Just a tiny bit... But anyway, fair is fair. I  pay.                                                                                                Orion: Handling the loss like a true sportswoman, Miss Carter. . . . Dammit.                        Dalia: Flawless victory! I told you, Orion. A battle of wits. You never stood a chance.             Orion: *Chuckles* I still think it's all pure luck, but anyway, fair is fair. I lose, I pay. Now    let's talk to this drunkard... Okay... here's your money. 150 eternals. The information better be   worth it.                                                                                           Sheriff: Ah, sweet, sweet! Thank you so much, kiddo. With this I'll be able to buy us some new      fancy-gizmos for the office. And maybe... a couple of bottles of whiskey to celebrate it. Two or    three. Or... four. Life’s long... gotta have enough to last. *Hic* Perhaps five. Life is short!     Drink while you can...                                                                              Orion: The info!                                                                                    Sheriff: Okay, okay! Why such a hurry? Jeez... *Hic* Lemme remember... El Coyote had this big man in his gang... Boone! Strong guy. Nice fella. He looooved to fish! Like, really, really loved it!     So... one day, he found this old cabin near a pond, and bam! He decided to camp there all the damn  time! If he's in Eternum, you'll prolly find him there fishin' away.                                Orion: And El Coyote could be with him?                                                             Sheriff: *Hic* Seems likely. Good hidin' spot, that's for sure. You gotta ride your horsie through  the Red Ridge, ya know, for like... solid two whole hours.                                          Dalia: WHAT? Two hours on horseback?!                                                               Sheriff: Yeap, that's what I said.                                                                  Orion: Well, we should be on our way, then.                                                         Sheriff: You're welcome!                                                                            Orion: I didn't say thank you.                                                                      Sheriff: Oh, if you... *hic* see my deputy, could you tell him to bring me some tobacco from the    General Store? He went there to collect some taxes or somethin'.                                    Orion: Um... the deputy...? S-Sure. I-I haven't seen him, but I'll keep it in mind. *Clears throat* Farewell, Sheriff. Pay me 150 eternals and I'll tell him.                                           Sheriff: . . . Well played.                                                                         Orion: Well... that's quite a ride, that's for sure.                                                Dalia: Yeah, it is... I'll go get a horse and be on my way.                                         Orion: Alright, let's go.                                                                           Dalia: I'll go alone, don't worry.                                                                  Orion: Nah, you won't. I wanna go with you.                                                         Dalia: Seriously, don't worry.                                                                      Orion: Come on, two hours riding alone has to be boring. It'll be more fun if we go together. I     wanna do this with you.                                                                             Dalia: Well... if you insist... o-okay! Well... if you insist, okay. Just don't complain about it   later. I'll go round up a couple of horses. This is a long trip, so... maybe you should go see if   Alex and Calypso need any help before we leave.                                                     Orion: I already checked on them. We should be good to go.                                          Dalia: Alright, cool! Meet me at the chapel in the southern part of town in 5 minutes, then.        Orion: Sure, I'll go get some water for the trip in the meantime. Sure, that sounds good.           Dalia: Meet me at the chapel in the southern part of town after you're done.                        Orion: I'll be there! I'll bring some water for the trip too.                                       Dalia: Sounds good. See you now! *Patting the horse* Good girl! If you behave I'll give you a bucket of carrots when we're back, deal?                                                                  Orion: I see you could find a horse!                                                                Dalia: Hey! Yeah, I did. And it's a good one, should be able to maintain a good pace for several    miles, even in this heat.                                                                           Orion: Sweet. Does she have a name?                                                                 Dalia: I call her Roach.                                                                            Orion: *Chuckles* Good name. What's my horse's name?                                                Dalia: Actually... I could only find one. She was the only horse left at the stables.               Orion: Oh.                                                                                          Dalia: So... I guess I'll have to go alone, after all. Which might be better, honestly. We're not   even sure if El Coyote will be hiding in this cabin, so we'll cover more terrain if we split up. I'm not sure I can put up with you for two whole hours.                                                Go with her                                                                                         Orion: Can't we ride together?                                                                      Dalia: Um... it's probably not a good idea, we'd go way slower. And I don't wanna strain Roach too  much. Seriously, don't worry about it. I can handle it.                                             Stay in the town                                                                                    Orion: Awh, that's too bad. I can go instead of you, if you want.                                   Dalia: Nah, it's okay, but thanks for offering. It'll be a good chance to improve my horse riding   skills.                                                                                             Orion: Yeah, that's a... useful skill to learn, for sure. Okay then, be careful out there!          Dalia: Hopefully I'll be back in a few hours... but if I'm not, text me when you log off!           Orion: Will do! Good luck, Dalia.                                                                   Dalia: You too!                                                                                     Orion: (Hmmm... while she's doing this, I might as well scout around town. Who knows, I might       stumble upon something useful. Where are you, Coyote...)                                            Dalia: Um... I mean... I guess, it's a big horse. But I'm not sure if I'll be able to control it    with both of us on its back.                                                                        Orion: Then let me take the reins! I'm an experienced horse rider, don't worry.                     Dalia: *Chuckles* An experienced horse rider? Since when? Have you ever ridden a horse before?      Orion: I rode a donkey at a medieval fair when I was 12. I assume it'll be pretty much the same. The carny said, and I quote, that I had “a gift worthy of Sir Richard the Lionheart”. I don't lie, you can ask Annie.                                                                                      Dalia: *Snorts* I will ask her, you can be sure. That's a story I don't wanna miss. But alright,    show me your “gift”, Lionheart. Let's ride together.                                                Orion: With pleasure!                                                                               You effortlessly mount the horse in one jump and extend your hand to Dalia.                         Orion: C'mon!                                                                                       Dalia: O-Okay! Let's go. W-Where am I supposed to put my foot? There's no stirrup.                  Orion: Don't worry about that, just take my hand and I'll pull you up.                              Dalia: O-Okay. O-Oh boy. This looks taller than I expected.                                         Orion: Are you scared of horses? Is that why you don't have one in Ekabar?                          Dalia: I'm not scared of them! I just... respect them.                                              Orion: You need to lose this fear, you'll never embrace your inner Rohirrim otherwise.              Dalia: I said I'm not sca–                                                                          You crack the reins and pop off towards the canyon the sheriff mentioned.                           Dalia: SLOW DOWN!                                                                                   Orion: Go Roach! *Sighs* Aaaaaand... more red rock. Man, this server is as huge as all the others.  *Resuming the march* I hope we didn't take a wrong turn. Are there any other towns in this server,  apart from Blackridge?                                                                              Dalia: . . .                                                                                        Orion: Dalia? Did you fall asleep back there?                                                       Dalia: E-Eh? Ah, no, I'm here. Um... yeah, there are a lot of them. I haven't explored it much, but Alex told me there are dozens of towns, and even a big main city down south. Most of them are       connected by train. We just came to Blackridge because it's where El Coyote is hiding. Allegedly.   Orion: Damn, that's crazy. I wonder how many online players there must be on average.               Dalia: Who knows. Just in Blackridge there must be like... 100 people? Maybe 200 on weekends. In all Frontier Trails... probably thousands. And that's without including the NPCs.                      Orion: Yeah, I found out about that earlier. I was with Alex and we had an incident with some weirdo and an NPC. It was a kid, so... you can imagine which way the wind was blowing.                    Dalia: Ugh, that sounds awful.                                                                      Orion: Oh, it was bad, believe me. What? Are there NPCs in Frontier Trails?                         Dalia: Yeah, I think so. You know how the whole goal of Eternum is to be as immersive as possible.  There are usually some NPCs scattered throughout the servers like these to prevent the worlds from  feeling empty. They can be interacted with, although they don't carry anything valuable and they    can't harm players, so most people just ignore them. In this case I think they're limited to some   ranchers between the main towns.                                                                    Orion: I see. It's crazy when you think about it, you know? I see it very differently now.          Dalia: What do you mean?                                                                            Orion: The NPCs. They're all there... doing their things... even if there isn't any human player to observe them in a 10-mile radius.                                                                   Dalia: Well, we don't know that. Maybe they simply freeze in place when no one's around. Like in Toy Story, but the other way around.                                                                   Orion: *Chuckles* Maybe. Do you ever wonder if all the NPCs were once real people? Like Thanatos?   Dalia: Uhh... huh, I didn't think about it, but it seems unlikely. Just the thought of it sounds    quite dreadful, doesn't it?                                                                         Orion: Yeah... it really does. But you're right, there's no way Ulysses managed to cover so many    disappearances.                                                                                     Dalia: Unless... Ulysses found a way to brainwash and control people from a parallel dimension and  bring them here.                                                                                    Orion: Honestly? We've reached a stage where that wouldn't even surprise me. If I were to wake up   tomorrow inside a Matrix pod, surrounded by tubes connected to me, I'd probably just nod and say    “Oh, well, that actually makes sense, yeah”.                                                        Dalia: *Laughs* Yeah, I'd probably react the same way.                                              Orion: *Stopping the horse* Finally! Are you seeing what I'm seeing?!                               Dalia: Oh fuck...                                                                                   Orion: I know, right?? That's gotta be the damn cabin!                                              Dalia: Um... Orion?                                                                                 Orion: Okay, we don't know if there's anyone inside.                                                Dalia: Orion...                                                                                     Orion: Let's leave the horse here and...                                                            Dalia grabs your head with her hands and turns it towards the massive sandstorm rolling in from the west.                                                                                               Orion: W-What the fuck is that?                                                                     Dalia: A sandstorm! Coming this way!                                                                Orion: Oh shit. What's gonna happen to us if we stay in the open?                                   Dalia: We die!                                                                                      Orion: FUCK! Should we go to the cabin?                                                             Dalia: What? I can't hear you!                                                                      Orion: SHOULD WE GO TO THE CABIN?!                                                                  Dalia: WE SHOULD GO TO THE CABIN IF WE DON'T WANNA DIE!                                             Orion: I CAN'T HEAR YOU, LET'S GO TO THE CABIN! (Holy fuck, this thing is moving fast... we better  hurry.)                                                                                             Dalia: OKAY, I LEFT THE HORSE IN THAT SHED OVER THERE!                                              Orion: ALRIGHT, LET'S GO INSIDE!                                                                    Dalia: OKAY!                                                                                        Orion: *Knocking on the door* HELLO? ANYBODY THERE??                                                . . .                                                                                               Orion: I THINK IT'S EMPTY! I'LL OPEN THE DOOR, WATCH OUT! *Taking a run-up* Haaa... HYA! WHOA,      that's what I call a kick! Nice technique, eh?! Did you see that, Dalia?                            Dalia: *Pushing you inside* Goddammit Orion, shut up and get the fuck in! *Shutting the door* Oof... That was close.                                                                                    Orion: *Standing up* I can't see shit.                                                              Dalia: Yeah, I closed all the window shutters so the sandstorm doesn't shatter the glasses.         Orion: Smart.                                                                                       Dalia: Wait, I think I see a lantern over there.                                                    Orion: That's better!                                                                               Dalia: Alright... it seems to be empty.                                                             Orion: No bears or psychopaths hiding in the shadows.                                               Dalia: I guess the man we were looking for wasn't playing Eternum today.                            Orion: He definitely comes here regularly, though. Look at these logs, they're still red-hot.       Dalia: Hmm, true.                                                                                   Orion: Maybe the sandstorm caught him out of home.                                                  Dalia: If that's the case, he won't last long. Staying outside during one of Frontier Trails'       sandstorms is almost a death sentence. That's why no one dares to venture too far from towns and    main cities. The farther you go, the deadlier they are.                                             Orion: I guess we'll have to stay here for a while, then.                                           Dalia: Yep, at least for a couple of hours. So... you better find us some cards or something.       Orion: Well, I see no cards, but I found the cabin's collection of beverages. What do you say? Fancy a little drink?                                                                                    Dalia: Um... *Chuckles* Sure, why the hell not. Since we're gonna be stuck in here anyway... why not get drunk.                                                                                         Orion: That's the spirit! Cheers to being trapped!                                                  Dalia: *Clears throat* Okay... erm... I would probably... kill Ironman... Fuck Superman, and...     Marry Batman.                                                                                       Orion: Interesting... you're marrying Batman because he's rich, eh? I didn't take you for a gold    digger.                                                                                             Dalia: I'm marrying Batman because he's the cooler one of the three, dumbass.                       Orion: *Chuckles* Can't argue with that.                                                            Dalia: Okay, your turn now. Fuck, marry, kill. Um... Gertrude, my mom's co-worker...                Orion: Oh god.                                                                                      Dalia: Charlotte from school... and... A Praetorian.                                                Orion: Easy. I'd kill...                                                                            Gertrude                                                                                            Orion: Gertrude.                                                                                    Dalia: *Snorts* You didn't even flinch.                                                             Orion: I'd fuck...                                                                                  Charlotte                                                                                           Orion: Charlotte... preferably with her bra on... And I'd marry the Praetorian.                     Dalia: *Snorts* You'd MARRY the Praetorian? You're a fucking weirdo.                                Orion: A loyal wife that can murder my enemies in the blink of an eye? I'm in for that.             Dalia: *Laughs* If you say so.                                                                      Praetorian                                                                                          Orion: The Praetorian. And I'd marry... Charlotte.                                                  Dalia: Why doesn't it surprise me to hear you'd fuck a Praetorian?                                  Orion: I mean, that would be pretty wild.                                                           Dalia: *Laughs* Oh, totally.                                                                        Charlotte                                                                                           Orion: Charlotte. I'd fuck...                                                                       Gertrude                                                                                            Orion: *Shivers* G-Gertrude... Probably after having drunk a whole bottle of booze... And I'd marry the Praetorian.                                                                                     Dalia: *Snorts* You'd MARRY the Praetorian? You're a fucking weirdo.                                Orion: A loyal wife that can murder my enemies in the blink of an eye? I'm in for that.             Dalia: *Laughs* If you say so.                                                                      Praetorian                                                                                          Orion: The Praetorian. And I'd marry Gertrude. A marriage with no sex. And preferably no verbal     interaction.                                                                                        Dalia: Why it doesn't surprise me to hear you'd fuck a Praetorian?                                  Orion: I mean, that would be pretty wild.                                                           Dalia: *Laughs* Oh, totally.                                                                        Praetorian                                                                                          Orion: The Praetorian. I'd fuck...                                                                  Gertrude                                                                                            Orion: *Shivers* G-Gertrude... Probably after having drunk a whole bottle of booze... And I'd marry Charlotte.                                                                                          Dalia: *Snorts* So you're into MILFs, uh? Interesting.                                              Orion: *Laughs* Better than marrying her. She's unbearable, I'd go crazy after the first couple of  days.                                                                                               Charlotte                                                                                           Orion: Charlotte... preferably with her bra on... And I'd marry Gertrude. It'd be funny to see her  face on the altar after realizing my name's not Dalia.                                              Dalia: *Laughs* True! I wouldn't want to miss that.                                                 Orion: Okay, your turn now! Let me think... Let's go with... Jerry, Axel, and... me.                Dalia: Uh... Can I kill two?                                                                        Orion: *Laughs* You can't.                                                                          Dalia: Okay, then... I kill Axel. I marry... Jerry. And I... fuck... you, I guess.                  Orion: Interesting... does Jerry's marriage imply sex?                                              Dalia: Definitely not. It'd be strictly a marriage of convenience.                                  Orion: Oh... so I'd be your lover. Nice...                                                          Dalia: *Laughs* I didn't say that. Don't get your hopes up. Okay, okay, hear me out... Micaela...   Idriel, and... myself.                                                                              Orion: Ah, this is starting to get interesting... Alright, I'd kill...                              Micaela                                                                                             Orion: Micaela, I guess. Please don't tell Chang I said this. I'd fuck...                           Idriel                                                                                              Orion: Idriel. And I'd marry you.                                                                   Dalia: *Clears throat* Oh... okay. Not what I was expecting.                                        Orion: No way I'm wasting a chance to marry you. And don't worry, unlike Jerry's, our marriage also implies lots of sex.                                                                                Dalia: *Snorts* No thanks. Not interested.                                                          You                                                                                                 Orion: You... And I'd marry... Idriel. Being the husband of the Lady of Eternum has to be incredibly beneficial.                                                                                        Dalia: Oh, definitely.                                                                              Idriel                                                                                              Orion: Idriel. I'd fuck...                                                                          Micaela                                                                                             Orion: Micaela. And if I managed to survive that somehow... I'd marry you.                          Dalia: *Clears throat* Oh... okay. Not what I was expecting.                                        Orion: No way I'm wasting a chance to marry you. And don't worry, unlike Jerry's, our marriage also implies lots of sex.                                                                                Dalia: *Snorts* No thanks. Not interested.                                                          You                                                                                                 Orion: You... And I'd marry... Micaela. Also a marriage of convenience. Gotta protect my boy Chang's woman.                                                                                             Dalia: Ah, the bro code.                                                                            Orion: *Chuckles* Correct.                                                                          You                                                                                                 Orion: You. I'd fuck...                                                                             Micaela                                                                                             Orion: Micaela. And if I managed to survive that somehow... I'd marry Idriel.                       Idriel                                                                                              Orion: Idriel. And I'd marry... Micaela. Also a marriage of convenience. Gotta protect my boy       Chang's woman.                                                                                      Dalia: . . .                                                                                        Orion: What?                                                                                        Dalia: Nothing, nothing... Just think of 3 more.                                                    Orion: OH! Okay, I have a good one.                                                                 Dalia: Shoot.                                                                                       Orion: Penny, Alex, and... Annie.                                                                   Dalia: Uh... damn. Okay, I'd... fuck... Alex. We've been friends for so long that I'm sure we'd...  get along well.                                                                                     Orion: The mental image of it definitely sounds good...                                             Dalia: Then I'd marry... Penny. If I'm not the one to put up with her, then who will?               Orion: *Chuckles* I imagined you'd say something like that.                                         Dalia: And... well, to be honest, as much as we get on each other's throats, I love her more than   anything. So... meh, it doesn't sound that bad. We've always lived together, it wouldn't change     much. But don't tell her I said that I love her. And then I'd fuck... Annie. She's so cute. She’s   small, but... in a hot way. You know what I mean?                                                   Orion: You said fuck twice.                                                                         Dalia: Did I? Well, I don't wanna kill anyone.                                                      Orion: But you can't repeat an option, that's not how the game works!                               Dalia: Oh you wanna play that game? Alright: Me, Penny, and mom. Fuck, marry, kill.                 Orion: . . . O-Okay I'd...                                                                          Dalia: . . .                                                                                        Orion: . . . *Clears throat* Hey, there's a dartboard over there! Do you wanna play?                Dalia: *Giggles* Look how fast he wants to switch games now!                                        Orion: I was already planning to.                                                                   Dalia: Sure, sure!                                                                                  Orion: What do you say? The one who gets further from the center each time takes a shot.            Dalia: I don't think I can drink anymore.                                                           Orion: Then...                                                                                      Dalia: Ah, I know that look. Here comes something dirty.                                            Orion: The loser takes off a piece of clothing.                                                     Dalia: Bingo. Strip darts?                                                                          Orion: Strip darts indeed. Registered trademark.                                                    Dalia: Hmm... . . .                                                                                 Orion: I like that smirk.                                                                           Dalia: Might be this homemade whiskey talking, but... fuck it, alright. Let's do this.              Orion: Wait... really?                                                                              Dalia: *Leaning forward* Yeah... why not. I'm not one to shy away from a competition, no matter the circumstances. Let's make it interesting. The game... is on.                                        Orion: You know, I've always loved your competitive side...                                         Dalia stands up with determination and grabs one of the darts.                                      Orion: Do you wanna make a few test throws?                                                         Dalia: I need no tests. You can start taking off your shoes, though. It'll save us time.            Orion: *Chuckles* You'll pay for that overconfidence.                                               Dalia: Just watch. Straight to the center.                                                          Orion: HAH!                                                                                         Dalia: Dammit. I drank too much.                                                                    Orion: *Grabbing a blue dart* This will be the easiest competition in the history of competitions.  Don't try to find excuses.                                                                          Dalia: *Chuckles* Shut up and throw it already. Just make sure not to hit me.                       Orion: Yes!                                                                                         Dalia: Huh, nice one.                                                                               Orion: Thank you.                                                                                   Dalia: Beginner's luck.                                                                             Orion: More like pure skill.                                                                        Dalia: *Laughs* Sure...                                                                             Dalia slowly removes her boots and leaves them under the table.                                     Orion: Wow... Your legs really look as if they were sculpted in marble.                             Dalia: *Giggles playfully* Shut up and play, Michelangelo.                                          Dalia unbuttons her corset and takes it off.                                                        Orion: Nice... I really like this game...                                                           Dalia: I-I think there's something wrong with my dart. Let me use yours.                            Orion: No way! I got used to this one already.                                                      Dalia: So you're admitting that they're not the same?                                               Orion: Mmm... Okay, fine, I'll use the red one. But if I win... I get to suck your tits.            Dalia: What?! You're dreaming.                                                                      Orion: No deal then.                                                                                Dalia: . . . You can lick my ankles.                                                                Orion: Your tits.                                                                                   Dalia: My legs.                                                                                     Orion: Your abs.                                                                                    Dalia: . . . Okay, my abs.                                                                          Orion: Oh boy... one of my fantasies is about to come true.                                         Dalia: *Giggles* And now you throw the darts like a professional??                                  Orion: Mm-hm... Because I AM a professional! I almost hit the center!                               Dalia: *Grumbling* Make room! *Takes a deep breath* AAGH! NO FUCKING WAY!!! You had to have your    lucky throw just when I finally got the hang of it!                                                 Orion: *Chuckles* It is what it is...                                                               Dalia: *Sighs* Okay, okay, fine... Let's get it over with.                                          Orion: Oh yes, finally... Are you wearing a bra?                                                    Dalia: You know I'm not.                                                                            Orion: Oh dear...                                                                                   Dalia: Why are you so excited? You've seen me naked already.                                        Orion: Seeing a girl like you naked will always be as exciting as the first time. You wouldn't      understand.                                                                                         Dalia: Hmm.                                                                                         Dalia slowly opens her shirt, revealing her nicely shaped breasts and her well-toned abdomen to you.Orion: WHOA... You always leave me speechless...                                                    Dalia: Mm-hm.                                                                                       Orion: (God, her tummy is so fucking sexy...)                                                       Dalia: . . . (Why is him looking at my body with such lewdness turning me on? Why am I enjoying     this? I'm enjoying losing a game! Am I giving up my principles...?) W-What are you doing?!          Orion: You said I'd get to lick your abs if I won.                                                  Dalia: W-What? For real? I thought you were kidding.                                                Orion: Kidding? I've been fantasizing about it since I saw you in all your glory that day in your   beach.                                                                                              Dalia: Um... Well, o-okay, I guess. If it's part of the game... B-But be quick.                     Orion: Of course...                                                                                 You can feel Dalia's whole body shuddering and her sparse, blonde body hair standing on end the     moment you touch her stomach.                                                                       Dalia: Hmph!                                                                                        Orion: You okay?                                                                                    Dalia: Y-Yeah, you just... tickled me.                                                              You start licking Dalia's stomach, taking pleasure in each one of her body's involuntary reactions. Orion: (Man... I'd eat her whole if I could. Her smell is incredible. We've been riding a horse for hours, drinking some weird homemade booze, but her own scent covers it all somehow.                 Dalia: God, this is awkward. Very awkward. Incredibly awkward.) . . . (Why... Why is it turning me  on, then...? Goddammit, Dalia... I better stop it before... I...) O-Okay, this is enough. You had   your fun embarrassing me already.                                                                   Orion: *Standing up* Certainly. But I've gotta say, you taste really good.                          Dalia: *Snorts* If you say so.                                                                      Orion: Did you enjoy it too? I don't remember seeing your nipples so hard when we started.          Dalia: *Giggles* Oh, shut up and let's continue playing. Although... I only have my panties left to lose, so I don't think the game is gonna last.                                                      Orion: Oh, do you accept your defeat?                                                               Dalia: Yeah, yeah, you win. You're way better than me at darts. Happy?                              Orion: Well... since it's the last round... we can raise the stakes a little. What about...         Dalia: *Imitating your voice* If I win, I get another blowjob... Something like that?               Orion: Um...                                                                                        Dalia: *Taking her shirt off* We know each other pretty well already, Orion.                        Orion: (Jesus Christ, look at that body...)                                                         Dalia: You're... predictable. Especially when you're horny.                                         Orion: So...                                                                                        Dalia: Yeah, no. As I said, it's obvious that you're better than me.                                Orion: Then I'll throw the dart with the gloves on, to even the odds. That makes it way more        difficult.                                                                                          Dalia: Hmm. And... you have to throw it with your eyes closed.                                      Orion: What?!                                                                                       Dalia: And... if I win... it's YOU who has to give ME head.                                         Orion: Wha– (Oh my god. OH GOD. Calm down, Orion. Don't let her see that it's a win-win for you no  matter what.) Um... a-alright. Seems fair.                                                          Dalia: Good, then. I go first.                                                                      Orion: Now THE GAME is on.                                                                          Dalia: Hmm... (I can't believe I really asked him to go down on me. Alex is such a bad influence, I shouldn't listen to her. And I can't believe I actually got horny enough to ask him to do that      either. Alcohol is also a bad influence. I should stick to the irons. They'd never betray me.)      Orion: In another situation I'd probably rush you, but I'm enjoying the view too much for that.     Dalia: O-Oh, yeah, sorry! *Taking a deep breath* Here I go. Oh! OHH! YAY! I told you I had gotten   the hang of it! BULLSEYE!                                                                           Orion: Don't celebrate ahead of time...                                                             Dalia: Come on! Have you seen that?! It's literally at the center!                                  Orion: Just watch and see...                                                                        Dalia snorts playfully, handing you a dart and carefully watching you to ensure you don't open your eyes.                                                                                               Orion: *Taking a deep breath* Let me calculate the effect of the wind...                            Dalia: W-WHAT?! What the hell?!                                                                     Orion: Can I open my eyes now?                                                                      Dalia: How the fuck did you do that?!                                                               Orion: Oh, bullseye!                                                                                Dalia: *Giggles* Don't bullshit me, you cheated!                                                    Orion: No, I didn't!                                                                                Dalia: You used your powers!                                                                        Orion: I used all my skills available. That's not cheating in my books.                             Dalia: Hah! I should have established the rules earlier.                                            Orion: Well... I guess it's a tie. Should we throw again?                                           Dalia: Hmm... Either that, or... *Giggles* Nah, forget it. I'm getting carried away.                Orion: I want you to get carried away so bad, Dalia... Let's just say what crosses our minds. Full  transparency. We're in a cabin in the middle of nowhere, who cares?                                 Dalia: Erm... I guess... you got a point.                                                           Orion: What did you think about?                                                                    Dalia: Well... it's just that... Since we both “won”... What about... breaking the tie with one last challenge? *Giggles playfully* I can't believe I'm the one suggesting this and not you. I'll admit that I'm a bit turned on right now.                                                                 Orion: Please, tell me you're suggesting a 69...                                                    Dalia: I mean... with what we already did at The Cove server... It's not... weird, right? Is it     weird?                                                                                              Orion: Absolutely not.                                                                              Dalia: So I thought... The first one to make the other cum... wins?                                 You rip your shirt off and roughly pull Dalia towards you. She doesn't resist at all.               Orion: Fuck, you have no fucking idea of how much you're turning me on right now, Dalia.            Dalia: Easy win for me, then.                                                                       Orion: Hell no, I'm gonna eat your pussy so raw that you're gonna cum in 10 seconds.                Dalia: Now it's you who's being overly confident, Orion...                                          Orion: Have I told you how fucking much I love your competitive side?                               Dalia: *Giggles* I bet you'll like it even more now...                                              Dalia pushes you to the ground, positioning herself above you, with her legs on either side.        Orion: Oh my goodness gracious... Take off your panties... Oh Jesus...                              You grab Dalia by her huge buttocks and pull her to the ground. You open her ass cheeks, exposing   her swollen, already wet pussy.                                                                     Orion: (Oh man, this is happening...                                                                Dalia: Oh shit. It is happening. I'm doing a 69. With Orion.)                                       Orion: Fuck, I can't wait any longer...                                                             Without giving her a second to breathe, you start attacking Dalia's swollen lips.                   Dalia: Hmph! Hmmmmhhh.... (Holy fuck, he's not wasting a second...) *Moaning* Mmmm... (And that     feels good...) *Pulling your trousers down* (You've gotta keep up your game, Dalia...) Mmmm...      Orion: (Oh my goooooddd...)                                                                         Dalia: *Moaning* Mmmm...                                                                            You feel your dick head disappear inside of Dalia's mouth, even though you can't actually see it.   Orion: (My god...)                                                                                  You get fully erect in a matter of seconds, as she quickly covers your cock in saliva.              Orion: (I can't even concentrate properly on her... She's not only sucking my cock... the things she does with her tongue... she moves it in circles like a swirling vortex while she moves up and down. This is not gonna last long...)                                                                    Dalia: Mmmmmm... (Fuck... this is absolutely amazing... This is so fucking hot. I want this to last forever... But you've gotta win, Dalia. I have to squeeze him to the fullest...)                    Almost as if you could read each other's thoughts, you two up your pace at the same time, determined to make the other cum first.                                                                       Orion: (OH GOD.                                                                                     Dalia: OH JESUS...                                                                                  Orion: Shit, I'm gonna cum too fast...                                                              Dalia: Fuck, I'm gonna cum... I'm not used to this sensation, it's not fair...                      Orion: You just lost your battle of power against Calypso, Orion. You can't lose here too... But... Fuck, Dalia's technique is just too fucking goooood....)                                            Dalia: Mmmmmh... (I am enjoying sucking his cock as much as him eating my pussy... What the hell is wrong with me...)                                                                                   After spending a few minutes in complete silence, only interrupted by Dalia's moans and whimpers,   you start to feel the climax really close.                                                          Orion: (Shit, this is amazing...)                                                                   You lick up and down her perfectly shaved pussy and press your tongue in as far as you can get it.  Dalia: Mmmmh... *Moaning more intensely* MMMmmm!!                                                   Orion: (She's also close...)                                                                        Dalia: *Catching her breath* AAAaaaagh!                                                             Orion: Oh, Dalia...                                                                                 Dalia: You're not gonna win...                                                                      Orion: It's you who won't be able to– (OH MY GOD.)                                                  You suddenly feel your cock completely penetrating Dalia's throat, forcing you to stop your task for a second.                                                                                          Orion: (OH FUCK. There's no way on earth she's doing that with her mouth... My god..... How the hell can she take it so deep?? Her throat offers no resistance at all... As if it lets me stretch it at will... O-O-Ohh shit I'm gonna cum. Come on, Orion, make her cum first! Suck her clit. You can do   it...)

Dalia orgasms, squeezing her legs together with astonishing force, and covering you in her juices.  Dalia: H-H-Holy fuck, Orion... Y-You son of a b-biiitch...                                          Orion: I-I can't breathe...                                                                         Dalia: *Rolling onto her side and clumsily standing up* Lord have mercy... That was... WOW. I have  trouble standing upright. I've never been happier to lose in a game in my life.                     You grab Dalia's butt and you turn her around, slamming her against the table.                      Orion: I swear this booty of yours should be worshipped, Dal.                                       Dalia: I don't know what you're trying to do, but I can still smack your face, you know? Get off me.Orion: I just want to cum with you... take it as my prize for winning.                              Dalia: We're not gonna f-fuck. A-And I'm not giving you more head. My jaw hurts. Just t-take your   victory home.                                                                                       Orion: I just wanna finish using these glorious ass cheeks of yours...                              Dalia: My... ass cheeks?                                                                            Orion: Yeah, just... Like this...                                                                   Dalia: AAahh...                                                                                     You use Dalia's dripping juices to lubricate her own buttocks and use them as your personal toy,    sliding your cock between them with ease.                                                           Orion: Oh fuck yes... (Dalia's ass is so huge... it almost envelopes my entire cock. And I love how soft it feels when she's not flexing it... If I close my eyes it almost feels as if I was fucking   her...)                                                                                             Dalia lets out a soft moan each time your cock rubs against her swollen, still sensitive pussy.     Dalia: Aaahhh...

Orion: OH FUCK YES...                                                                               Dalia: AAahh...                                                                                     Orion: God, Dalia... Everything about your body is so perfect... Firm and tight in all the right    places... and irresistibly soft where it's meant to be... You drive me insane...                    Dalia: AAaahh...                                                                                    Orion: I wanna fuck you so bad... I want to bone you until neither of us can walk straight...       Dalia: AAahh... Not... N-Not now. Not here...                                                       Orion: Does that mean... that you want me to fuck you another day...?                               Dalia: I... M-Maybe in... another s-situation. Now s-shut up and hit me harder...                   Orion: Oh babe...                                                                                   Slap her ass                                                                                        Dalia: AAAAahhggg.... Mmmmmhm...                                                                    Orion: Was it too much? Did I hit you too hard?                                                     Dalia: N-No... it's okay...                                                                         Orion: Tough girl...                                                                                Dalia: AAaaahh...                                                                                   Orion: Fuck, you have such sensitive skin, it's already all red...                                  Dalia: *Playfully moaning* Mm-hm...                                                                 Orion: You did love that, right, you naughty girl?                                                  Dalia: F-Fuck yes...                                                                                Orion: Oh boy... So you like it rough, eh...?                                                       Dalia: *Giggles* I d-don't know... m-maybe.                                                         Orion: Just like her sis... interesting. I guess it's in the genes...                               Dalia: Eh...? Penny?                                                                                Orion: Yeah... she drank Veritaserum when we went to the Warthogs server and she admitted to...     liking it rough.                                                                                    Dalia: Hah... I knew it.                                                                            Orion: Fuck, this feels so good, Dalia...                                                           Dalia: I... I c-can take it harder than her.                                                        Orion: Huh...?                                                                                      Dalia: I-I'm sure I can take it WAY harder than Penny...                                            Orion: Oh god...                                                                                    Dalia: Spank me harder...                                                                           Orion: Oh baby...                                                                                   Dalia: Fuck, I guess I do...                                                                        Spank her again                                                                                     Dalia: AAAAahhggg.... Mmmmmmm... (Shit... I really like this... What is wrong with me... I love how he's slamming his hips against mine... How his balls pound my pussy with each thrust...) *Moaning*  Mmmm... (God, he's so strong. I almost would like to... Do I really want Orion to... fuck me? Fuck, who am I kidding, OF COURSE I DO... He's... the one...) MMMmmmmmmmhhmmm...                          Continue the butt job                                                                               Orion: Aaagh fuck yes...                                                                            Continue the butt job                                                                               Orion: Aaagh fuck yes...                                                                            Penetrate her                                                                                       Orion: I can't bear it anymore, Dalia... My instincts are taking control of me...                   Dalia: *Panting* A-Are you done...?                                                                 Orion: Almost... AaAaaaaghh... YEAH!                                                                Dalia: EE-E-EGH...?!                                                                                Orion: OH GOD, IT'S SO FUCKING TIGH– AAAAghh... W-Why did you hit me... *Standing up* Agh... what is wrong with you? What a way to kill the mood...                                                     Dalia: ME?! What the fuck is wrong with YOU?!                                                       Orion: I-I thought it's what we both wanted!                                                        Dalia: Are you fucking serious right now? Didn't you hear me saying I did NOT want that?! Oh my god, I feel so... violated. This was a huge mistake.                                                    Orion: Come on, there's no need to make a fuss about it.                                            Dalia: Can you shut the fuck up, you fucking pig? It might not mean shit to you, but to me, I... I  want my first... Y-You know what? I don't have to give you any fucking explanations. Forget me.     Dalia starts picking up her clothes and getting dressed.                                            Orion: Okay, okay, I fucked up, I'm sorry. We have to come back to the town together, so it'll be   better if–                                                                                          Dalia: I'll take the horse. Alone.                                                                  Orion: And how am I going back?                                                                     Dalia: *Slamming the door* FIGURE IT OUT!                                                           Orion: *Sighs* (Damn, she's angry. I shouldn't have done that... But well, it's not the first time  she’s reacted like this. I'll give her a couple of days, and then everything will be back to normal. Or so I hope... At least the storm seems to be over. I'll have to steal that emaciated horse I saw at the shed next to the cabin. Man, this is gonna be one long way back...) *Panting* Shit, I'm      almost there... I'm g-gonna cum, Dalia...                                                           Dalia gracefully lifts her legs and rolls over, settling on her back with poise.                    Orion: Fuck, Dalia, you're not gonna leave me hanging now, right...? I don't even know how I've     managed to last for so long...                                                                      Dalia: I want you to finish on... my face. Not on my back.                                          Orion: Do you want... a facial?                                                                     Dalia: Is that okay...?                                                                             Orion: What kind of question is that? Come here...                                                  You get closer to Dalia and after so long, it only takes you a couple of strokes to unload          everything you've been holding in.                                                                  Orion: AAAAAAAAARGHHHHH.... FUCK YESSS... Oh my fucking god... I left my balls empty...             Dalia: I can see that... AAaahh...                                                                  Orion: Oh Lord, Dalia...                                                                            Dalia leans forward and starts skillfully polishing your cock head, swallowing it all and not       leaving a trace of cum behind.                                                                      Dalia: *Swallowing* MMMMmmmmhh...                                                                   Orion: O-O-Oh my god... You're gonna end up developing a fetish for swallowing my cum...            Dalia: *Giggles* If I don't have it already...                                                      Orion: Good grief... Each thing you say makes me obsess more about you.                             Dalia: I hope you enjoyed the... competition. I certainly did... even if I lost.                    Orion: I'd say it's been more of a tie.                                                             Dalia: *Giggles* Yeah. I like that better...                                                        Dalia comes down from the table and grabs a rag from the kitchen to clean her face.                 Dalia: Damn, my butt is burning like hell. I bet you left a mark.                                   Orion: A mark...? Maybe a bit. You can hardly see it.                                               Dalia: *Giggles* You're a terrible liar, Orion. *Sniffing the rag* This is an... intense smell.     Orion: (She's a devious freak... I love it.) *Cumming inside Dalia's throat* AAAAAAAAARGHHHHH....   AAAAAHH YEAaahhh... *Still cumming* Oo-Ohhhh... F-Fuck yes... Take it all, babe...                  Dalia: *Swallowing* MMMMmmmmhh...                                                                   Orion: Good girl... You like that, don't you?                                                       Dalia: *Assertively* Mm-hmm...                                                                      Dalia laps every last bit of cum, skillfully licking your cock until it gleams, leaving not a trace behind.                                                                                             Dalia: F-Fuck... you're gonna make me develop a fetish for this...                                  Orion: Yes, please...                                                                               Dalia: *Rolling onto her side and clumsily standing up* A-Anyways... I think t-this is a v-victory! Orion: I've never been happier to lose a game. That was simply too much for me to handle...         Dalia: It really was... my jaw hurts.                                                               Orion: When it comes to this, you're a goddess...                                                   Dalia: *Giggles* T-Thanks.                                                                          You both pick up the clothes scattered through the cabin and start getting dressed.                 Dalia: This was fun.                                                                                Orion: I'm glad we share the same opinion.                                                          Dalia: It's certainly been... a way to pass the time until the sandstorm was over.                  Orion: Oh wow, the sandstorm, it's true. I had forgotten about it.                                  Dalia: I wonder why...                                                                              Orion: I was too focused on more important things.                                                  Dalia: I bet.                                                                                       Orion: Hey, a wise man knows the importance of setting his priorities right.                        Dalia: *Sighs* I guess we have to go back to town now, though. By the time we get there it'll       already be night time. Too bad the whole trip has been in vain. The cabin was empty and we didn't   discover anything about El Coyote or the Gem of Doom.                                               Orion: Well, I wouldn't say in vain...                                                              Dalia: *Snorts* Hmm. Come on, let's go back to Blackridge.                                          Orion: Let's go! *Stepping out of the cabin* Wow... what a view.                                    Dalia: Yeah, the sandstorms take all the clouds with them.                                          Orion: The mortal danger they involve seems almost worth it now.                                    Dalia: *Chuckles* For real.                                                                         You lead the horse to the nearby pond so she can drink before making your way back.                 Dalia: *Patting the horse* Easy, girl... Everything's over, it's safe now...                        Orion: Is she okay?                                                                                 Dalia: Yeah, just a bit startled because of the storm. But she seems to be calming down now that she drank some water. I'm gonna climb up that hill to make sure we're going in the right direction.    It'll be already dark by the time we get to Blackridge, so we won't be able to use the sun to orient ourselves.                                                                                         Orion: Alright! *Patting the horse* Easy now, Roach. That storm was scary, eh? Don't worry, we all  get scared sometimes. Dalia was scared to ride you before coming here, and look at her now.         Dalia: *Laughs* I can hear you, you know? *Walking backwards* I told you I'm not scared of horses!  *Stepping on the rope* In Ekabar I've literally ridden grypho– Huh...? U-U-U-UHHH...?! W-What the   fuck?!                                                                                              Orion: Fuck, Dalia! Are you okay?! What happened?                                                   Dalia: I-I don't know, I think I stepped on a trap!                                                 Orion: *Letting out a cheeky chuckle* O-Okay, let me help you get down.                             Dalia: I heard you laughing!                                                                        Orion: *Chuckles* I mean, it's pretty comical seeing you like this.                                 Dalia: Oh, yeah, super funny! Next time you're the one trapped I'm gonna laugh too! This could ha–  Shit, Orion, be careful! Behind you!                                                                Orion: *Turning around* Huh? Oh fuck... *Gulps* Um... h-hey buddy! Great day to fish, eh? (We're    dead.)                                                                                              Boone: *In a surprising high-pitched voice* Hah! You can say that again, buddy! Pleased to meet     another fishing enjoyer, the name's Boone.                                                          Orion: Oh. That wasn't the reaction I was expecting. But... nice to meet you!                       Boone: You say that because of my appearance?                                                       Orion: Well...                                                                                      Boone: Haha! I get that a lot, no worries. I usually scare people off because I'm a big guy and I   look kind of angry. Blame my father for this angry grin! Sorry about that, miss. I just set a few   traps around in an attempt to catch the Chupacabra.                                                 Dalia: D-Don't worry. I'm actually relieved to see that you're a nice guy.                          Orion: Did you say... the Chupacabra?                                                               Boone: Yeah! A creature that attacks and drinks the blood of livestock. I've seen him a couple of   times at night, but the little rascal always gets away from me.                                     Orion: That's so cool! What's it look like?                                                         Boone: It's like a mix between a dog and a big boar. Picture this: it's got these cool spines all   along its back, and its fangs are absolutely massive. Quite a sight, I tell you! He's smaller than  Bigfoot, but much more elusive.                                                                     Orion: Are there Bigfoots in these mountains too?!                                                  Boone: Indeed! I saw one last month. But they're gentle creatures, so I try to protect them from    other hunters. I was actually leaving them some food in a nearby cave when the sandstorm started.   Orion: Wow! I'd love to see one.                                                                    Boone: If you like mythological creatures, you should visit the Tumbleweed server. The old mines are infested with Wendigos.                                                                            Orion: Oh, yeah! I heard about that place!                                                          Boone: According to what people say, a group of NPCs was stuck inside the old mines for weeks. After weeks trapped, they ended up having to resort to cannibalism, so they were cursed and turned into  Wendigos, ghoul-like monsters that devour people.                                                   Orion: Wow...                                                                                       Boone: Of course, these are all rumors, but... you never know. Look at the werewolf attacks from The Red Herring.                                                                                       Orion: Oh my, tell me more about that!                                                              Dalia: . . . *Clears throat* That sounds fascinating, guys, but... my blood is starting to rush to  my head, you know.                                                                                  Boone: *Drawing his revolver* Oh shit, I'm sorry, miss. I get sidetracked sometimes.                Dalia: Wait, wait, wait, are you gonna try to shoot the rope?! What if you hit me?!                 Boone: Don't worry, my aim is excellent!                                                            Dalia: B-But–                                                                                       Boone: Ouch, you okay?                                                                              Dalia: *Muffled voice* ...y-yeah. *Muffled voice* Thank you.                                        Boone: Anyway, I don't wanna bother you any more, guys. And sorry again about the trap.             Orion: Actually, we came here looking for you. We were hoping you could help us find El Coyote. He  has... something we need.                                                                           Boone: Ugh, my old gang leader? Those were bad times. I didn't like their modus operandi, so I quit the gang.                                                                                           Dalia: *Standing up* Do you know where we could find him? We just know he wears a red bandana and   has blue eyes.                                                                                      Boone: If he's in Eternum, he'll be either in this server, or one of the other two bases we used to have. I have some maps and indications in my cabin back there, I could give them to you.            Orion: Really? You don't mind?                                                                      Boone: Not at all. I owe him nothing. He was a nasty man. He wanted to hunt down all the Bigfoots,  can you believe it?                                                                                 Orion: *Gasps* Despicable!                                                                          Dalia: Will it take long? I should really log off soon, mom gets mad if we're still playing by      dinner time.                                                                                        Boone: Maybe a bit, but no worries, there's another Exit Portal not too far from here. You don't    have to go back to Blackridge.                                                                      Orion: Hmmm... at least one of us should go back to Blackridge, though. To tell Alex and Calypso    what we found out, and let them know we're okay.                                                    Dalia: Yeah, that might be best... You go back to Blackridge. I'll go with Boone to learn about El  Coyote's hiding spots. If... he doesn't mind.                                                       Boone: Not at all, miss. I like to help kind people. And I'll be happy to show you my cabin.        Orion: Oh... actually, we saw it already. We took shelter there during the sandstorm.               Dalia: Y-Yeah, sorry if some things are... out of place.                                            Boone: Ah, I recognize that sudden blush, miss! Don't worry guys, you're not the first couple to    make love in my cabin during a sandstorm. It's quite a love nest, eh?                               Dalia: W-What?! W-We didn't! I mean... w-we didn't have... sex. We... Well... it depends on what you mean by “sex”. I guess that... *Clears throat* A-Anyway, let's go to the cabin, yeah. I'll help    you... sweep up.                                                                                    Boone: *Chuckles* Ah, I love young love! Alright guys, let's get going, then. If you really want to go to Blackridge today you'll have to hurry up.                                                     Orion: Yes, sir! Thank you so much for helping us.                                                  Boone: Don't mention it.                                                                            Orion: Well, I'll take Roach with me, then. Don't worry, I'll take good care of her.                Dalia: *Chuckles* I'm sure you will.                                                                Orion: I'll see you later at home.                                                                  Dalia: Sure. And... hey, thank you.                                                                 Orion: Huh?                                                                                         Dalia: Thank you for... respecting me. You know, back there in the cabin.                           Orion: Hmm? Is this... you being sarcastic because of the spanking?                                 Dalia: *Laughs* Nah, that was actually... surprisingly stimulating.                                 Orion: Is this... you being ironic?                                                                 Dalia: *Laughs* No! I mean that... I know you'd probably have liked to do “more”. But I didn't want to. And you didn't pressure me. I appreciate that.                                                  Orion: Of course, Dalia. We were just having fun there. If one of us stops being comfortable with   something, it stops being fun.                                                                      Dalia: We certainly did have fun, yes...                                                            Orion: If you ever want to have some more fun... you know where to find me.                         Dalia: *Chuckles* Oh, I'm sure you're always up for some... fun. See you later, Orion.              Orion: Goodbye, Dalia. Well, looks like it's just you and me now, Roach. I hope you like my company, because it's quite a long road back to Blackridge.                                                 Boone: You ready, miss?                                                                             Dalia: Sure!                                                                                        Boone: I've gotta ask, what's your favorite species of sturgeon fish? I can prepare you a quick     snack.                                                                                              Dalia: Um... are there more than one?                                                               Boone: What?! There are dozens of them!                                                             Dalia: Really?                                                                                      Boone: I can give you a quick summary, don't worry!                                                 Dalia: Erm...                                                                                       Boone: First, the White Sturgeon, native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. Believe it or   not, they can reach lengths of over 20 feet!                                                        Dalia: ...a-aha.                                                                                    Orion: *Laughs* Looks like Dalia won't be bored either. (Mmm... so many people in here.)            Player: Step right up, folks! This miracle tonic will harden your dick faster than a horse can      gallop!                                                                                             Player: Hats and duster coats at half price... buy your new hat here...                             Player: Come try Ol' Terry's Brothel, gentlemen! We have the best ladies in all of Eternum!         Orion: (I feel like more players have arrived since I first logged in.) *Sighs* (Good luck trying to find Alex.)                                                                                        Alex: BOO!                                                                                          Orion: *Falling down* GGGGHhh... C-CAN YOU STOP DOING THAT?!                                        Alex snorts, trying to hold her laugh.                                                              Orion: *Standing up and dusting yourself off* Why?!                                                 Alex: *Giggles* Cause it's funny!                                                                   Orion: Oh, yeah, hilarious. Laugh now while you can, Alex. I'll get you back one day... beware!     Alex: Sure, sure, I've been waiting since the last time you said that.                              Orion: Just wait...                                                                                 Alex: *Giggles* Anyways, cowboy... tell me, did you discover anything?                              Orion: About El Coyote? Nah, not much. Dalia and I got a tip from the sheriff, but I'm still not    sure if it'll pan out. About El Coyote? Nah, not yet. I've been mostly wandering around town.       Alex: Oh, really...? Because I saw you going into that hotel with Calypso.                          Orion: W-What? When?                                                                                Alex: A while ago. Is there something I need to know?                                               Orion: Um... no. It's not what it seems.                                                            Alex: You're not fucking our Weapon of Atlas, right Orion?                                          Orion: O-Of course not! We had an incident with some stupid clerk that shot the deputy, and she     ended up covered in blood. She was nauseated, so I accompanied her to the hotel so she could bathe  and clean herself.                                                                                  Alex: You sure? No sex with our super-advanced-AI Princess until today's mission is over, Orion.    Orion: I-I didn't have sex with anyone! I've been busy enough trying to avoid the Praetorians all   over the town. Praetorians are in the town, so I preferred to keep a low profile and not start      asking questions to everyone.                                                                       Alex: Ah, yeah, I saw them. I don't know why they are here, but if we don't get in their way we     should be fine.                                                                                     Orion: In the saloon they said they were looking for some kind of cube-like object.                 Alex: A cube? Hmm... I wonder what that could be.                                                   Orion: No idea. But I doubt it's related to the Gems of Doom. Or to El Coyote for that matter.      Alex: Ah, yes, speaking of which, I got a promising lead. The mine foreman spilled the beans and    said El Coyote is, as we suspected, hiding out in this server. According to him, he stands out with his piercing blue eyes and a red bandana always covering his face.                                  Orion: Blue eyes and a red bandana, huh... That's good info.                                        Alex: I think we should start checking out all the buildings until–                                 Alex suddenly stops talking and looks behind you.                                                   Orion: Huh? You okay?                                                                               Alex: You've got to be kidding me... Are you seeing that guy over there? Under the mine's ramp.     Orion: Shit, a red bandana! Is that our guy?                                                        Alex: *Hiding behind the corner* I don't know... but it's possible. Does he look like the leader of a gang to you? Or... a Gem of Doom owner? He looks pretty normal to me.                             Orion: Well, not everyone has to look like a destroyer of worlds like Thanatos. I look pretty       “normal” too and I have two Gems of Doom.                                                           Alex: Hah, yeah, fair enough. That's why you're the perfect holder. Most players wouldn't even      bother looting you.                                                                                 Orion: Really? Do I look that amateur?                                                              Alex: You look like someone who just started playing Eternum today, a total noob.                   Orion: Goddammit, I've gotta get myself some flaming horns...                                       The man turns around and disappears behind the wooden structure.                                    Alex: Look, he's moving! Alright, this is our chance! We can't let him get away! We have to find out where he's hiding. It's highly likely he's not carrying the Gem of Doom with him at the moment.    Orion: Gotcha. Stealth mode, activated. Let's get him!                                              You follow the man to a deserted area behind the mine.                                              Orion: *Whispering* What is he doing?                                                               Alex: *Whispering* I don't know. Smuggling?                                                         Orion: *Whispering* That would check out. *Whispering* Do we have a plan?                           Alex: *Whispering* I certainly don't. *Whispering* Should we knock him out?                         Orion: *Whispering* I mean, we don't even know if he's El Coyote.                                   Alex: *Whispering* Mmm, fair enough. *Whispering* Okay, I have an idea.                             Orion: *Whispering* Enlighten me.                                                                   Alex: *Whispering* We sneak up behind him and... And... aaahh... aaaaahhh... *Sneezes* Ah-choo!     Orion: Shit.                                                                                        Player: *Grabbing his revolver* What the fuck was that... HELLO?                                    Alex: Shit, shit, shit... we're fucked!                                                             Orion: What the hell, I thought you were not supposed to have symptoms inside Eternum!              Alex: I-I don't know, maybe I sneezed in the real world, or... or my brain still thinks I'm sick, I don't know!                                                                                         Orion: What do we do? He's coming!                                                                  Alex: Fuck, I-I don't know! If we start running he'll see us and probably flee to another server.   B-But if we attack him we might never know where he hid the Gem!                                    Punch me                                                                                            Orion: Punch me!                                                                                    Alex: What?!                                                                                        Orion: If he sees us here doing nothing he'll suspect us! We've gotta fake a fight!                 Alex: A fight...? That's not gonna work.                                                            Player: *Speaking from behind the corner* I know you're there... SHOW UP!                           Orion: *Whispering* Quickly! Hit me in the stomac– . . .                                            Player: *Jumping from the corner* Hands up!                                                         Orion: *Collapsing to the ground* My stomach....                                                    Player: W-What is going on here?                                                                    Alex: This fucking creep didn't understand what a “no” means, that's what happened. Are you his     friend? Do you want some medicine too?                                                              Kiss me                                                                                             Orion: Kiss me!                                                                                     Alex: I'm sorry...?                                                                                 Orion: If he sees us here doing nothing he'll suspect us! But if he sees us kissing he'll think     we're just a couple trying to find a quieter spot!                                                  Alex: What kind of fucked-up plan is that? Do you think we're in some sort of rom-com or what?      Orion: Well, if you have a better idea, I'm all ears!                                               Alex: I do have a better idea, actually. Listen, we have to–                                        Player: *Speaking from behind the corner* I know you're there... SHOW UP!                           Orion: . . .                                                                                        Player: *Jumping from the corner* Hands up!                                                         Orion: *Collapsing to the ground* My stomach....                                                    Player: W-What is going on here?                                                                    Alex: This fucking creep didn't understand what a “no” means, that's what happened. Are you his     friend? Do you want some medicine too?                                                              You grab Alex and push her against the wall.                                                        Orion: (Shit, was I too rough?)                                                                     Alex: . . .                                                                                         Orion: (I can never guess what Alex is thinking.) Um... maybe we shou–                              Alex grabs you by the collar of your shirt, pulling you closer until your lips meet.                Orion: . . .                                                                                        Alex: . . .                                                                                         Almost without any conscious realization, you suddenly find yourself immersed in a deep, intense    kiss.                                                                                               Player: *Jumping from the corner* Hands up! . . . Oh.                                               Your lips mash against Alex's in perfect sync, as she hungrily pushes back, tangling her tongue with yours.                                                                                             Orion: (My god...)                                                                                  She even lets out a soft moan when you squeeze her ass.                                             Alex: Mmm...                                                                                        Reluctantly, but with a lingering touch, Alex pulls away from the kiss, her eyes searching yours for reassurance.                                                                                       Orion: Whoa...                                                                                      Alex: . . . Um... *Clears throat* A-AHEM! *Pushing you away* W-What are you looking at, weirdo?? Do you want tickets to watch the show?!                                                                Player: Whoa, whoa, take it easy, miss. I'm just here to sell grade-one opium. I thought you were   one of my competitors, or... worse, the Sheriff's deputy.                                           Alex: Well, as you see, I'm neither. So get the fuck out of my sight.                               Player: Heh, with pleasure. Have a nice day, miss.                                                  The dealer holsters his weapon and goes back to his business.                                       Orion: Wow... That was... the most intense kiss of my life.                                         Alex: Y-Yeah, well, I... I wanted to make it believable.                                            Orion: You certainly succeeded... *Standing up* T-That was... a good kick.                          Alex: Thanks. I wanted to make it believable.                                                       Orion: Y-You certainly succeeded.                                                                   Alex: I've gotta give it to you, that was a good plan. Fast thinking. Nice job, Orion.              Orion: Easily one of my best plans ever. I'd lie if I said I didn't enjoy every second of it. Didn't you...?                                                                                            Alex: I enjoyed... getting rid of that man so easily, yes. Even if he wasn't our man.               Orion: Awh, it wasn't him? T-Thanks. So... was he our man?                                          Alex: Nah... El Coyote is supposed to have blue eyes. And besides, I doubt he'd be trying to smuggle opium in a moment like this. He wouldn't expose himself like this.                                 Orion: Huh, you got a point. We're back to square one, I guess.                                     Alex: It seems so.                                                                                  Orion: At least I know how he's supposed to look now, though. If I find him around the–             An intense chill runs down your spine.                                                              Orion: . . .                                                                                        Alex: Are you okay...?                                                                              You turn around and spot a man with a child in the distance.                                        Orion: Did you see that...?                                                                         Alex: See what?                                                                                     Orion: A man entered that building with... a little boy. Can kids get into this server?             Alex: They probably were NPCs.                                                                      Orion: What? Are there NPCs in Blackridge?                                                          Alex: Yeah, I think so. You know how the whole goal of Eternum is to be as immersive as possible.   There are usually some NPCs scattered throughout the servers like these to prevent the worlds from  feeling empty. They can be interacted with, although they don't carry anything valuable and they    can't harm players, so most people just ignore them. In this case I think they're limited to some   ranchers between the main towns.                                                                    Orion: I see. Although... I still have a bad feeling about what I saw. Can we go check it out?      Alex: Of course. We have time.                                                                      Player: *Lighting the lantern* Ah, much better... isn't it? It's so nice to get away from the bustle of the town. *Kneeling down* Are you good now? Not too cold or too hot?                            Kid: *Nods*                                                                                         Player: Good, good... I bet that farm must be hot during summers.                                   Kid: *Nods*                                                                                         Player: Alright, a promise is a promise. Let's play a game! You must follow my instructions,        alright? Like a Simon Says game! Give me a moment to think... Turn around and touch your left ear   with a finger! *Sinister laugh* Hi-hi-hi, yes, yes! This thing is well worth its price! You can turn around. Good boy... You're such a good boy, did you know that? How old did you say you were? 9?    Kid: *Nods*                                                                                         Player: You're very clever for your age.                                                            Kid: . . .                                                                                          Player: *Sinister laugh* Okay, time for the second step of the game! I want you to–                 You punch the man with full force, propelling the man across the barn like a human projectile.      Player: *Crawling and backing off* E-Eh? What?! Who are you?!                                       Alex: W-What were you trying to do with this kid, you fucking monster...                            Orion: Don't answer that. We both know what you were going to do, and I prefer not to hear it from  your revolting mouth.                                                                               Player: T-This is not what it seems! He's not a real kid!                                           Orion: Shut the fuck up.                                                                            Player: L-Let me explain it to you! But please, don't shoot! I-It's all about... THIS!              The man reveals a small, blue box.                                                                  Alex: That thing...                                                                                 Orion: Yes... we've seen that before... (That's Linus' device... from the party. The one that       allowed him to control NPCs. And now that I look at it closer... It weirdly reminds me of the box   where Calypso was trapped when we found her too, just... smaller. I don't think this is a           coincidence. Perhaps Linus used technology stolen from Ulysses?)                                    Player: L-Let me show you what this artifact can do! If I enter the ID number of an NPC, it gets    linked to him, allowing you to control it! But if you rotate this thing again, it goes back to      normal. Look!                                                                                       Kid: *Breathing nervously* E-Eh...? W-Where am I...?                                                Alex: *Kneeling down next to the kid* Hey! Don't worry, everything's alright. *Speaking in a gentle tone* You fainted due to the sun, but we brought you here to recover. What's your name?             Jonas: Jonas.                                                                                       Alex: Do you know where you live, Jonas?                                                            Jonas: I-I do. I live near Blackridge. My father and I come to town every Saturday to deliver       vegetables and other supplies to the stores. While I was waiting for my dad, a man approached me,   and... then I don't remember what happened.                                                         Alex: That's when you came down with heat stroke! Do you want me to help you find your father?      Jonas: N-No... I know where he is.                                                                  Alex: Then you should hurry up! He must be worried about you.                                       Jonas: Yes... thank you, ma'am.                                                                     The kid rushes out of the barn and runs towards the town.                                           Orion: (Shit... this artifact has to be the thing Praetorians are looking for.) Where did you get   this thing?                                                                                         Player: What?                                                                                       Orion: I won't ask twice.                                                                           Player: I-I bought it on the black market!                                                          Orion: From who?                                                                                    Player: I don't know! Everything is done anonymously. The seller told me they had lowered costs and offered it only at 85K!                                                                             Orion: 85K...? You paid 85,000 eternals to... use it on a child?                                    Player: Oh, for fuck's sake, it's not a child! I would never do this in real life! What's Eternum   for, if we can't fulfill our darkest fantasies?! He's just a bunch of lines of code and nothing     else, don't you understand? It's not a real kid!                                                    Orion: He once was.                                                                                 Player: What the fuck are you talking about?                                                        Orion: We've talked enough.                                                                         Player: Whoa, whoa, calm down, buddy! O-Okay, I get it, what I did was wrong, I see it now! I won't do it again, there's no need to take a violent turn! Once it has been linked, the artifact cannot be used with another NPC, but... I... I can pay you! I can transfer you 500 eternals RIGHT NOW if you let me go!                                                                                          Kill him                                                                                            Player: I can wire you 500 eternals as soon as I g–                                                 Take the money and let him go                                                                       Orion: Get the fuck out of my sight before I change my mind.                                        Player: Thank you, THANK YOU!                                                                       Alex: God... That was... absolutely repulsive. I think I'll have to take a moment to collect myself in the saloon before continuing the mission. I really need to get rid of the nasty taste in my      mouth.                                                                                              Orion: Well, we already knew plenty of despicable people play this game. It's not a surprise.       Alex: I know, but... seeing it first-hand still hits you.                                           Orion: Yeah, I know what you mean.                                                                  Alex: I'm glad you killed that sick motherfucker. I know it won't change much in the real world,    but... at least he got what he deserved.                                                            Orion: Should we loot the body?                                                                     Alex: If this artifact is what the Praetorians are looking for, I wouldn't touch anything. They'll  find the corpse at one point or another, hopefully they'll see he still has all his inventory with  him, confiscate it, and leave the server.                                                           Orion: Mmh, yes, that's probably best. Do you want me to come with you to the saloon?               Alex: Nah, don't worry. We still have to find this damn Coyote guy.                                 Orion: You sure? Will you be okay?                                                                  Alex: Of course. I just need some time to compose myself.                                           Orion: Alright. Try thinking of good memories to recover the good mood. It usually helps me.        Alex: Such as?                                                                                      Orion: I don't know, the last swimming competition you won, you getting your first apartment, the   feeling of the wind while you ride your bike... That passionate kiss we had just a few minutes      ago...                                                                                              Alex: *Snorts* Mmh. Yeah, the feeling of the wind when riding my bike is definitely a great, great  suggestion. Thank you, Orion. I already feel better.                                                Orion: *Chuckles* Always happy to help. Take care, Alex. I'll come find you if I discover anything. Alex: Mm-hm. See you later, Orion...                                                                Orion: We already knew plenty of despicable people play this game. There's nothing we can do.       Alex: Well, not letting him go without a scratch would have been a start, honestly.                 Orion: What would have that changed? It's not as if we can kill or arrest him in the real world.    This way we got 500 eternals, at least.                                                             Alex: If you say so. It still turns my stomach. *Sighs* Anyway, I really need to get a drink at the saloon. See you later, Orion.                                                                       Orion: Sure. I'll come find you if I discover anything.                                             Alex: Alright...                                                                                    Orion: (Holy shit, I can't believe that just happened. If only it was me who could have touched     her... oh boy. Maybe in another life where I am born into a royal family. Ahh, a man can dream...   Sometimes it's easy to forget how many sick bastards are out there. I guess this is another big     reason to get the 10 Gems of Doom. Whatever this world is, if we really get control of it one day... many things are going to change, that's for sure. Okay, where should I go now...)                  You spend several hours scouting the town and its surroundings without luck. It's not until         nightfall that you finally arrive back in Blackridge feeling a bit disappointed.                    Orion: *Sighs* (Another dead end. I feel like I've been walking in circles all day. I hope Dalia had better luck.)                                                                                      As night falls on Frontier Trails, you make your way back to Blackridge accompanied by Roach. After giving her a carrot, you leave her at the stables.                                                  Alex: Orion! Over here!                                                                             Orion: Hmm? Ah, there you are! I was wondering if you'd still be here or not. Were you waiting for  me?                                                                                                 Alex: Hah, don't flatter yourself. We just got here a minute ago.                                   Calypso: We went to explore the cemetery, guided by tidings from a villager.                        Orion: Oh, that sounds thrilling.                                                                   Alex: Yeah, but we didn't find shit, for a change. Total waste of time. What about you? Did you have better luck?                                                                                       Orion: Nope, no dice. Dalia went outside of town to track down an old member of the gang, so let's  hope she found something useful and bailed from the server already. We did, actually. We found an   old gang member of El Coyote, a man called Boone. He mentioned knowing the locations of their hiding spots in other servers.                                                                            Alex: Huh, that does sound promising. Nice job. At least we got something.                          Orion: Dalia went with him to get the info, and she was supposed to use another Exit Portal after   that.                                                                                               Calypso: She did. I stopped feeling her presence in this realm a few minutes ago.                   Orion: Ah, good. We can ask her once we're back in the real world.                                  Alex: I guess we're all done here for today, then.                                                  Orion: I'd say we are.                                                                              Alex: Alright then, let me pick up the things I left in that alleyway and we'll be good to go.      Orion: Do you want me to wait for you?                                                              Alex: Of course I do. Do you think I'll let you log off in my apartment while I'm still playing? No chance.                                                                                             Orion: *Chuckles* Ah true, I forgot. My bad.                                                        Alex: Sure, if you really want to...                                                                Orion: I'll be right here! Well, thank you for your assistance, Princess.                           Calypso: I am glad to have been of help.                                                            Orion: I hope you enjoyed your... second bath.                                                      Calypso: I very much did, thank you.                                                                Orion: Are you going back to Ekabar now?                                                            Calypso: I will. After seeing firsthand how useful asking the locals can be, I will resume my search of Hyril'ar. Hopefully with better results this time.                                              Orion: I wish you the best of luck.                                                                 Calypso: If you need me from now on, you know where to find me.                                     Orion: I do. Have a good night, Princess.                                                           Calypso: Farewell... Orion.                                                                         Orion: Farewell... *Taking a deep breath* Aah... (Damn, this was an intense day. I had even more fun than what I expected when I first logged in. A lot more... Especially in the morning...)           . . .                                                                                               Orion: (How many hours have we been playing on this server? I totally lost track of time. I think   the craziest thing is how unaware we are of what's happening in the real world. World War III could have started and we wouldn't even know.)                                                            . . .                                                                                               Orion: *Turning around* (She's taking her time.) Alex? Do you need me to help you with anything?    . . .                                                                                               Orion: Alex...?                                                                                     You step into the alley where Alex disappeared just to find nothing except for some players in the  distance.                                                                                           Orion: (Where the hell did she go? Maybe there's another Exit Portal in the town? This is weird...) ???: And you must be the leader...                                                                  You slowly turn around.                                                                             Orion: Who the fuck– (Wait, this man...)                                                            El Coyote: Well, here I am. You've been looking for me all day long, haven't you, boy? I'll admit   that I'm flattered, but I usually prefer to stay in the shadows.                                    Orion: (They have Alex...)                                                                          El Coyote: Don't you?                                                                               Orion: Let her go.                                                                                  El Coyote: *Laughs* Who, your girl? Don't worry, Billy won't touch her unless you force us to.      Right, Billy?                                                                                       Billy: Of course not. We'd never harm a pretty girl like this for no reason. It'd be such a shame.  If you force us to act, though... we might have to kill her too. Unless she wants to have a couple  of drinks with us at the saloon. I saw you two kissing each other by the mines this afternoon, and  I've gotta say, she looks like a passionate woman.                                                  Alex: Just try it and I'll rip your tongue out.                                                     Billy: *Laughs* You got yourself a feisty girl! Just how I like them...                             Alex: I'm not his girl.                                                                             Billy: Uhh... she sounds pissed off!                                                                El Coyote: Tell me, then... How did you find out I have a Gem of Doom?                              Orion: What...?                                                                                     El Coyote: *Sighs* Oh, come on... Let's just skip this part, shall we? I know you've been trying to locate me because of the Gem I own. Why would you, if not? You're not even regulars in Frontier     Trails. So tell me, who do you work with?                                                           Orion: Let the girl go. I won't ask again.                                                          El Coyote: *Laughs* You got some balls, my young friend. You learned about my Gem... and came right after me. I respect that. But I'm sorry, you need more than courage and brute force to gather the 10 Gems of Doom. That's why solo players will never be able to complete the quest. Not even Thanatos. You need intelligence. Charisma. Strategy. And loyal allies.                                        Orion: That sounds like something a weak person would say.                                          El Coyote: *Chuckles* You remind me of myself when I was younger. So eager to prove my worth, to    make my mark on the world. I've got an idea for you. A duel. The most honorable of combat.          Orion: A duel...?                                                                                   El Coyote: You and me. Right here. Right now. Accept it... and if you come find me after the 24-hour penalty, I might even consider allowing you to join our group.                                     Alex: Be careful, Orion. People in Blackridge have been talking about his infamous reputation for   eliminating countless opponents in duels. He's definitely hiding something.                         Billy: That's the neat part! There's no trick, no secret advantage involved. The boss is simply     unbeatable in a duel. He possesses the absolute fastest draw in all of Eternum!                     You slowly move your hand towards your revolver and assume a dueling stance.                        El Coyote: Ah, so you've chosen to meet your end with honor! Just because of that, we won't touch   your girl. Just because of that, we won't touch the girl.                                           Orion: *Taking a deep, slow breath* No, you won't.                                                  El Coyote: Can you do the honors, Billy?                                                            Billy: You shoot on my count, or when you see your opponent reaching for his gun!                   El Coyote: It's nothing personal, kid. You see, when you carry a name like mine, you occasionally   need to deal with nuisances. You just happened to be... the inconvenience of the week.              Billy: Get ready! Three... Two... One... Eh...? W-What...? What the fuck happened? Where did they–  AAAARGH!!! *Wheezing* W-WHAT THE HELL?!                                                             Orion: As a fan of big speeches myself, I must admit that your boss delivered a pretty good one. He was correct. Acquiring all the Gems of Doom definitely requires more than just strength.            Billy: *Wheezing* E-Eeehh?!                                                                         Orion: You also need intelligence, strategic thinking, and a loyal team. But... he got one thing    wrong... I am much more than just the inconvenience of the week.                                    Billy: *Wheezing* W-What the fuck are you?!                                                         Orion: The Gem. Where is it?                                                                        Billy: *Wheezing* It's not here! He never carries it around!                                        Orion: Where is it hidden, then?                                                                    Billy: *Wheezing* It must be somewhere in one of our bases! *Wheezing* W-We have one in The New     World and... in Ion, I think?!                                                                      Orion: Be more specific.                                                                            Billy: *Wheezing* I-I don't know! I've never been to the one in Ion, and our base in The New World  is a ship! *Wheezing* I-It's always moving around! I d-don't know, I swear!                         Orion: . . . How many of you are out there?                                                         Billy: *Wheezing* In total? M-Maybe like... 50 people? Perhaps a bit more. *Wheezing* W-We're a     small group.                                                                                        Orion: (Nothing like the WRE or Wagner's group, then. Ironic as it sounds, that might complicate    things.)                                                                                            Billy: *Wheezing* W-Who the hell are you?! *Wheezing* How can you use magic on a non-magical server?Orion: . . . I am... Nobody.                                                                        Billy: *Wheezing* Uhh??                                                                             Orion: Go and find your group, and tell them that... Nobody killed your boss. And when Coyote gets  access to Eternum again after his 24-hour nap... tell him that I'm coming for him and his Gem.      Billy: I-I will! I will tell them!                                                                  Orion: Good.                                                                                        You let Billy go and he flees like a bat out of hell.                                               Orion: (The New World... Hmph. Looks like I'll have to get myself a pirate hat soon.) Well... No one was hurt, and we now know they have 2 bases in other servers. I'd call our mission today... a      moderate success.                                                                                   Alex: Mm-hm.                                                                                        Orion: Don't worry, you don't have to say anything. I know you loved how epically I rescued you with my super speed.                                                                                    Alex: Nobody? What was that about?                                                                  Orion: Do you like it? I'm trying to get myself a name out there. A nickname makes it more catchy,  like “Thanatos”, or “El Coyote”.                                                                    Alex: Meh, I've heard better.                                                                       Orion: Nickname or not... you've gotta admit that you loved how epically I rescued you with my super speed.                                                                                             Alex: I had the situation under control.                                                            Orion: *Laughs* Excuse me? No, you didn't! Come on, just a thank you will do.                       Alex: I didn't know you could control your powers so well, I'll give you that. You can even speak   now! Quite an improvement from the mindless berserk state you used to transform into.               Orion: Not even a simple “thank you for saving me, Orion!”? “That was so badass, Orion!”            Alex: *Snorts* Hmph. Thank you for rescuing me from those villainous villains with your super       strength, Orion! I feel incredibly protected by your side! You're my hero, my knight in shining     armor! THANK YOU!                                                                                   Orion: *Laughs* Ah, now THAT'S better! And you're very welcome, m'lady. I'd risk my life everyday   for you.                                                                                            Alex: *Chuckles* Alright, now that you've had your ego boost... can we finally leave? Nah... not    feeling like it.                                                                                    Orion: You're evil...                                                                               Alex: Can we leave now? I'm honestly exhausted.                                                     Orion: Definitely, I'm so tired too. As much as I love Eternum, I need some time lying on a floppy  couch.                                                                                              Alex: Next time we play, let's pick a server where we can just relax on a pool with some cocktails. Orion: *Laughs* Count me in.                                                                        Alex: Oof...                                                                                        Orion: Arghhhh... D-Do you feel that too?                                                           Alex: If you mean feel as if I had just been beaten the hell up... then yes, I do.                  Orion: Every single muscle and bone in my body aches. Why?? We've been literally sitting on this    couch the entire day.                                                                               Alex: I don't know... something to do with how our brains process our experiences, they say.        Orion: Sometimes I wish Eternum wasn't so immersive...                                              Alex: My feet are killing me.                                                                       Orion: My thighs are sore from riding a horse for so long.                                          Alex: I need to go to the bathroom so badly.                                                        Orion: And I'm starving...                                                                          Alex: God, I'm sooo hungry too...                                                                   Orion: Well, at least your cold seems a lot better!                                                 Alex: Hmm...? *Sniffs* Hey, it's true! My nose is finally clear! And I feel a lot better in that    regard!                                                                                             Orion: I told you, Dr. Eggdogstein can work wonders on any cold.                                    Alex: *Laughs* Well, maybe it's also thanks to the drugs I took, don't you think?                   Orion: *Chuckles* Hey, I brought those too, so I'll take credit for it as well.                     Alex: Damn, thanks, Orion. Those remedies really did wonders. I think that after taking a shower,   I'll feel as good as new.                                                                           Orion: I'm sure of it. Just let me use the toilet for a second before leaving and I'll let y– Holy  shit, it's still storming out there. It's raining even more than when I arrived. . . . Um...        Alex: *Standing up* Nooooope.                                                                       Orion: What? I didn't say anything yet!                                                             Alex: I know what you're gonna ask.                                                                 Orion: It's not what you think.                                                                     Alex: Hmm... Okay, humor me then.                                                                   Can I stay over?                                                                                    Orion: Can I stay over?                                                                             Alex: That's EXACTLY what I thought you were going to ask!                                          You look so pretty tonight                                                                          Orion: I just wanted to say how extraordinarily pretty you look tonight. Even though you’re under   the weather, you still manage to–                                                                   Alex: Cut the shit. Is that all?                                                                    Orion: Um... No, I also wanted to ask... Could I... perhaps... Stay over? Just today!               Alex: I KNEW IT!                                                                                    I loved playing with you                                                                            Orion: I just wanted to say how cool it was to play with you today. I know we saw some fucked up    shit today, but... it's awesome how you always manage to light up the room. Thanks for playing with me. I love spending time with you.                                                                  Alex: Oh... huh. You're welcome. I mean... it's nothing. I didn't do anything. It's me who's        thankful for... Your uhh... *Grumbling* I'm not good at this shit.                                  Orion: *Chuckles* Don't worry, I understand.                                                        Alex: I just wanted to say that... yeah, thank you for playing with me too. I like it. Being with   you, I mean. Playing. . . . *Clears throat* Anyway, let's not get all sappy like a bunch of drama   nerds. Was that all?                                                                                Orion: Pretty much! Oh, and one last thing I wanted to ask... Could I... perhaps... *Clears throat* You know, since it's still raining so much... Stay over? Just today!                                Alex: AHA! I KNEW IT! And no, you can't.                                                            Orion: Come on, please! It's pouring down outside! And considering how late it is, there's a good   chance there aren't any more buses running at this hour!                                            Alex: *Grumbling* Mmmhh... *Sighs* Okay, FINE. I don't want to have to explain to everyone how you  mysteriously disappeared after I kicked you out and you got involved in some unfortunate incident.  Orion: I-Is that something that happens often in this neighborhood or something...?                 Alex: You can stay. But just this once! This isn't a hotel!                                         Orion: Yay!                                                                                         Alex: So don’t go expecting five-star amenities!                                                    Orion: No way!                                                                                      Alex: And you can't complain about anything!                                                        Orion: Okay!                                                                                        Alex: Not a word about the kitchen! It’s a disaster in there.                                       Orion: I couldn't care less! I'll whip up something to eat!                                         Alex: All I have is a bag of chips. I was gonna go grocery shopping tomorrow.                       Orion: No problemo, chips and a couple of cold ones it is, then!                                    Alex: I don't have beer. Just tap water.                                                            Orion: Did I say beer? I meant we're ordering pizza! My treat!                                      Alex: . . .                                                                                         Orion: Chinese food...?                                                                             Alex: *Snorts* Hmph. It's impossible to bring your mood down, eh?                                   Orion: That's my secret. Gotta always stay positive.                                                Alex: *Chuckles* Alright, alright... let's order pizza. But we're splitting the bill.               Orion: Deal!                                                                                        Alex: I'll go take a quick shower. Order me a pepperoni one. Extra cheese.                          Orion: Ah, a woman of good taste, I see! Do you want some chicken wings too?                        Alex: Sure, why the hell not. I like honey BBQ and lemon pepper!                                    Orion: Right away!                                                                                  You both freshen up, devour two pizzas, and relax on Alex's cozy sofa. You both sit lazily as you   watch a live stream of the national swimming Olympic qualifiers on her laptop.                      Alex: Huh! Hayes didn't qualify? You've got to be kidding me. I guess that's what happens when      you're too overconfident.                                                                           Orion: (Who would have imagined just a few months ago that I'd be having dinner with Alexandra      Bardot... in her own home! It already seemed improbable after our intial frosty encounter. But after discovering she was Axel's sister and the daughter of Ulysses' biggest shareholder, it felt like an impossibility. And yet... here we are. A girl who could have all the luxuries in the world... but  instead chose to struggle to make it on her own in a scary apartment building, eating a $10 pizza   for dinner. She truly is something else.)                                                           Alex: W-Why are you staring at me like that? Am I wearing a pepperoni on my face or something?      Orion: U-Um... no! I was just... a little lost in thought. About my things.                         Alex: I know these qualifiers are boring as fuck to everyone who doesn't swim. I just wanted to see the finals, so we can turn it off now.                                                              Orion: Nah, it wasn’t boring at all. They were pretty entertaining. Is that something you ever want to do? Go to the Olympics?                                                                          Alex: Uh... I don't know, my coach keeps telling me that I could, but... I'm not sure. Maybe next   year. We'll see.                                                                                    Orion: Well, if you ever go... you have your number one fan right here!                             Alex: Hmph.                                                                                         About the girls...                                                                                  Orion: Have any of the girls written back in the group chat? I'd check it myself, but my phone just died.                                                                                               Alex: *Taking her phone out* Um, let me see... Yeah, apparently Dalia has info about El Coyote's    hiding spots. Something about a man called... Boone, and some maps?                                 Orion: Yeah! That's the guy we found at the cabin in the middle of nowhere! No idea. But I guess    he's the man she found at that cabin in Frontier Trails. Good to hear we have a lead to follow.     Alex: And now we're discussing who'll go to The New World to try to find El Coyote's base.          Orion: That's the pirate server, right?! I wanna go! Tell them to count on me!                      Alex: Okay, okay, I'm telling them.                                                                 Orion: We have to find this Gem before Thanatos does... Now it's personal.                          Alex: And... alright, that's pretty much it for now. *Snorts* Hmph.                                 Alex puts her phone down as she chuckles.                                                           Orion: What's so funny?                                                                             Alex: Nothing, nothing.                                                                             Orion: Come on, I wanna laugh too!                                                                  Alex: It's nothing, Dalia just sent a meme. It's nothing, they just sent a meme.                    Orion: About what? It was about me, wasn't it?                                                      Alex: *Chuckles* Perhaps.                                                                           Orion: Show it to me!                                                                               Alex: Nah! You'll see it when you charge your phone.                                                Orion: You're evil...                                                                               About those Praetorians...                                                                          Orion: Oh, I forgot to ask earlier... what happened with the Praetorians in Blackridge? I didn't see them when I came back from the cabin. I stopped seeing them at a certain point.                    Alex: I think they all left the town a couple of hours before our incident with El Coyote.          Actually... I believe I know what they were doing in the server.                                    Orion: Really?                                                                                      Alex: Do you remember the artifact that Linus showed us at the Ulysses dinner? I stumbled upon a man carrying one of those, shortly after we parted ways.                                               Orion: Damn, I do remember.                                                                         Alex: I started asking questions, but the guy panicked and ran away, leaving the box behind.        Orion: Huh. Yes, that's definitely what the Praetorians were looking for. Did you take it?          Alex: Nah, I preferred not to mess with that shit.                                                  Orion: Smart decision.                                                                              Alex: I assume they eventually found the artifact and left afterwards.                              Orion: Mmh, yeah, probably. That damn artifact, though... It could definitely be useful. I mean,    imagine if we were able to recruit a Praetorian for our cause. And not only to fight. Just think    about the things she could tell us! About Idriel, or... the Founder.                                Alex: Yeah, definitely. Although... unless you have $100K lying around and a good black-market      contact... I'm not sure how we're getting our hands on one of those.                                Orion: Yeah, fair enough. Although... you never know. I'd say it's something to keep in mind...     About your brother...                                                                               Orion: Ah, did I tell you I ran into your brother earlier today?                                    Alex: Axel? For real? What's he up to now? He hasn't been to school in a while.                     Orion: He looked pretty rough, not gonna lie. And he sounded a bit... paranoid, honestly, but       apparently he's been investigating your father.                                                     Alex: Seriously? Axel going against our beloved saint of a father? I find that hard to believe.     Orion: At least that's what he told me. Oh, and he asked me about you too.                          Alex: Axel? Really...?                                                                              Orion: Yeah, right before he left. He wanted to know how you've been doing.                         Alex: Hmph.                                                                                         Orion: Have you seen either of them lately?                                                         Alex: Nah, even before moving here, I barely set foot in that house. Mom knew that I was leaving,   and... Axel probably did too. But my father didn't even notice, I'm sure of it. I literally haven't seen him in weeks.                                                                                  Orion: Damn, I'm sorry, Alex. I know it must not be easy.                                           Alex: Don't be sorry. Honestly? I couldn't be happier about it. I finally have my own place, and I  have everything I need in life right now. So... screw the Bardot family.                            Orion: That's right! You have us now. And hey, if you're looking for a husband to finally get rid of that last name once and for all, I offer my services. Alexandra Richards has a nice ring to it.    Alex: *Chuckles* Thanks for the offer. I'll keep it in mind.                                        Go to sleep                                                                                         Orion: Welp, I guess it's time to sleep.                                                            Alex: Oh... already?                                                                                Orion: Aren't you tired?                                                                            Alex: I mean... yeah, I guess I should get some rest. Now that I remember, I have swim practice     tomorrow at eight. Which means that YOU have to get out of here before 7:30 AM too.                 Orion: Awh, can't I hold down the fort here and stay in your cozy home?                             Alex: No chance.                                                                                    Orion: *Laughs* I imagined so. Thanks again for letting me stay here, Alex. It really means a lot.  You're a good friend.                                                                               Alex: . . . ...yeah. You're... a good friend too, Orion.                                            Orion: *Chuckles* Who would have imagined we'd become buddies, eh?                                  Alex: ...yeah. Anyway, I'll let you sleep. Remember we... Have to wake up at 7 tomorrow. There      should be buses already running at that hour.                                                       Orion: Alright, sounds good! Sleep well, Alex.                                                      Alex: Yeah... you too. Good night, Orion.                                                           Orion: *Yawns* Damn, this was a looong day... *Lying down on the couch* (I can't even keep my eyes  open... Hmm, this apartment sure is warm. I don't even need a blanket. That will come in handy now  that winter is coming.) *Yawns* (Summer, though... That'll be another... Matter...)                 Someone knocks on the door.                                                                         Orion: Mmh...                                                                                       . . .                                                                                               Orion: Mmmmh? *Waking up* U-Uh...?                                                                  Alex: Yeah, yeah, I'm coming! Jeez...                                                               Orion: *Still half-asleep* Who is it?                                                               Alex: Must be that darn neighbor again...                                                           Orion: Really? What time is it...?                                                                  Alex: 3:10 AM. Don't worry, I'll open. Just go back to sleep.                                       Orion: *Lying down on the couch again* Jesus Christ, what the fuck is wrong with this guy... *Yawns* Now I can't sleep anymore. Even though I've only slept for about... 2 hours. Dammit. . . . He      better have a damn good reason for bothering you at 3 in the fucking morning, I tell you. . . .     *Stretching out* Mmmhh... what time is it, by the way?                                              Alex: Um... it's about ten minutes to 1 AM.                                                         Orion: Damn, way later than I thought.                                                              Alex: And... oof, according to the forecast, the rain will continue all night long. If only we could open the windows, it would be a lot cooler in here. But I don't wanna get everything wet.          Orion: Yeah, this apartment does feel quite warm, true.                                             Alex: It is. They told me it's because of the insulating material of the walls, or something like   that. Which is great now that winter is coming, but in the summer... probably not so much.          Orion: Don't worry, by the time next summer arrives, we'll have already collected the 10 Gems of    Doom and be living in our Beverly Hills mansions.                                                   Alex: *Chuckles* I'll take your word for it. Becoming my father's boss is something I'd really like to do in this life.                                                                                 Orion: *Chuckles* I can imagine.                                                                    Alex: But anyway, you aren’t quite in your Beverly Hills castle just yet, so you'll have to settle  for crashing on a thrift store sofa.                                                                Orion: Won't complain. I could sleep on the floor if I had to.                                      Alex: Feel free to sleep in your underwear if it gets too stuffy in here.                           Orion: *Taking off your shirt* Oh, you don't have to tell me twice! Thanks. You know... you can do  the same. It's your home after all. I wouldn't mind, really.                                        Alex: *Snorts* I bet you wouldn't.                                                                  Orion: Purely for the sake of tolerating the heat, of course. We can't open the windows, so...      Alex: Wait, now that you mention it...                                                              Alex sits up with a sudden jump, and her shirt lifts above her waist.                               Orion: (Oh Lord...)                                                                                 Alex: I think there's a window in the kitchen we could open. It doesn't face the street and is under a little overhang, so it shouldn’t let much rain in. Hopefully that’ll help get some cool air in.  Orion: G-Good...                                                                                    Alex: *Heading to the kitchen* Give me a second.                                                    Orion: Sure... *Lying down on the couch* (Oh man... Every time I catch a glimpse of Alex's skin, all my exhaustion seems to vanish into thin air. I wonder if she knows the effect she has on me. I     mean, she has to know. Alex is anything but dumb, and I'm not exactly the most subtle person...)    *Sighs* (Too bad she probably–)                                                                     A shirt is tossed over your face as Alex comes back to the living room.                             Alex: Mission failed, I can't open the window.                                                      Orion: Really? *Taking the shirt off your face* How... ...come?                                     Alex: The handle is stuck on something. Another thing to add to the never-ending list of repairs    needed in this apartment... *Jumping on the couch* So I guess we'll have to go with plan B. You     said... you don't mind, right?                                                                      Orion: Not... Not at all.                                                                           Alex: You okay?                                                                                     Orion: Y-Yeah.                                                                                      Alex: What's with that stammering? Did you really get shy all of a sudden? After how much we've     already seen of each other?                                                                         Orion: C-Certainly not! It's just that... I was expecting you to wear a bra under that shirt.       Alex: A bra? Why would I? I'm in my own home. Wearing just an oversized T-shirt is the best thing in the world. And being able to take it off at night? Even better!                                    Orion: So you've been sleeping naked, huh? Aren't you afraid of some nosy neighbor catching a       glimpse?                                                                                            Alex: Nah... the closest building is still too far away. And even then, the only apartment from     where they could see us is where an old couple lives.                                               Orion: I see...                                                                                     Alex: Anyway... goodnight, Orion. I'm off to sleep on my “king-sized mattress”... you have fun out  here. Sorry I don't have anything better to offer.                                                  Orion: It's okay... don't worry.                                                                    Alex: Before going to sleep, though, I just wanted to say... Look, I know I'm not the most          expressive girl in the world. But... I still have emotions deep down. I’m not a cold-hearted tin-man like most would think! And today, you made me feel... um... I guess I just want you to know that... I really appreciate everything you did. Even if sometimes I make it seem like I couldn’t be        bothered. I mean... coming here to take care of me, and bringing me all the medicine. It... it      really meant a lot. So thank you, Orion. You've become... very special to me.                       Orion: You're... welcome...                                                                         Alex: Did you even listen to a word I just said? Because it looked like you were staring at my tits the whole time.                                                                                     Orion: Uh... Something about... special medicine?                                                   Alex: So I open up my soul to you and you don't even pay attention?                                 Orion: Come on! You can't expect me to focus after showing up like that! I'm still in shock.        Alex: *Snorts* I see... Well, I'll let you be, then. Rest well!                                     Orion: Aren’t you going to kiss me goodnight before you go?                                         Alex: A goodnight kiss?                                                                             Orion: The one we had in Blackridge really left me hungry for another. I'm not sure I'll be able to fall asleep without one.                                                                            Alex: I'm sorry, I might have no symptoms at the moment thanks to your meds, but I'm still sick. I'd just pass on the cold to you. And with how whiney you could be, I wouldn’t want to hear about it.  Plus, you’re our main offensive weapon in Eternum, and the one who's carrying the Gems. We need you at full capacity.                                                                                   Orion: Well... as long as I stay away from your airways, I should be good.                          Alex: *Chuckles* Ah, yeah, a flawless plan. You know my “airways” are required in a kiss, right?    Orion: Well then, we can always find... other goodnight rituals that don't involve them... Something that keeps our mouths away from each other.                                                        Alex: Oh, really? Such as?                                                                          Caress her                                                                                          Orion: Well... I could kiss you... but maybe a little further south...                              Alex: Ah, yes, “further south”. There’s so many places that are further down. Where did you have in mind, exactly...?                                                                                   Orion: Hmm, let me think...                                                                         Feeling emboldened by Alex's playful demeanor, you stand up while pulling her closer and nestling   her between the cushions.                                                                           Orion: Well... I certainly have a couple spots in mind.                                             Alex: Do you now? Now the suspense is killing me. I’m very curious where this mystery leads...      Orion: *Chuckles* You can probably imagine.                                                         Alex: Who, me? I'm just a sweet and innocent princess, I can't possibly imagine what you have in    that dirty mind of yours. Maybe I need someone bad like you to enlighten me...                      Orion: Well... I thought I could kiss your toes...                                                  Alex: Mm-hm... warm...                                                                              Orion: Then your thighs...                                                                          Alex: Ah, getting warmer...                                                                         Orion: And then...                                                                                  Alex: Yes...?                                                                                       Orion: *Kneeling between her legs* Better yet, why don’t I just demonstrate for you...              Alex: Burning hot...                                                                                You caress Alex's intimate parts through her underwear. She doesn't recoil or shy away, although you can hear her breaths quickening at the feel of your touch. You gently move the delicate fabric of  her panties to the side, revealing the smooth contours of her perfectly shaved pussy.               Orion: (Oh sweet Lord...)                                                                           Without waiting a second longer, you shove your head in between Alex's firm thighs and spread her   velvety lips with your tongue.                                                                      Alex: *Letting out a suppressed moan* MMMmmmh...                                                    Orion: Can I continue, then...?                                                                     Alex: Mm-hm...                                                                                      Upon noticing Alex's inviting response, you tightly grab her legs and start eating her out.         Alex: O-Ooh.... FUCK, Orion...                                                                      Orion: (God, I love her taste... Her scent... I love everything about her...)                       Alex: *Gasping* AAAaaahh...                                                                         Orion: (Now that I think about it, I have never heard Alex moaning before. It sounds so unlike her, but incredibly hot at the same time...)                                                             Alex: AAAahhh s-shit... *Moaning* F-Fuck, this feels so good...                                     Orion: (This is definitely a side of her that I’ve never seen before.)                              Alex: P-Please keep doing what you're doing...                                                      Your eyes wander from Alex's pussy to her athletic body, taking joy in each one of her involuntary  squirms and reactions.                                                                              Alex: Aaahh... T-This is definitely... T-The best “goodnight kiss” I've ever gotten... AAaahhhh...  F-Fuck, Orion...                                                                                    Orion: Mmmm...                                                                                      Alex abruptly pushes you to the side and stands up.                                                 Orion: W-What happened? Was something wrong...?                                                     She kneels down between your legs without saying a word.                                            Orion: Okay, I like where this is going... Oh fuck yes...                                           Alex stares mesmerized at your junk for a few seconds before pulling your pants down completely.    Alex: I bet you feel better now.                                                                    Orion: Definitely...                                                                                Alex: I almost could feel your pants about to burst while you were going down on me. And looks like I wasn't wrong. *Standing up again* You were ready for battle down there, huh?                      Orion: I can't help it... that's the effect you have on me.                                         Alex: Now... before you continue what you were doing... I thought I could give you a hand too.      Orion: That sounds damn good to me...                                                               Alex: I mean, you're my guest after all. I wouldn't want you to feel uncomfortable, or to make you  do all the work. What would people say of me, right?                                                Orion: I surely wouldn't want you to be known as a bad hostess...                                   Ask her to caress you                                                                               Orion: Well... you could kiss me on... some other part.                                             Alex: *Getting comfortable between the cushions* Another part, huh...? Such as...?                  Orion: Surprise me.                                                                                 Alex: No, no, it was your idea! Did you have something in mind?                                     Orion: *Chuckles* You can probably guess.                                                           Alex: Who, me? I'm just a sweet and innocent princess, I couldn’t possibly imagine what you have in that dirty mind of yours. Please, enlighten me...                                                   Orion: *Chuckles* Well... You could kiss me on my chest, for example.                               Alex: Mm-hm.                                                                                        Orion: Then my stomach...                                                                           Alex: Hmmmph...                                                                                     Orion: Then you could take off my pants, and...                                                     Alex: *Gasps* Hold on there! You nasty pervert!                                                     Orion: It's you who asked me what was on my mind.                                                   Alex: Yes, but I thought you were a gentleman, not a perv. I invite you to my own home, I let you   stay under my roof, eat my chips, and this is how you behave yourself? No kiss for you. Sick or not, you don't deserve my lips, Orion...                                                                Orion: Awh, really? And what about your hands?                                                      Alex: *Gasps* Gross! Definitely not that either. You should be grateful for just getting my foot.   Orion: Well, depending on where I am getting it... I'd definitely accept that. Although... I'd need to get a little more comfortable for that.                                                          Alex: Oh, is that so? Don't let me stop you, then... Feel free to get more comfortable, if you want.Orion: Can I take my pants off?                                                                     Alex: Of course, do what you wish. Make yourself at home.                                           Orion: Ah, thank goodness. You have no idea how much I appreciate that. The warmth was starting to  become unbearable.                                                                                  You pull your pants down, exposing your already-fully-erect member.                                 Alex: *Mumbling* Jesus... *Touching your dick with her toes* What the hell is that, Orion...?       Orion: (Oh, fuck yes...) W-What do you mean?                                                        Alex: I mean the fact that a third of your blood is currently concentrated in your dong. You sure   were ready for battle down there.                                                                   Orion: I can't help it, it's the effect you have on me.                                             Alex: Really? Just because of seeing my boobs?                                                      Orion: Your naked body, your constant teasing... It’s all of you, Alex.                             Alex: Ah, I see...                                                                                  Alex spreads her legs and puts her feet around your hard cock.                                      Orion: *Clenching your fist* Oh yes...                                                              Alex: Perv...                                                                                       Orion: Oh, f-fuck...                                                                                Alex quickly sets a pace, gently jacking you off with her warm and surprisingly skilled feet.       Orion: Oh YES... God... You're good at this...                                                      Alex: Thank you.                                                                                    Orion: Aaahh... I-I've gotta say... This is definitely the best “goodnight kiss” I've ever gotten...Alex: *Giggles* I bet. You're hard as fuck.                                                         Orion: F-Fuck, how could I not...                                                                   Your eyes wander from Alex's feet to her athletic body, captivated by the subtle transformation of  her expression, which seems to grow more lustful with each passing moment.                          Orion: Aaaah...                                                                                     Alex: *Giggles* Mmh.                                                                                Orion: You're enjoying this, aren't you?                                                            Alex: *Giggles* Probably not as much as you...                                                      Orion: *Chuckles* P-Probably not...                                                                 Alex abruptly stops the footjob and stands up, positioning herself in front of you.                 Orion: W-What happened...?                                                                          Alex: Before we continue... Let me get rid of this for you...                                       She kneels down between your legs and stares mesmerized at your junk for a few seconds before       pulling your pants down.                                                                            Alex: You know... I might have been too harsh before... So... Okay. I'll let you... have my hands. I guess you've earned it after all you've done today.                                                Orion: Oh man...                                                                                    Alex: So... Can I... grab it...?                                                                    Orion: O-Of course...                                                                               Alex straddles you and firmly wraps her small hands around your dick.                               Orion: O-O-Oh, fuck yes... *Caressing her thigh* I guess you do have some five-star amenities after all...                                                                                              Alex: *Giggles* Well... As long as our... airways... stay away from each other... We should be      good... right? I wouldn't want the girls to get mad at me because I got you sick.                   Orion: Definitely...                                                                                Alex starts to jack you off in a teasingly slow manner, as your cock gets unbelievably hard.        Orion: Oh Jesus, t-that feels good...                                                               Alex: Mm-hm...                                                                                      Orion: Aaahh...                                                                                     Alex: *Soft moan* Why do I feel like you’re even stiffer than that day in Eternum, Orion... This    thing is pulsating so much, as if it were about to explode.                                         Orion: F-Fuck, Alex, you're driving me insane... Don't you wanna switch now? I need to edge off a   bit... And... I could give you a hand too... Don't you wanna switch again? I need to edge off a     bit...                                                                                              Alex: Nah-ah. You aren’t going anywhere. *Giggles* Teasing you is even more enjoyable...            Orion: Aaahh... F-Fuck... seeing it right in front of you like this... I can't stop imagining how it would feel to stuff my cock inside your petite body... do you see how deep inside you it’d go...?  Alex: *Scoffs* What do you mean, petite? I'm not petite. Any woman would look small next to your    ginormous junk.                                                                                     Orion: Nah... you are. It's just that your attitude gives you a strong presence, making you seem... larger.                                                                                             Alex: *Chuckles* Bullshit.                                                                          Orion: How tall are you?                                                                            Alex: 5'4''.                                                                                        Orion: So, same as Nova...                                                                          Alex: *Giggles* I'm taller than Nova.                                                               Orion: You're my little petite princess...                                                          Alex: *Giggles* Shut the fuck up.                                                                   As the teasing continues, the anticipation starts to intensify to unbearable levels, blurring the   border between pleasure and pain.                                                                   Orion: *Panting* F-Fuck, Alex... I... I can't bear this anymore.                                    Alex: *Soft voice* Do you want me to go faster...?                                                  Orion: I want to fuck you... I need to... Aren't you horny too?                                     Alex: . . . Would it go to your head if I said yes...?                                              Orion: Then... If we both want it, why don’t...                                                     Alex: . . .                                                                                         Alex stands up and grabs the side seams of her panties. She pulls them down to her thighs and lets  them drop to the floor.                                                                             Orion: (No. It's impossible. I’m dreaming, right?)                                                  You slowly raise your gaze to Alex's face, afraid that uttering a single word could change the      course of what you think is about to happen.                                                        Alex: *Breathing very quickly* . . . . Okay, I'm about to say something that I'll probably regret   deeply tomorrow morning. Or... probably regret before the night is over.                            Orion: Oh god.                                                                                      Alex: Q-Quiet. D-Don't utter a single word or you'll make me change my mind. Do you understand?     You nod intensely, feeling your heartbeat skyrocket to worrying levels.                             Alex: *Breathing very quickly* . . . . Yes, I'm horny as fuck. So... *Breathing very quickly* . . . . I'm going to let you put it in.                                                                   Orion: (OH GOD.)                                                                                    Alex: But JUST the tip. And only for... like... two minutes. Three minutes, tops. If you can last   that long. Those are the two simple rules you have to follow, or else this thing is over. A-Are we  clear?                                                                                              Orion: Just the tip, and three minutes tops...                                                      Alex: Good. *Breathing very quickly* . . . .                                                        Alex gets on the couch and straddles you, getting into position.                                    Orion: Oh my fucking god, Alex...                                                                   Alex: *Bitting her lip* Are you ready?                                                              Orion: No man can be ready for this...                                                              Alex lets out a loud moan as she mounts the tip of your cock and it slides slowly into her warm     embrace.                                                                                            Alex: *Moaning* F-Fuck...                                                                           Orion: OH MY GOD...                                                                                 Alex: *Letting her body sink into you* F-FUUUCK... *Panting* Aargh.... aaaahh... aaaahhh... Oh m-my g-gooood...                                                                                         Orion: Jesus Christ, Alex...                                                                        Alex: *Moaning* Yeah... T-This is... J-Just what I needed...                                        Orion: Oh babe... (It happened. I'M FINALLY INSIDE OF ALEX. I'M FUCKING HER. And she's even tighter than I imagined, good lord...)                                                                      Alex: F-Fuck, Orion, h-how can this just be the tip... It's... too big...                           Orion: Does it hurt?                                                                                Alex: H-Hurt? F-Fuck no... it feels AMAZING...                                                      Alex continues to ride you in ecstasy. You feel her tight pussy gradually accommodate your size more and more with each thrust, as if her young, athletic body was begging for more.                    Alex: *Moaning* Mmmmm... F-Fuck yes...                                                              Orion: Oh good lord...                                                                              Alex: *Giggles* MMmmmmMmm...                                                                        Orion: Oh my, Alex...                                                                               Alex: You know... W-We've already exceeded the three-minute mark, Orion...                          Orion: P-Please, don't get off me... Let me stay inside you forever...                              Alex: I... AAAaahh... I certainly don't want to stop... *Moaning* Mmmmmhh... I... c-can't stop... I wonder if... for that matter... Since we already broke one of the two rules... maybe we should break the other one as well...                                                                           Orion: W-What?                                                                                      Alex: *Panting* I-I think I can take it deeper. I want to see if I can take... ALL OF YOU... inside of me... I wanna know how it feels...                                                               Orion: (Oh Jesus...)                                                                                You grab on tight to the blanket under you and look at the ceiling, trying not to cum too fast and  end this ethereal dream.                                                                            Alex: *Whispering* So tell me... *Whispering* Are you ready now... *Whispering* For the ride of your life, cowboy...?                                                                                   Orion: Lord give me strength...                                                                     Alex: AAAAAaAaaAaaaAAAAHH...                                                                        Orion: SHIIIIT...                                                                                   Alex: *Giggles* W-Wow.... OH M-MY GOOOOODDDDD... *Squealing* AAAAAAHh...                            Orion: OH GOOD LORD...                                                                              Alex: YES! Y-YES!                                                                                   Alex rides your cock hungrily, taking all of your length, balls deep inside her hot pussy as if she had been possessed.                                                                                 Alex: *Panting* YES! YES... Y-YES!                                                                  Orion: Oh Alex...                                                                                   Alex: *Panting* OH MY F-F-FFUCKING GOD...                                                           Orion: I-It's so fucking tight... So warm... So wet...                                              Alex: *Panting* AAahh... *Panting* I a-almost... c-can't breathe... *Panting* But I can't stop      either...                                                                                           Orion: (Dear Lord, I can feel how my cock fills her completely, stretching her to her physical      limit... The head of my dick hitting her cervix with each thrust...)                                Alex: AAARGH FUCK, Orion... P-P-Please don't cum... Not yet... I d-don't want this to s-stop...     *Groaning* AAAAaaRgh... Give me more of you...                                                      Just when you thought it was impossible, Alex still manages to increase her intensity and continues to ride you relentlessly.                                                                           Alex: *Squealing* F-FFFUCK YES! *Squealing* Fuck me, Orion! HARDER! DEEPER! Fill me up just like    that... I want every inch of you inside of me...                                                    You finally take a moment to lift your head and focus on the woman who seems to be draining the very essence of your being.                                                                             Orion: *Panting* Holy fuck... Oh my god, Alex, I'm gonna c-cum so hard... I c-can feel it coming... Alex: *Panting* I'm a-almost there... AAAaaHHhhh... *Panting* J-Just hang in there a bit more,      please... *Panting* Aaahhh... aaaAAaahh... AAAAHH! OH MY GOD!                                       Orion: OH ALEX... (How the fuck this couch is still standing is something I'll never know...)       Alex: AAAHH...                                                                                      Orion: (J-Just the tip, she said...)                                                                Alex: AAAAAHHHH... I...

Alex: *Panting* F-Fuck, I'm cumming too!                                                            Orion: Y-You need to... get off me...                                                               Alex: F-Fuck no...                                                                                  Orion: B-But–                                                                                       Alex: *Panting* F-Finish inside me...                                                               Orion: W-What...?                                                                                   Alex: *Panting* I want you... to cum... inside me! *Squeals* AAAAAAAGH! *Panting* G-Give me         everything you got...                                                                               Orion: B-But what if...                                                                             Alex: SHUT THE FUCK UP AND FILL ME UP!!!                                                            Orion: Oh babe... *Creampieing Alex* AAAAARGH!!!                                                    Alex: *Orgasming at the same time as you* AAAAAHHHH...                                              Orion: AAAArrrghhh... *Still cumming inside Alex* AAaaaahhhh...                                     Alex: *Breathing heavily* Aaahh... aaaahh... aaahhh... *Breathing heavily* Haha... I-I feel like you just unloaded a whole gallon inside of me...                                                       Orion: M-Maybe you’re not far off...                                                                Alex stands up with difficulty, while the hot load you just shot deep inside of her starts to ooze  out.                                                                                                Alex: *Rolling to the side* Unbelievable...                                                         Orion: My god...                                                                                    Alex: That got... a b-bit out of hand... haha...                                                    Orion: You're... too much...                                                                        Alex: This can't happen again, you know that, right?                                                Orion: W-What? Are you serious?                                                                     Alex: Absolutely. This will... never happen again. N-Never again...                                 Orion: Huh.                                                                                         Alex: Do you... understand?                                                                         Orion: Yeah... it won't happen again.                                                               Alex: It was... good... but it was a one time thing.                                                Orion: O-Okay.                                                                                      Alex: No more.                                                                                      Orion: Not in a million years.                                                                      Alex: Never again.                                                                                  Orion: Never...                                                                                     Alex: ...again. . . .                                                                               Orion: . . .                                                                                        Alex: . . . MMmmmMMMmMHH!                                                                           Alex briefly breaks the kiss, allowing herself a moment to catch her breath and find the words she  wants to share.                                                                                     Alex: *Whispering* F-Fuck, Orion... *Whispering* G-Go easy...                                       Orion: You know I can't, Alex...                                                                    Alex: *Moaning* Mmmmmm... T-That was supposed to be the last time...                                Orion: You were the one who followed me to the shower, remember...?                                 Alex: B-Because you were taking too long... and I'm the one paying the water bill.                  Orion: Suuure, you didn't come with any other intentions...                                         Alex: I'm not the one who got hard as soon as I stepped into the shower.                            Orion: Ah... well, I'm guilty there. I just love fucking you too much.                              Alex: *Giggles* Ah. *Whispering* Then do it... *Whispering* Fuck me hard, Orion...                  You shut her up by kissing her again, while continuing to pound her pussy nonstop.                  Alex: *Moaning* MMmmmmMmmhh...                                                                      Orion: (Oh my fucking god, this feels like heaven... How easily she lets me slide all the way into  the deepest depths of her... while still being outrageously tight... It's insane...)                Alex: *Moaning* MMmMh!                                                                              Orion: (She has a body made to sin. I mean, god, she's almost dripping more than the shower. I      wonder if I could ever make her squirt... make her banter that day at the park with Axel a          reality...)                                                                                         Alex: *Moaning* Mmmmm.... MMmmmmMhh... MMMMmmhHHHHh! *Moaning* MMMmmmmMmmm...                       You continue to penetrate Alex incessantly, pounding your body against the tattooed girl's slim     figure.                                                                                             Orion: (Fuck, I love how synchronized we are... The way she pushes her hips against mine with each  stroke... The fierce passion in her kisses, even despite the challenge of maintaining a constant    connection due to the relentless hammering... And how she pulls me back closer to her with her      leg... We’re as close as two humans could be, but it’s like she still hungers for more...)          Alex: *Moaning loudly* MMMmMMH!                                                                     Orion: (She wants me.)                                                                              Alex: *Moaning* MMmmmmmh!                                                                           Orion: (And I want her...)                                                                          Alex: *Moaning* MMMmmmmmMMmmhhhh...                                                                 Orion: (I want to break her...)                                                                     Alex: AAAAAAHH!                                                                                     You drastically increase your pace, with Alex responding in kind, adapting to the new rhythm almost instantly.                                                                                          Alex: Oh F-F-FUCK, Orion! AAAAaaaaaHHhhh...                                                         Orion: F-Fuck yes...                                                                                Alex: *Panting* W-We shouldn't have kissed... now y-you'll get sick...                              Orion: Fuck that... I'd get sick for a year if that meant I got to fuck you one more time...        Alex: AAAAaaahhh... yes... right there...                                                           Orion: O-Oh, Alex... I want to fuck you SO hard...                                                  Alex: *Panting* Y-Yeah, do it then... *Panting* Fuck me harder...                                   Orion: I want to break you... I want to find out where your limits are...                           Alex: *Panting* AAAahhh... YES... *Whispering* B-Break me... *Moaning* Oh m-my GODDDD... AAAHHHH!   *Panting* Shit, Orion, I'm gonna cum again...                                                       Orion: M-Me too, Alex...                                                                            Alex: *Squealing* AAAAARGH!                                                                         You continue to incessantly pound Alex's pussy as she groans loudly with pleasure. With the walls as thin as they are in these apartments, no doubt the neighbors could hear the two of you going at it continuously.                                                                                       Alex: AAAAAaaaAAAhhhhh... *Panting* F-Fuck...                                                       Orion: Shit, I'm almost there...                                                                    Alex: *Panting* Y-You can finish inside again, but...                                               Orion: Oh boy...                                                                                    Alex: *Panting* This is the last time, you hear me?                                                 Orion: O-Okay...                                                                                    Alex: *Panting* This was a mistake, we should’ve just stopped earlier...                            Orion: A-Agreed...                                                                                  Alex: *Panting* So t-this is it! F-For real this time... *Panting* Never again...                   Orion: Never...                                                                                     Alex: *Panting* Again... AAAaaaahhh... MY GOD... AAAAAAHHHHH!!! Y-YEAH! F-FUCK M-ME!! F-FUCK M-ME   H-HARDER...                                                                                         Orion: *Panting* Oh babe...                                                                         Alex: AAAahh... *Panting* T-T-This i-is i-it... *Panting* I-I'm a-at... m-my l-lim-mit... *Panting* I-I c-can't...                                                                                      Alex's voice cracks every time you shove your cock into her, which makes her words almost           unintelligible as the pleasure completely overtakes her.                                            Alex: AAAA-A-ARh-HhhHA...                                                                           Orion: (I'm almost at my limit as well... But fuck... dominating Alex like this is so damn hot...)  Alex: *Moaning* AAAAa-AGAHH...                                                                      Orion: Oooohhh, I'm almost there again...                                                           Alex: AAAaaaahh...                                                                                  Orion: *Pulling Alex's head* You're gonna take it all like the good princess you are, aren't you,   babe...?                                                                                            Alex: Ggggghh... *Panting* Y-Yeah.... *Panting* G-Give i-it a-a-all t-to m-me... *Panting* I w-want it...                                                                                               You continue pumping Alex's pussy until you both reach the bounds of raw, carnal ecstasy.           Alex: Oh m-my god. I'm c-cumming. I'm c-coming a-again... Aaaaaahh... AAAAAAAAaaaAAaahhh....        AAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaGGHHHHhhhh!!!                                                                     You can feel Alex orgasming even more intensely than before. Her whole body tenses up and her       vaginal walls contract, giving you a wave of unimaginable pleasure.                                 Orion: Fuuuuuck...                                                                                  Alex: *Panting* J-Jesusss C-Christ... *Panting* Orion... p-please...                                Orion: *Panting* I-I know, babe, just hold on a bit more, I'm almost... there... too...             Alex: *Panting* AAaaaahhh... I c-can't...                                                           Orion: *Panting* I am almost... AAAAAAAAGHHH...                                                     As if compelled by a primal instinct, you unleash every ounce of jizz left in you deep inside Alex  for the third time tonight.                                                                         Orion: Fuuuuuckk....                                                                                Alex: G-G-Gggghhh...                                                                                You slowly step away as you watch, almost with a sort of pride, a completely exhausted Alex         collapsing onto the ground.                                                                         Alex: *Panting heavily* Oh my fucking bloody fuck shitty fucked damnit fucker... *Panting heavily*  FUUUUUCK... I can barely even speak...                                                              Orion: *Leaning on the wall and recovering your breath* T-That was... p-pretty intense, huh?        Alex: I c-can't... stand up. I can’t feel my legs.                                                  Orion: You're an absolute wild beast, Alex. Tonight was... I don't even know how to describe it with words.                                                                                             Alex: I have never felt anything that comes even close to this... Just... holy fuck...              Orion: Well... I hereby declare your apartment officially christened.                               Alex: *Cracked chuckle* Yeah... I'd say it's been christened alright.                               Orion: *Trying to stand up* Jesus... I’m having trouble walking too. I'm going to take a shower. A  real one, this time.                                                                                Alex: Yeah... you go ahead. I'll go after. Probably better if I just stay out here this time...     Orion: You sure you're okay?                                                                        Alex: Yeah... I just need a minute to compose myself. Or maybe... a couple of minutes...            Both you and Alex take a shower to gather yourselves. Thirsty from the marathon of exertion, you    down an entire liter of water before finally collapsing onto the couch, utterly exhausted.          Orion: (Oh, boy... What a trip... What on Earth just happened? It felt like Alex and I were         participating in an unspoken competition to see who could break the other first. One of those rare  occasions where the loser is just as happy as the winner...)                                        Alex plops herself onto the couch next to you.                                                      Orion: Well, well, well... Feeling better after taking that shower?                                 Alex: Definitely. I'm starting to feel like myself again.                                           Orion: How many showers have you taken today?                                                       Alex: *Snorts* Too many. Although... in some of them I came out dirtier than when I went in.        Orion: Oh my, that doesn't sound like the Alex I know. I wonder what got into you...                Alex: This guy who invited himself over to my home. He got me drunk and took advantage of me.       Orion: *Laughs* How does that work, because we only drank tap water.                                Alex: Then I guess you put something in my pizza.                                                   Orion: *Chuckles* It's you who retrieved the order from the delivery guy.                           Alex: Then... you probably resorted to some other trickery.                                         Orion: Are you saying that you regret what happened tonight?                                        Alex: . . . I don't. Not one bit. Even if my swimming training tomorrow will be absolutely terrible because of you. You'll have to tell my coach that if I can't properly move my legs, you're the only one at fault.                                                                                       Orion: *Chuckles* Seems fair.                                                                       Alex: *Giggles* Mmh.                                                                                Orion: I bet now you appreciate how I approached you in school to compliment your pen. I bet now you appreciate how I approached you in school to compliment you.                                       Alex: *Laughs* The first day we met? I remember. I thought you were an idiot.                       Orion: But...                                                                                       Alex: *Laughs* What “but”? There's no “but”, that was lame. If anything, you should thank Mr.       Keating for assigning us to work together on that school project. It was that day I realized...     yeah... you were still an idiot, but... maybe not as much as I had initially thought.               Orion: I love seeing this affectionate side of you.                                                 Alex: You know I just called you an idiot, right?                                                   Orion: Yeah, because insults are an integral part of you, but... your eyes betray you. They reveal a different story. You can't hide your true feelings from me.                                        Alex: *Chuckles* Bullshit...                                                                        Someone knocks on the door.                                                                         Orion: Oh shit, could that be a neighbor coming to complain? We might have been too loud before...  Alex: Nope, it's pizza.                                                                             Orion: Pizza?                                                                                       Alex: Mm-hm.                                                                                        Orion: You ordered again? When?                                                                     Alex: While you were in the shower. I just happened to burn a shit ton of calories, thanks to       somebody, so I was hungry as fuck and took advantage of the 24-hour delivery service from Mario's   Pizza.                                                                                              Orion: Oh my god, I love you so much.                                                               Alex: *Standing up* Yeah, yeah, I'm coming! So yeah, after all, this is not happening ever again, so I thought... why not, we deserve it.                                                               Orion: *Chuckles* This is not the first time I've heard those words tonight.                        Alex: Oh, but now I really mean it. This is not happening again. ...at least for today.             Orion: (Oh boy... This woman is too much...) *Lying on the bed* (Alright! Eating something... check. Going the the bathroom... check. Visor... check. E-suit... check! Everything's ready for a long-run session! Dalia's already connected, and if I'm not mistaken, Alex should have sent me an invite by now. Unless her cold got worse...)                                                                  Connected. Welcome back to Eternum. You've received an invitation from... Alex.                     Orion: (Nice! Looks like it all went well.)                                                         Would you like to join her session?                                                                 Orion: Yes!                                                                                         Please prepare to connect...                                                                        Orion: *Lying down on the couch* (Holy fuck... This is real. This happened. I FUCKED ALEX. And not  only once... Man, how long have we been fucking like animals? She drained me like a succubus...) Oh, Alex, tell the delivery guy to give us some extra sodas too! *Lying down again* I could use the    sugar... (And... mind-blowing sex apart... maybe it's just me, but I feel like she finally stripped away all the layers and revealed her vulnerable, true self. There's something about her eyes... she looks at me very differently from the first time we met each other. I'm seeing the real her. I feel truly blessed.) You know, I've been looking at this ceiling A LOT tonight, but only now I am        realizing how elegant it looks. Hey, this ceiling looks pretty elegant, now that I’m really looking at it. This apartment of yours hides some secrets here and there, I've gotta say.                   You sit up and find two men where you were expecting to find Alex.                                  Orion: What... *In shock* W-Wha... W-Who the fuck are you? Where's Alex?!                           Bodyguard: . . .                                                                                    Orion: (Oh shit, they're armed... are they trying to rob the place??) W-What the fuck is going on?! Bodyguard: *Scouting the place* . . . All clear, sir.                                               Orion: (No way...)                                                                                  William Bardot: Hmph. And just when I thought that you couldn't besmirch our name any further... You still manage to drag it through the dirt once again, Alexandra. This place is nauseating.          Orion: You...                                                                                       William sits before you, his mere presence stifling the air and sending a shiver down your spine, as his icy gaze pierces through your soul.                                                            Orion: *Hyperventilating* . . . (F-Fuck, why can't I speak? I'm completely at a loss for words. Just a moment ago I was chilling with Alex on this couch and suddenly...)                               William Bardot: . . .                                                                               Orion: (There's something about this man that terrifies me...)                                      William Bardot: . . .                                                                               Orion: *Stammering* W-Where's Alex?                                                                 William Bardot: Alexandra's right outside, with one of my men. She'll join us shortly.              Orion: Why are you here...? W-What do you want?                                                     William Bardot: I just came to complete a procedure with my daughter. I'm just as surprised as you  are that we’re seeing each other here.                                                              Orion: (Okay... okay... you need to calm down, Orion. Don't let his henchmen intimidate you, they're just there to create fear. He's just a business man. A fucking corporate sell-out who only cares   about money and stock markets, that's all. And he doesn't know who I am! All he knows is that I'm a friend of Alex, and that I was there the day he hit her. He doesn't even know my name!) *Pulling    yourself together* Well, she doesn't want to see you, that's one thing I'm certain of. So take your henchmen and get the fuck out of here, will you?                                                    William Bardot: . . .                                                                               Orion: I guess you're not used to seeing people stand up against you, but as I told you the last    time... I'm not scared of you. And neither is Alex.                                                 William Bardot: . . . The last time... I suppose you're referring to the first time we saw each     other, in Priscilla's penthouse.                                                                    Orion: First and last time we met, fortunately.                                                     William Bardot: Hmm... Are you sure about that?                                                     Orion: Huh?                                                                                         William Bardot: I think you're mistaken. I believe the last time we saw each other was at the       Ulysses dinner hosted on the Rockefeller server. Was it not?                                        Orion: . . . What... What did you say...?                                                           William Bardot: . . .                                                                               Orion: How... How do you know...                                                                    William Bardot: I was surprised to see you there too. Although... not as much as when you went to   Wyatt's house with Nancy Carter, that's for sure. That was a bold move, I must admit. Too bad he's  been pushing up daisies for five years, eh?                                                         Orion: *Hyperventilating* W-What...?                                                                William Bardot: I guess that by now you must have already discovered that some of the NPCs used to  be real players. It is... as morbid as it is fascinating, isn't it?                                 Orion: *Hyperventilating* . . .                                                                     William Bardot: Although... I do wonder if you've also uncovered the true nature of Eternum and the secret that lies behind it.                                                                         A silence floods the room, broken only by the sound of the rain against the window and your         quickened breaths.                                                                                  William Bardot: Hmm... I guess not. Perhaps I was overestimating you after all. I mean... One would have expected that, after such a long time... A man in possession of the Third Weapon of Atlas would have managed to gather more than two Gems of Doom... Don't you think...? Orion?                    Orion: Oooooff... (Holy fuck, I feel as if I had just been beaten the hell up...) Mmmph... (Every   single muscle and bone in my body aches. Why?? I've been literally lying on this bed the entire day. Must be this never-ending rain messing with my joints...)                                          Dalia: Aghhhh, come on, Mom, I'll study tomorrow!                                                   Nancy: I said no!                                                                                   Dalia: *Grumbling* AAaagh!                                                                          Orion: (Oh, let's check with Dalia how that cabin thing went.)                                      Still feeling like a wreck, you stand up and open the door of your room.                            Orion: (Oh boy... look at that...)                                                                  Dalia: If I pull an all-nighter studying, can I go tomorrow?                                        Nancy: *From downstairs* I'll quiz you to make sure you do, young lady!                             Dalia: DEAL!                                                                                        Orion: H-Hey Dalia!                                                                                 Dalia: Hmm? Oh, hey Orion! You finally logged off! How'd it go?                                     Orion: We found El Coyote!                                                                          Dalia: No way! Seriously?! Do you have the Gem?!                                                    Orion: Nah... I took him down in a duel, but there was no Gem of Doom on him.                       Dalia: Agh, dammit. Didn't even consider that possibility. Good news, though - I know where all     their hidden bases are! Boone had all the info we needed. The man I found at the cabin had all the  info we needed.                                                                                     Orion: Oh, sick! I was hoping you'd say that.                                                       Dalia: We're planning to sneak into all the bases at once, catch him off guard, and finally get the Gem.                                                                                                Orion: Excellent!                                                                                   Dalia: Although... well, we can talk about it tomorrow. I've had enough Eternum for today, I don't  wanna start bleeding like those addicts.                                                            Orion: *Chuckles* Agreed. Wanna watch a movie or something?                                         Dalia: Nah, I can't. We got that Chemistry midterm on Monday, gotta study. That's what I was        discussing with Mom.                                                                                Orion: Oh, right. How are you holding up?                                                           Dalia: Pretty good! Check it for yourself, ask me anything.                                         Orion: Okay, um... How would you balance the chemical equation... Fe2O3 + CO -> Fe + CO2?           Dalia: . . . Uhm... O-Okay, I still need to take a last look. But I'll be ready tomorrow!           Orion: *Chuckles* Sounds good.                                                                      Dalia: It's such a bummer I can't go to Alex's as planned, though. I was supposed to go to her place to have dinner and give her my notes from last week.                                               Orion: Oh, really? Do you want me to take them to her for you? I don't mind.                        Dalia: For real? Would you do that?                                                                 Orion: Sure, I don't really have anything else to do now.                                           Dalia: Well... if you do us this favor, we'd appreciate it, for sure. Thank you, Orion! You're the  best. Sometimes you're not a total ass, go figure!                                                  Orion: No problem! I'll be on my way, though. I wanna be back in time to watch a movie after dinner.Dalia: I'll go take a shower and start studying, then! Be careful out there, it's raining cats and  dogs.                                                                                               Orion: I will! Catch you later!                                                                     Dalia: Bye-bye...                                                                                   Orion: (Oh boy, that was hot. Would say yes to anything if she asked while wearing that sexy bra.   Anyways, I guess I should go. Heh, I might get to see Alex's apartment after all. Hopefully she'll  let me in this time... Hopefully she'll let me in... Alright... here we are again.) *Shivers* (This place always give me the creeps. I feel like I'm about to get stabbed any second. Alright... here we are. 41 Oak Street, Apartment 25.) *Shivers* (This place gives me the chills. Why the hell did Alex choose to live here??)                                                                             You knock on the door.                                                                              Alex: It's open!                                                                                    You finally enter Alex's apartment. To your surprise, it's more spacious than you expected.         Orion: (Hey, this doesn't look half bad!)                                                           Alex: Come into the living room, I was just cleaning up a bit of the mess! Sorry, I was finishing   unpacking the last few boxes.                                                                       Orion: No worries! You shouldn't leave your front door open, though. Especially in this building.   Alex: Don't sweat it, I heard you in the elevator and– Wait... what? What are you doing here?       Orion: Surprise!                                                                                    Alex: Where's Dalia?                                                                                Orion: She had to stay because she has to study for Monday's test. She asked me to come in her place to bring you her notes. Didn't she tell you?                                                       Alex: Uhh... I don't know, I haven't checked my phone in a while. Um... well, thank you, I guess.   Orion: It's no problem. Are you feeling better?                                                     Alex: Huh?                                                                                          Orion: From your cold.                                                                              Alex: Oh... yeah, much better. Popped an anti-flu right after logging off.                          Orion: Good!                                                                                        Alex: Mm-hm.                                                                                        Orion: . . . *Clears throat* So... are you gonna show me your new ho–                               Alex: Nope.                                                                                         Orion: Come on! I'm already here!                                                                   Alex: And you're about to leave. The main bedroom is literally a mattress on the floor, the kitchen is a mess, and the living room is what you see. There's not much more to show.                      Orion: Everything looks great, don't worry so much about it. I'm happy to finally have seen it!     Alex: Mm-hm.                                                                                        Orion: Anyway... I guess I'll head back home by bus now.                                            Alex: Mm-hm... Thank you for swinging by.                                                           Orion: Although... damn, it's still pouring outside.                                                Alex: . . .                                                                                         Orion: Can I... perhaps... stick around for a bit? Only until it stops raining!                     Alex: *Sighs* I imagined you'd say something like that.                                             Orion: Is that a yes?!                                                                              Alex: *Grumbling* Hmmph... You can stay... but as soon as the rain stops, you're out! This is not a hotel.                                                                                              Orion: Yay!                                                                                         Alex: And... I have no TV, and was about to watch the national swimming Olympic qualifiers on my    laptop. So that's what we're gonna watch.                                                           Orion: I LOVE watching swimming competitions. Do you wanna order a pizza while we're at it? My      treat!                                                                                              Alex: Hmm... *Sighs* Alright, but let me lay a tablecloth down. And don't you dare to stain the     couch!                                                                                              Orion: We got ourselves a plan! Not a stain, I promise!                                             Someone knocks on the door.                                                                         Orion: Mmh...? *Waking up* U-Uh...? Where... w-where am I?                                          Alex: Lying on my couch like a human burrito. You dozed off while watching the swimming             qualifiers...                                                                                       Orion: Oh... s-shit, I'm sorry.                                                                     They knock again.                                                                                   Alex: Yeah, yeah, I'm coming! Jeez...                                                               Orion: *Still half-asleep* Who is it?                                                               Alex: Must be that darn neighbor again...                                                           Orion: Really? What time is it...?                                                                  Alex: 3:10 AM. I'll open. Just go back to sleep. I won't kick you out of the house now, don't       worry...                                                                                            Orion: *Lying down on the couch again* Jesus Christ, what the fuck is wrong with this guy... *Yawns* Now I can't sleep anymore. (Dammit, I shouldn't have fallen asleep. If things were already cold    with Alex, this sure didn't help much.) . . . He better have a damn good reason for bothering you at 3 in the fucking morning, I tell you. . . .
