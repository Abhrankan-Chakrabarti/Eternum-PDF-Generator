Orion: Ahh... I don't even know where to start... My name is Orion Richards. I was born in the city of Kredon, a relatively small town on the west coast of the United States. I lived there until I was 8 years old. Looking back at my childhood, I like to think I was a pretty happy kid, despite a few curveballs being thrown my way. My mother left shortly after I was born and my dad was never around much because he was always so focused on his job. That’s actually why we ended up moving to the UK; Dad needed to relocate there to keep his position. I know, I know, this all sounds pretty gloomy... but don't worry! This is not about to be one long sob story. Man... the big city! To be honest,     adapting to new places was never difficult for me. I was always able to quickly make new friends.   Even after moving, my father continued to work all day. I could never really blame him, though. He  had to work to support us both. Heaven knows where I'd be without him. So the UK is where I grew up and continued my studies. I don't consider myself to be a genius, but the truth is that I’ve always gotten good grades. In my spare time I enjoy going to the gym and playing all types of sports.      However, ever since I was young, I’ve always been addicted to all things technology—electronics,    computers, video games, gadgets... you name it! I’m especially passionate about making computer     graphics, too. Thanks to that passion and my good grades, I was just recently offered the           opportunity of a lifetime: to join a student exchange program and finish my last year of high school in Kredon—my hometown! Kredon has always been famous for its high school. All the students who     graduate there end up getting accepted to the best universities in the country. Many famous and     influential people studied in Kredon: Elon Musk, Warren Buffett, former President Stabb...          Obviously, as soon as I got the offer, I didn't have to think twice about it. I was thrilled at the opportunity! I packed my suitcase, said goodbye to my father and friends, and left as soon as I     could! Back to my roots. As for my personal life? *Chuckles* Let's just say I can't complain. I     don't know why, but I've always had a way with the ladies. I've slept with hundreds of women. They  all end up falling in love with me, as if by magic. To be honest, it actually gets kind of tiring.  What's my secret? Well, normally a magician never tells, but I guess I’ll fill you in... I, myself, believe the key to flirting is...                                                                   Chang: HAHA!                                                                                        Orion: Self-confidence and...                                                                       Chang: HAHAHA! HAHAHAHAHA! Oh shit, I can't breathe! Haha! *Laughs* Ok, ok, sorry, you can          continue... *Clears throat* G-Go ahead.                                                             Orion: Um... yeah, as I was saying, the key to flirting is...                                       Chang: Hahaha!                                                                                      Orion: . . .                                                                                        Chang: *Laughs* Sorry buddy, it's just that... *Laughs* The closest he’s been to getting laid was   last year when the school’s lunch lady slipped and fell on him... And now this motherfucker is here, proudly proclaiming he has slept with hundreds of women!                                           Orion: Hey, it was you who told me to say those things, remember? *Imitating Chang's voice* Bro, if you believe you're a player, you'll become a player. *Imitating Chang's voice* No one knows us in   this town. This is our chance to start fresh. *Imitating Chang's voice* We can be cool now. We can  be whoever we want to be!                                                                           Chang: *Laughs* Did I say that? Well, scratch that then. It’s not going to work. You should stick to the "nice" guy attitude. Look at me!                                                               Orion: You didn't get any girls last year either. You spent 2 months composing a song to ask Cindy  out, and when you finally did, she just laughed at you. And once she was finally able to catch her  breath, Jeremy broke your guitar!                                                                   Chang: Exactly! Did that stop me? Did that take away my smile?                                      Orion: You were crying for 2 weeks every time that-                                                 Chang: What I'm trying to say is that no matter what happens, you should never lower your head! Life is wonderful, Orion!                                                                               Orion: Yeah, well, if you say so...                                                                 Chang: And if all else fails, I'll always be someone you can depend on, my friend.                  Orion: Hah... I know, buddy. (Ah... Chang. I met him over 10 years ago when I started school in     London. He can be a bit weird at times, and that usually scares people. However, I would trust him  with my life. I know he'd do anything to help me, if necessary. Upon getting accepted to the Student Exchange Program, I was allowed to extend the invitation to some others as well. In total, there   were 3 slots available—one for me and two for whoever I asked to join. Chang was one of them, and   the other...)                                                                                       Annie: I'm back!                                                                                    Orion: (...was Annie.) Hey! Were you able to make that call?                                        Annie: Yes! Mission accomplished! There was a signal in the first car.                              Orion: Nice! (Annie is a close friend from my childhood. When I moved from Kredon, she was my       next-door neighbor and the first person I met. We quickly bonded after discovering we both had      something in common... the absence of our parents. Her father was a traveling salesman and her      mother was a flight attendant, so she almost never got to see the two of them. We were both lost... and lonely. After finding a companion within each other, we’ve been inseparable ever since. Annie is very polite, kind, and amiable. Because of how close we were, people always believed we were       dating... but the truth is, we're just friends. I mean… she's cute, and we love spending time with  each other, but I've never tried to make a move on her. I could never do it. She'd probably freak   out if I did. And I'm not interested at all either. I mean... Um... It wouldn't work. It would be... weird for us. Yeah! That's the word. Weird. It's just not the kind of relationship we have.)       Annie: Stop doing that!                                                                             Orion: W-What?                                                                                      Annie: You know what. You always do that! First you're talking to someone, then your wandering      thoughts take ahold of you and you stop listening.                                                  Orion: Me? That's not true.                                                                         Annie: What was I talking about?                                                                    Orion: When?                                                                                        Annie: Now. Before I brought you back into the real world.                                          Orion: Um... Something about... video games?                                                        Annie: . . . I knew you weren't listening to me.                                                    Orion: Um... Okay, sorry, it won't happen again.                                                    Annie: It better not! I was saying that I spoke with Nancy. She said she’s already there! She’ll be waiting for us outside Kredon's station.                                                            Orion: Ah, that's great! I can't wait to see her. I hope she recognizes me.                         Annie: *Laughs* I'm sure she will.                                                                  Orion: (I'm actually kind of nervous. Nancy used to be my babysitter in Kredon. Since my father was always working, I can recall more memories with her than with my dad. I used to spend the entire    afternoon playing with Nancy and her daughter Dalia, but then we had to move and ended up losing    touch. It was a nice surprise to discover that she was one of the host families working with the    Student Exchange Program. Living with them will be much cheaper than renting a student residence,   and it’ll surely be nice to see Nancy and Dalia again. Come to find out, she actually had 2 rooms   available, so Annie will have a place to stay as well! She’s actually been the one who’s been       coordinating with Nancy over the phone, even though they didn’t know each other beforehand. I've    always hated talking on the phone. I prefer chatting online, or talking in person.)                 Annie: Do you think she will like me?                                                               Orion: Nancy? Of course! Don't worry about it, Annie. I haven't seen her in over 10 years, so it’ll probably feel like I’m meeting her for the first time too!                                          Annie: I know, but I can't help feeling a little bit nervous. What about you, Chang? Do you know    anything about your host family?                                                                    Chang: Not much! I just know their names are Lucinda and Mark, and they have a daughter named       Micaela. They said their house isn’t very far away from the school. Micaela is supposed to be the   same age as us, so that's cool.                                                                     Annie: Sounds good!                                                                                 Public address system: Next stop: Delwick                                                           Annie: Ahh! We're almost there! That's the second-to-last stop! What's the first thing you're going to do when we get to our new home?                                                                  Orion: Well, say hello to everyone.                                                                 Annie: I mean after that, airhead!                                                                  Orion: To tell you the truth, I'm pretty tired. I think I'll just go to sleep. Tomorrow is our first day of school, so I’d like to start off on the right foot. I would hate for everyone’s first       impression to be from the Sleepy and Cranky Orion.                                                  Annie: *Giggles* Fair enough!                                                                       Orion: What about you? What will you do?                                                            Annie: Me? Logging into Eternum and playing a while, of course!                                     Orion: Ahh... I should’ve known. I don't even know why I asked. Eternum. Over the past year, every  single conversation I have seems to be about it. Just over a decade ago, a newly created company    called Ulysses announced their first game: A virtual, hyper-reality MMORPG that promised to         revolutionize the world of technology. With the game’s neural implant that recreates the five       senses, they said it’d become impossible to distinguish between the game and the real world.        "Eternum. More real than real life." They promised thousands of servers, absolute freedom, and      things never before seen in history. A big claim, for sure. But after they released the first       version of the game and players got to see things for themselves, everything they promised... turned out to be an understatement. It was better than one could've ever imagined. People became addicted to Eternum, to say the least. The neural implant required to play cost $3500 and could only be used by a single person. They started to call it "The drug of the rich". Shortly after the first release, Eternum added its own in-game currency and then Ulysses quickly became the biggest company in the  world. Today, Ulysses' market capitalization is worth $31 trillion U.S. dollars, more than 10 times that of Microsoft or Amazon. They say the owner of the company could buy out entire countries if he wanted. Not much is known about him, only that he created the entire game by himself and is referred to as... "The Founder". There's some weird shit going on with that... "game". Yeah, you can't die  in Eternum, but you can still feel pain. And there’s a dark side to the game too... black markets,  torture, rape, child sexual abuse material, data theft... Everyone knows about it, but world        governments turn a blind eye to it. Eternum abides by its own law. Its own rules. Its own police.   And people don't care. They can fulfill all their fantasies there. And that... seems to be all that matters. You should go to sleep too, Annie. We have to wake up early tomorrow.                      Annie: Yes, yes, I will! I'll just complete a couple of dungeons and pay a quick visit to the       market.                                                                                             Orion: I don't even know how the hell you managed to get enough money to buy yourself a neural      implant.                                                                                            Annie: Well, it’s because as soon as the game was announced, I worked every side-gig I could and    saved up each penny I earned! And it was SO worth it!                                               Orion: You play too much.                                                                           Annie: Nah, that's not true!                                                                        Orion: Yes, it is. How many hours a day do you play? 8? 10? You're addicted.                        Annie: You’re just saying all this because you’re jealous that you can't play Eternum!              Orion: W-What? Nah...                                                                               Annie: Yes, it's true.                                                                              Orion: Nah.                                                                                         Annie: Yes, it is.                                                                                  Orion: Nah.                                                                                         Annie: Yes.                                                                                         Orion: Nope.                                                                                        Annie: Yes! Admit it already! You're nothing but a big ball of envy because your best friend can    play Eternum and you can't since you didn't save any money.                                         Chang: WHAT?! B-Best friend? I thought I was your best friend, Orion!                               Orion: W-What? Oh, y-yeah, of course you are, buddy!                                                Annie: W-WHAT?! I'm not your best friend?                                                           Orion: Um... well, yeah, of course you’re my best friend Annie!                                     Chang: What?! Which is it Orion?! I need to know!                                                   Orion: You're both my best friends!                                                                 Chang: That's not saying anything! You have to choose!                                              Annie: Yeah, who's your bestest friend, me or Chang?                                                Orion: T-They're different kinds of friendship!                                                     Annie: But who means more to you?! Who is the ONE TRUE best friend?!                                Orion: Um... c'mon guys, don't make me do this... I mean... Um... Well, thinking about it           objectively... I guess...                                                                           Chang                                                                                               Orion: I guess it would be you, Chang. We've been through too much together.                        Chang: Ah, thank god! You scared me there for a moment, bro! The sun shines again!                  Orion: But that doesn't mean you aren’t also my best friend, Annie!                                 Annie: Mm-hm.                                                                                       Orion: Oh, c'mon! Please, don't get mad!                                                            Annie: Hmm.                                                                                         Orion: Are you gonna stop talking to me?                                                            Annie: Mm-hm.                                                                                       Orion: Forever?                                                                                     Annie: Mm-hm.                                                                                       Orion: Well, I guess it’ll just be the two of us going to Kredon now, Chang. We lost Annie.         Annie                                                                                               Orion: I guess it would be you, Annie.                                                              Annie: Ah... thank god... You scared me there for a moment...                                       Orion: We've been through too much together, Annie. You know I wouldn't have even accepted the      invitation to come here if you hadn't come with me.                                                 Annie: Thank you...                                                                                 Orion: But that doesn't mean you aren’t also my best friend, Chang! Huh? Chang? Um... Buddy? C'mon, Chang! You know I love you!                                                                         Chang: . . .                                                                                        Orion: You're my best... male friend!                                                               Chang: Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul.  Orion: Um... I’ll make it up to you! I promise that I’ll get you a beer after school tomorrow! But  turn that music off!                                                                                Chang: Ahh, it's a deal, my friend! Nothing like an ice cold, bubbly brewski to numb the pain!      Orion: Agreed!                                                                                      Chang: Ahhh... the sun shines again!                                                                Orion: Well, we should be there any moment now. Tell me, where are you supposed to meet your new    "family"?                                                                                           Chang: Mine said they're picking me up at the station too. The mom and the daughter... Apparently,  the dad is on a business trip. You know what that means...                                          Orion: That you're gonna get slapped for making unwanted advances?                                  Chang: Not this time, buddy. I'm the new Chang. Chang the Cool. Chang the Ladies' man.              Orion: *Laughs* Are you really gonna try to hit on your hostesses?                                  Chang: Not only them... All of Kredon is going to become my hunting ground. Nobody will be safe from Chang the Casanova!                                                                                Orion: *Laughs* Really? That doesn't sound like you. You've always called yourself a hopeless       romantic.                                                                                           Chang: That was the old Chang, not Chang the Womanizer. Chang the Charming cannot be pinned down    with monogamy.                                                                                      Orion: *Laughs* How many nicknames do you have?                                                     Chang: Chang the Modern Romeo has many names. More options for women to scream in bed.              Orion: *Laughs* You know, all kidding aside, I feel the same way. This place will be a good         opportunity to meet some ladies. *Whispering* Between you and me, people in our old city thought    Annie was my girlfriend, and that didn't help. *Whispering* We can make a name for ourselves in     Kredon. *Whispering* And... I don't know, I got a feeling my luck's gonna change. *Whispering* I'm  sure there will be lots of hot girls in...                                                          Annie: What are you muttering?                                                                      Orion: Nothing.                                                                                     Annie: Were you talking about girls?                                                                Orion: No.                                                                                          Annie: It's okay, you can tell me. I wanna be part of the conversation. I wanna know how men think. Orion: We were talking about... basketball.                                                         Annie: Who's playing?                                                                               Orion: Um... ...Golden State.                                                                       Annie: Against whom?                                                                                Orion: . . . The uhh... 49ers.                                                                      Annie: . . .                                                                                        Orion: . . .                                                                                        Public address system: Next stop: Kredon                                                            Orion: (Phew, thank goodness.)                                                                      Annie: *Getting up* Ah! That's our stop! Come on boys! We're finally here! Get your bags!           Orion: Let's go!                                                                                    Chang: Kredon here we come!                                                                         Annie: Well hello Kredon! Hello everyone! Annie is here! Hello new life! Hello new experiences!     Orion: *Carrying the suitcase* Hello luggage! I know you're excited Annie, but I'd appreciate it if you could at least carry your hand baggage!                                                         Annie: *Giggles* Sorry! It's just that I'm excited to discover the town where you grew up!          Orion: Well, I left this place when I was 8, so I don’t really remember anything. I’ve never had a  chance to come back ‘til now, so I'm excited to relive all my childhood memories! And now grab your luggage! How can a bag this small weigh so much?!                                                   Annie: *Laughs* Space management! It’s called being an efficient packer! Anyway, do you know where  Nancy is?                                                                                           Orion: Hmm... we were supposed to meet her here, right?                                             Annie: Yeah... But the station had 2 exits, remember? Maybe she's waiting at the other one.         Orion: Hmm... yeah, possibly. Can you go look? I'll stay here in case she's trying to make her way  to this side.                                                                                       Annie: Sure thing! Mission accepted! I'll come back for you if I find her. If you're the one who    finds her, don't leave without me!                                                                  Orion: Never!                                                                                       Annie: Alright. Be right back!                                                                      Lucinda: Chang?                                                                                     Chang: Oh... Mrs. Garcia?                                                                           Orion: (Hmm... she must be Chang's hostess.)                                                        Lucinda: Nice to finally meet you!                                                                  Chang: Y-Yeah, likewise.                                                                            Lucinda: My daughter is at the other exit, on the other side of the park. I'll go get her, wait     here!                                                                                               Chang: Sure thing, ma'am.                                                                           Lucinda: Ohh, aren't you a polite and handsome young boy? I'm sure you and Micaela will become great friends!                                                                                           Chang: I'm sure of it, Mrs. Garcia.                                                                 Lucinda: You're so cute! Anyway, give me a minute, we'll be leaving here soon!                      Chang: Of course. . . .                                                                             Orion: Well, I take back what I said earlier, buddy. She's eating out of the palm of your hand. If  you want to seduce her, it'll be a piece of cake.                                                   Chang: What the fuck, man?!                                                                         Orion: Hm? What's the matter?                                                                       Chang: She's fat! She looks like a fifty-something-year-old woman!                                  Orion: Um... maybe because she is a fifty-something-year-old woman? What the hell were you          expecting?                                                                                          Chang: I... I don't know! She looks nothing like the step-moms in porn! They’re all hot as fuck!    Orion: That's because that's porn and this is real life. And she's not even your step-mom!          Chang: My life is ruined!                                                                           Orion: *Laughs* Come on, it's not that bad. Maybe her daughter is hot.                              Chang: No... she's gonna be short and fat, just like her mother... Damn you, genetics!              Orion: Not necessarily. You have to be optimistic! I'm sure she'll be a hottie. Trust me! Hmm? (What the hell, all the birds in the park suddenly flew away... Weird... Hm? What's this shadow? There   isn't a cloud in the sky. It's like... Hmm? W-What the...)                                          Micaela: Hi! I'm Micaela! Are you Chang?                                                            Orion: Um... N-No. I'm... I'm... Orion. N-Nice to meet you.                                         Micaela: Nice to meet you Orion. I'm sorry if I scared you.                                         Orion: No! I mean, you just startled me because I wasn't expecting you.                             Micaela: No worries, I know I can have a rather intimidating appearance at first.                   Orion: Yeah, but that's cool! You look so strong.                                                   Micaela: Thanks, I'm preparing for the national weightlifting competition. Anyway, you must be Chang then.                                                                                              Chang: Y-Yes.                                                                                       Micaela: I guess we're gonna be "roommates" over the next few months. I'm sure we'll get along. My  mom's a great cook!                                                                                 Chang: Cool...                                                                                      Lucinda: Micaela! There you are! Have you met Chang already?                                        Micaela: Hey Mom! Yeah, we were just getting acquainted.                                            Lucinda: *Whispering* He's so good-looking, isn't he?                                               Micaela: *Whispering* M-Mom! Don't embarrass me!                                                    Orion: Well... I'm sorry man. I know you were expecting top models, but at least they seem nice.    You’ll be better living with them instead of in a shared room, that's for sure. And hey, we'll only be here for a few months anyway.                                                                    Chang: She's... My god... She's perfect...                                                          Orion: . . . ?                                                                                      Lucinda: Have you gone to the gym today, Micaela? You look good!                                    Micaela: Yeah! My new tricep routine is starting to pay off and it’s really starting to help out my bench as well! I can put up 250 pounds now and churn out a few reps with ease.                      Lucinda: Amazing! You'll do very well in the competition!                                           Orion: Um... I didn't know that was your type...                                                    Chang: Look at those graceful curves in all the right places...                                     Orion: W-What curves?                                                                               Chang: I wonder if it hurt when she fell from heaven...                                             Orion: . . . Um... Are you sure we're talking about the same girl? She looks to me like she's about to confront the Avengers.                                                                           Chang: This is the woman I'm gonna marry one day, Orion. Mark my words. I think I'm in love...      Orion: I thought Chang the Charming was not one for monogamy. What happened to not getting tied down by one woman?                                                                                      Chang: Chang the Enamored has no eyes for other women... he has met the peanut butter to his        jelly...                                                                                            Lucinda: Chang! Let's go! We'll show you your room!                                                 Chang: Y-Yes! I'm coming!                                                                           Lucinda: Say goodbye to your friend. We'll wait for you in the car! We’re parked over by the park’s exit.                                                                                               Chang: OK! Oh my god, Orion, I hit the jackpot!                                                     Orion: *Laughs* Well, if you say so... I'm happy for you, buddy. Go get her, tiger.                 Chang: She's the woman of my dreams! Isn't she perfect?!                                            Orion: Um... yeah, sure... very perfect.                                                            Chang: Don't you even think about making a move on my woman, bro!                                   Orion: No! Don't worry, she isn’t really my type... And I'd never do that to you, buddy.            Chang: I know! Anyway, I have to go! I'll see you tomorrow at school!                               Orion: Sure! Have fun!                                                                              Chang: Later!                                                                                       Orion: (Well... I wonder how that will end... I guess time will tell. Hmm... Nancy hasn’t arrived   yet. I guess Annie must’ve found her on the other side of the park. I guess I’ll sit on that bench  and wait for them. Ahh... Kredon seems to be as peaceful as I remembered. There are quite a few     high-rise buildings in the center, but it doesn’t have all the hustle and bustle of a big city.     People must like keeping a peaceful atmosphere in these public areas. Either that, or everyone's    home playing Eternum... In any case, it feels pretty relaxing here. Hmm? What's that sound? Oh! A   damn phone booth! I haven’t seen those in a while! In the city, they were all removed a long time   ago. A relic of the past...) . . .  (Hmm... Won't that thing ever stop ringing? It's kinda          annoying.)                                                                                          Pick up the phone                                                                                   Orion: (Who the hell even calls a payphone?) . . . (Jesus Christ, maybe I should just pick up the   phone so it’ll stop ringing! Okay, let’s see what kind of idiot calls a phone booth...) Erm...      hello? . . . Heeellooo... . . . (Well, I guess that...)                                             ???: Orion.                                                                                         Orion: E-Excuse me? (D-Did she say my name? No... That's impossible. I must have misheard her...)   Hello? I'm sorry, I can't hear you too well. Could you repeat that?                                 ???: You must find Calypso. You must use it to open the doors of Acheron. You must break the chains.Orion: The what? What are you talking about?                                                        ???: . . .                                                                                          Orion: Um... I'm sorry, I think you’re trying to reach somebody else.                               ???: *Hangs up*                                                                                     Orion: Hello? (They hung up... What the hell was that... That was weird... Should I try to call them back...?) FUCK!                                                                                    Granny: Hey! I need to use the phone, young man!                                                    Orion: I was here first, ma'am!                                                                     Granny: I don't care! I have to call my son! It's urgent! Don't you have a cell phone?! Use it!     Orion: Ok, ok, just give me two minutes.                                                            Granny: NO! I need to get ahold of my son NOW!                                                      Let her make the call                                                                               Orion: *Sighs* Ok, ok, call your son... ma'am.                                                      Granny: Get out!                                                                                    Orion: (Old, ungrateful witch... Well, it doesn't matter. I doubt they would have answered if I     called back. That was some weird shit, though...)                                                   Nancy: I see you’re still the courteous little Orion that I remember!                               Keep her waiting                                                                                    Orion: Honestly, ma'am, I don't care. Just wait your turn like everybody else.                      Granny: WHAT?!                                                                                      Orion: Let's try to call back... Hmm...                                                             Granny: Hurry up!                                                                                   Orion: Grrrr... (They're not answering... Anyway, it was worth a try.) Ok, ok, you can come in now! Granny: You're a very rude young man!                                                               Orion: Yeah, yeah, whatever.                                                                        Granny: Get out!                                                                                    Orion: (Old, saggy witch... Well, it doesn't matter… probably just some misunderstanding, I guess.  But that was definitely weird, though...)                                                           Nancy: Orion?!                                                                                      Let it ring                                                                                         Orion: (Who the hell even calls a payphone? Well, they'll get bored and give up, I guess.) . . . . . . (Finally! Jesus, people sure have patience... I wonder who it was...)                            Nancy: Orion?!                                                                                      Orion: Huh? Nancy?! Oh my god, is that really you?!                                                 Nancy: Orion! I can't believe you're finally here!                                                  Orion: It's so nice to see you, Nancy!                                                              Nancy: So you still remember me!                                                                    Orion: Of course I do! How could I forget you?                                                      Nancy: I don't know... after all these years, I thought you’d have forgotten all about Kredon by    now.                                                                                                Orion: That's impossible!                                                                           Nancy: Damn, boy... Look at you! You have become a man! Where's that skinny kid that left our town  just over a decade ago? You're even hitting the gym now, I see!                                     Orion: *Chuckles* Well, whenever I can.                                                             Nancy: Although I do find it pretty satisfying to see that you still aren’t taller than me.         Orion: What?! I am taller than you! What happened is that you've learned to take advantage of 6-inch heels! That's not fair!                                                                            Nancy: *Laughs* I'm just using whatever weapons are at my disposal! But seriously, puberty did you  good, Orion.                                                                                        Orion: Thanks, Nancy.                                                                               Nancy: I guess time has its way with us all.                                                        Orion: Clearly not for you! You look like you haven’t aged a day! How's that possible?              Nancy: Hah! I wish. I see your memories are still blurry...                                         Orion: No way! My memories are crystal clear. You definitely look just as pretty as the last time I saw you!                                                                                            Nancy: *Giggles* Well, if you insist... Thank you. I try to take care of myself. My yoga classes    work wonders... both physically and mentally.                                                       Orion: Well you’re definitely doing something right. You look great, Nancy! How old are you now?    When I was 8, you were in your mid-twenties, so now you must be...                                  Nancy: Hey! Hold it right there, mister! Didn't your father teach you manners? You can't ask a lady her age! You clearly need a strong female influence in your life. Seems like I have my work cut out for me, young man!                                                                                  Orion: *Laughs* I see you haven’t changed a bit, either.                                            Nancy: I'm so happy to see you here, Orion. Kredon has missed you.                                  Orion: And I'm happy to be back.                                                                    Annie: Mission failed, Orion... There was no one on the other side of the park...                   Nancy: AAAH! You must be Annie! Is that right?!                                                     Annie: Y-Yeah.                                                                                      Nancy: You're even cuter than I imagined! Your voice matches your appearance so much!               Annie: T-Thank you, miss.                                                                           Nancy: It’s me, Nancy! Even though we’ve only been speaking on the phone for the past few days, I   feel like we’ve been becoming good friends already! Isn't that right, Annie?                        Annie: Definitely! I’d say we’ve been hitting it off pretty well! It's so nice to finally meet you! Nancy: AHH! You're so cute! Alright! Now that we're all here, we should start making our way home!  I've prepared a room for each of you, though I must warn you – don't expect anything fancy. The     bedrooms are pretty small.                                                                          Annie: No worries, miss! I'm sure it'll be more than enough!                                        Nancy: I hope so! And please, just call me Nancy!                                                   Annie: Ok! Thank you, Nancy!                                                                        Nancy: Have you ever been to the USA before, Annie?                                                 Annie: Never! But I’ve always wanted to visit. Orion has always spoken very well of his time in     Kredon. And of his babysitter!                                                                      Nancy: Oh, really?                                                                                  Orion: Yeah, since my Dad was constantly working, I've always said you were like a parent to me.    Nancy: I'm glad to hear that! Now I work in a laboratory, but back then I was still finishing my    thesis. Thankfully Orion's father came along and offered me the babysitting gig. It was not only    well-paid, but also allowed me the flexibility to take care of my daughters at the same time. And   for me, being a single mother, that was essential.                                                  Annie: You have 2 daughters, right?                                                                 Nancy: Yes, Dalia and Penelope. Penny was a little older when I was Orion's nanny, so she used to   play on her own, but Dalia got very close to him!                                                   Orion: *Laughs* I remember she was always stealing my games!                                        Nancy: But then, after my daughters grew up, I was able to start a better job within a local        company. Speaking of which, please excuse my outfit... I just got off from work.                    Annie: "Excuse"? Nonsense, that's a beautiful suit! You look very professional!                     Nancy: Ahh, aren't you cute!                                                                        Orion: (Damn, did Nancy always have such big boobs? They're massive... I guess you don't notice that stuff when you're 8 years old... Man, imagine burying your face between those things... Ok, now I  sound like some old perv. I should probably stop looking before she notices. That’ll definitely make the situation awkward.) . . . (Why can't I stop looking...)                                        Nancy: Don't you think, Orion?                                                                      Orion: Yes! Absolutely! (Oh shit, I have no idea what she was talking about...)                     Nancy: Alright then! Let's go to the car! Dalia and Penelope are dying to see you again!            Orion: Oh, really?                                                                                  Nancy: Well, um... maybe not so much. I couldn't even convince them to tag along to pick you up...  You know how it is... they're at "that age". I had a little rebellious phase when I was a teenager  too. But in any case, I'm sure they'll be happy to see you again! Let's not waste any more time. My car is parked over on the next street!                                                              Orion: Let's go!                                                                                    Nancy: Here we are!                                                                                 Orion: Wow... the memories... (I still remember this place like it was yesterday... Nancy used to   pick me up after school and we'd come here. Each day I would spend the afternoon playing with her   and Dalia. We had dinner every night at eight, and then Nancy drove me home once it got late. Now I can't help but feel a little bad for not keeping in contact with them... She would always call me on my birthday, but... aside from that, I never reached out. I have to make it up to her somehow.)    Nancy: Brings back memories, doesn't it, Orion?                                                     Orion: It does! It feels like I’m home again.                                                       Nancy: I told you that when you left Orion... this will always be your home!                        Orion: I know. Thank you, Nancy.                                                                    Annie: WOW!                                                                                         Nancy: Do you like it, Annie?                                                                       Annie: This place looks awesome! Are you rich?!                                                     Nancy: *Laughs* No, I wish. Houses in Kredon are not that expensive.                                Annie: It's beautiful! I'm used to living in a flat, so this looks like a palace to me!             Nancy: My husband and I bought it when I was pregnant with Dalia. Although he left before she was   born, so I was left paying the mortgage all by myself... *Clears throat* But that's a story for     another day! Come on, let's go in quickly before it starts to rain. You first, Orion!               Annie: Rain? Those don't look like rain clouds to me.                                               Nancy: It rains almost every day in Kredon.                                                         Orion: Oh... Now that you’ve mentioned it... Yeah, I guess I do remember the rain.                  Nancy: It's almost a miracle it was sunny today. Believe me, I've learned to read this sky. It'll   start to rain soon.                                                                                 Annie: That's cool! I love rainy days!                                                              Nancy: *Laughs* You say that now, but you’ll get tired of them after a while. Alright, let's go!    Dalia and Penelope will be inside waiting for us!                                                   Orion: Can't wait!                                                                                  Nancy: Dalia! Penelope! We're here!                                                                 Orion: Hey! You still have that painting you made!                                                  Annie: Did you paint that?!                                                                         Nancy: Yeah, I used to paint in my free time, but I haven't done anything in years.                 Annie: Impressive!                                                                                  Orion: Everything looks like it hasn’t changed a bit... Damn, it feels so good to be back. Is Dalia still the same hyperactive, pigtailed girl that I remember? *Laughs* And Penelope the preteen that  was too "cool" to play with Dalia and me?                                                           Nancy: Well... see for yourself! Dalia! Penelope!! Come here!                                       Penelope: *Upstairs* Mom!                                                                           Dalia: *Upstairs* Mom?!                                                                             Penelope: *Upstairs* Finally!                                                                       Dalia: *Upstairs* She's here!                                                                       Penelope: *Upstairs* Get out of my way, I'm first!                                                  Dalia: *Upstairs* What?! I'm first! Back off!                                                       Penelope: *Upstairs* Don't push me! I SAID I'M FIRST!                                               Dalia: SCREW YOU!                                                                                   Nancy: Wow, girls! I wasn't expecting you to be so excited to meet Orion again!                     Dalia: Huh?                                                                                         Penelope: Who?                                                                                      Dalia: Orion?                                                                                       Penelope: Oh... O-Of course! Orion!                                                                 Dalia: Oh, y-yeah, so excited! Hi Orion!                                                            Penelope: It's been a while!                                                                        Dalia: Yeah, welcome back!                                                                          Orion: Thanks! So good to see you!                                                                  Dalia: Same here!                                                                                   Penelope: Yes! So good!                                                                             Orion: Yeah!                                                                                        Dalia: Good!                                                                                        Penelope: Good, yeah!                                                                               Dalia: Good...                                                                                      Penelope: Ok, Mom, I need to ask for a favor! PLEASE!                                               Dalia: Mom! Listen to me first! It's urgent!                                                        Penelope: That can wait! I need help!                                                               Nancy: *Sighs* What happened now?                                                                   Penelope: I need the car! Just for a couple of hours! My entire career depends on it!               Dalia: I need my running shoes! I can't find them! They say it's going to rain in half an hour!     Nancy: Both of those things can wait! You didn't even welcome Orion and Annie properly! They're     gonna live with us for a whole year. You know that, right?                                          Penelope: But we just did! Orion! I can't wait to properly meet you! I wish I could stay, but I     really need to go! Oh, and you must be Annie! Nice to meet you too!                                 Annie: Thank you!                                                                                   Dalia: Welcome to the family! By the way, I love your haircut!                                      Annie: *Giggles* Thank you so much!                                                                 Dalia: Damn Orion, you look... tall!                                                                Orion: Thanks, Dalia. You look... tall too. Taller than you used to be, at least.                   Dalia: I'm sure we'll have so much fun later reminiscing about the old days, but I have to complete my training now. Y-You don't mind, do you? PLEASE?!                                                 Penelope: Of course he doesn't mind! You wouldn't want to destroy my career, right? RIGHT?!         Ask them to stay                                                                                    Orion: Well, I was expecting you to stay and hang out today... Come on, I'm sure your other plans   can wait.                                                                                           Penelope: Ugh... Thank you for your help, Orion. I can see you're a cool one, jeez... Don't listen  to him, Mom!                                                                                        Ask for a favor in return                                                                           Orion: Well, maybe if you do me a simple favor later, I won’t mind you leaving...                   Penelope: Um... excuse me? A favor? Do you think we're making a deal or something? I was asking for support, not permission. I can see you're a cool one, jeez... Don't listen to him, Mom!             Let them go                                                                                         Orion: Sure, no worries. I was going to sleep early anyway. We can talk tomorrow!                   Penelope: See?! Even Orion is asking you to let us go!                                              Dalia: Because he's cool! It's good to see the city didn't change you, Orion.                       Nancy: *Sighs* What do you need the car for?                                                        Penelope: Gucci is doing a casting call for female models at the mall! This is the opportunity I've been waiting for! My chance to become a professional model! To finally make my dreams come true!    Please, Mom!                                                                                        Nancy: Hmm... And they’re only doing it today?                                                      Penelope: Yes!                                                                                      Nancy: And you won’t have to wear anything risque right? Won’t be wearing only your underwear or    something crazy?                                                                                    Penelope: Of course not! What do you take me for?                                                   Nancy: Hmm... Ok, ok, take the keys... But I want you home before 10. And don't talk to any         strangers outside of the casting call!                                                              Penelope: Mom! I'm not 10 years old anymore! But thank you! I'll be right back, I promise! Bye!     Nancy: Well then, what's the matter with you?                                                       Dalia: Where are my running shoes?! The ones that can get wet!                                      Nancy: They're next to the garage door, but you're not going anywhere.                              Dalia: Mom!! You can't do this to me! I need to run 10 miles every day or I'll stay behind! Kredon's annual race is next week!                                                                          Nancy: So what's the big deal? You're already one of the best athletes in town!                     Dalia: But not the best. That damn Micaela always lifts more weight than I do! I can't beat her at  that, but I can beat her at the run if I train every day. Perhaps in squats too. If I skip a single training day, she could humiliate me again like last year. I'm not gonna let that happen. Please,   Mom!                                                                                                Nancy: Ok, ok... you can go, but same as your sister: I want you home before 10.                    Dalia: Yes! I won’t be a minute late! Thanks Mom, you're the best! Love ya!                         Nancy: *Sighs* What am I gonna do with these two... I'm so sorry guys, this is not what I wanted to happen...                                                                                           Orion: Don't worry about it, Nancy! As I said, I think I'm going to sleep very early today.         Nancy: Annie, you must have gotten the wrong impression of my daughters...                          Annie: Not at all! They both seem really nice! For tonight, I’d rather just unpack all my things and freshen up a bit. We have plenty of time to get to know each other in the days to come!            Nancy: You're so nice, Annie. Is there anything I can do for you?                                   Annie: Well, since you asked... What's the WiFi password?                                           Orion: Ah... still planning to log into Eternum?                                                    Annie: *Giggles* I’m just going to check to make sure everything is still working...                Orion: Sure...                                                                                      Nancy: Oh, you play Eternum too? Dalia is really hooked on that game.                               Annie: REALLY?! Oh boy, this is great news!                                                         Nancy: Sometimes I think Dalia does nothing all day except play Eternum and go to the gym. Maybe you can play together sometime.                                                                        Annie: Of course! I'll invite her to my favorite server: Ion! Wait! No! Plains of Denaria! No, no!  Xala's Moon!                                                                                        Orion: *Yawns* Well, I think I'm off to bed.                                                        Nancy: What?! Without any supper?                                                                   Orion: Yeah... I'm sorry, I’m having a hard time keeping my eyes open. I couldn't sleep on the      plane, nor on the train ride from the airport.                                                      Nancy: It's okay honey, I understand. Of course you can go to sleep. Your room will be on the second floor—the last one on the right.                                                                   Orion: Ah, I remember that room! It was the one with a lot of natural light.                        Nancy: That’s the one! So please, make yourself at home! Well, since Orion seems to remember where  everything is already... Do you want a tour of the house, Annie?                                    Annie: I'd love that!                                                                               Orion: Ok! I'll leave you two alone! Good night, girls.                                             Annie: Goodnight Orion! Sweet dreams!                                                               Nancy: Tomorrow is your first day at your new school, so it's probably a good idea to get a good    night’s rest. Goodnight, Orion.                                                                     Orion: See you tomorrow! *Yawns* (Well, this is gonna be my room for a whole year. Looks nice! There wasn't a bed here before. I guess Nancy fitted it out to serve as a bedroom. It's not the biggest  room, but I have more than enough space. And there's a big wardrobe, perfect to keep all my stuff   in. Hmm... I could hang up some posters of my favorite shows or video games on this wall. Or maybe I should get a couple of bookshelves from IKEA...) *Yawns* (I'll think more about it tomorrow. Nancy seemed awfully sure it was going to rain, but I'm not so certain. There isn't a cloud in the sky. I hope it actually does rain though... I like the sound of raindrops falling against the window. These trees make the room look so cozy. Anyway, time to sleep. Big day tomorrow! I don't think I'll have trouble falling asleep tonight...) *Yawns* (I've never been so... Tired in my entire... My          entire...) What... Where... Where am I... What the hell... (What the fuck is going on... This is not Nancy's house... A... a kid's room? How did I end up here?) N-Nancy? Annie? (What the... W-Who the fuck is this kid...) N-Nancy? W-Who is this kid? This is not funny! . . . Buddy, are you lost?      . . .                                                                                               Orion: H-Hey, can you hear me? Boy, are you lost? Where are we?                                     . . .                                                                                               Orion: (I don't like this shit...) *Kneeling* Hey, boy! Can't you hear me?! I’m only trying to help you, but I can't if you won't talk to me. Is this your room? Did I accidentally barge in? If so, I'm sorry. Do you know where your Mom is?                                                              . . .                                                                                               Orion: (This place is creeping me out... I'm getting the hell out of here.)                         Kid: Orion?                                                                                         Orion: W-What? Y-Yes, I'm Orion! D-Do you know me? Uhh... kid...?? Listen to me! *Hyperventilating* W-What the fuck is going on... (W-Where am I now?! Ok, I m-must be dreaming. A p-pretty fucking     vivid dream, that's all. I just wanna wake up... I'll find the exit, I'll wake up, and then I'm     gonna go d-downstairs and enjoy my b-breakfast. This must be some church I visited when I was a kid, y-yeah. And now my mind is...) *Hyperventilating* H-Hello? M-Miss? Do you know where we are? (Does she want me to follow her? Fuck...) M-Miss? Where are we? You don't talk either?                    . . .                                                                                               Orion: (Fuck this shit, man...)                                                                     Lady: Will you help us?                                                                             Orion: You talk! L-Listen, do you know how to get out of here?!                                     Lady: Will you help us?                                                                             Orion: What? What are you talking about?                                                            Lady: Will you help us?                                                                             Orion: Help with what? Who's "us"?                                                                  Lady: Will you help us?                                                                             Orion: . . .                                                                                        Lady: Will you help us?                                                                             Yes                                                                                                 Orion: Y-Yes, I will help you.                                                                      Lady: . . . Why?                                                                                    Orion: W-Why? Um... I don't know... If I can help, why wouldn't I?                                  Lady: . . .                                                                                         No                                                                                                  Orion: N-No, I won't help you.                                                                      Lady: . . . Why?                                                                                    Orion: W-Why? Um... I don't know, I... I don't even know who you are! Why would I help you? I just  wanna leave this place!                                                                             Lady: . . .                                                                                         Orion: *Hyperventilating* O-Okay, I can't anymore. I... *Turning around* Oh shit... P-Please, don't kill me! I told you I'd help! I'm sorry I said that! I've changed my mind! I'll help you! What more do you want?! AAAAAAARGHHH! FUCK! (I'm... in my room... 06:55 AM... Oh my fucking god, I'm drenched in sweat. I’ve never had a nightmare like that before... I hardly ever dream in the first place...  Well, at least it's over... I need to pull myself together now. Hmm... looks like Nancy was right   after all. It's really coming down out there. Anyway, first day of school! I wanna get there early  to start the day off right! No rain can stop me, baby!) *Taking your pants off* (School is a        15-minute walk from here, so I have time. I guess I'm the first to get up. The girls must still be  sleeping.)                                                                                          Nancy: GOOD MORNING!!!                                                                              Orion: HOLY SHIT! N-Nancy! You almost gave me a heart attack! I was about to... Um...               Nancy: Oh...                                                                                        Orion: Get dressed...                                                                               Nancy: Oh my god! I'm s-sorry! Oh god, how embarrassing...                                          Orion: It's fine, don't worry.                                                                      Nancy: I'm used to only living with my daughters, and... We'll put a lock on the door so it doesn't happen again! Does that sound okay with you?                                                        Orion: A lock?                                                                                      That's a good idea                                                                                  Orion: Sure, sounds good.                                                                           Nancy: Great! I'll put a lock on all the doors so everyone can have some privacy.                   Orion: Alright...                                                                                   Knocking on the door is enough                                                                      Orion: Nah, don't worry Nancy. If you could please just knock before entering, I think that’d be    enough.                                                                                             Nancy: Yes! Absolutely! I will.                                                                     Orion: Alright then.                                                                                There's no need for that                                                                            Orion: Nah, don't worry Nancy. It's like we're family now. I’m not bothered by you at all!          Nancy: O-Okay... Thank you Orion!                                                                   Orion: No problem. Well, um... I think I'm going to shower.                                         Nancy: Oh! Yeah! Of course. Um... Remember to wear your uniform to school. It's waiting for you in  the closet. Annie, Penelope, and Dalia have been up for a while!                                    Orion: What?! You all are up already?                                                               Nancy: Of course! We've always been early risers. Anyway, I gotta go to work. See you in the        afternoon!                                                                                          Orion: Oh, ok. Have a nice day!                                                                     Nancy: B-Bye!                                                                                       Orion: *Laughs* (Well, that sure was funny. It probably would’ve been funnier if it had happened the other way around, though... Anyway, let's see that uniform...                                      Nancy: God, that was awkward. I guess I have to be more careful from now on. I haven’t seen him     naked since I used to bathe him when he was 5. A lot of time has gone by since then. He wasn't so... big back then, that's for sure. Damn, he's well-endowed. And he wasn't even hard. I wonder how big he can get... Jesus, look at me. Fantasizing about the dick of the kid I used to care for. You're 20 years older than he is, Nancy, for fuck's sake. I think it’s because I’ve been without a man for   too long... Maybe now that Dalia and Penelope have become more independent, I could start dating    again. It's been so many years since my last date, I don’t think I can even remember the last one I went on. Although, I think I'll wait a couple of weeks. I don't want Orion and Annie to think I'm a promiscuous woman or anything... In the meantime, I guess I’ll just keep fantasizing about things   that’ll never really happen anyways. Because I won't deny it... I enjoyed that. As long as no one   knows what I'm thinking, who's going to judge me?                                                   Orion: Hey, not bad... This looks kinda good! It’ll be nice not having to think about what to wear  every day. Plus, when I do get to dress up, I’ll have an excuse to be fancy. It all seems good to   me. Alright, let's go to the kitchen. I hope I don't spill anything on my clothes...) Hey Dalia!    Good morning!                                                                                       Dalia: Hey Orion!                                                                                   Orion: *Taking a deep breath* (Ahh... I feel like I've lived here all my life. Even if I haven’t    seen Dalia, Nancy, or Penelope for over 10 years... Kredon still feels like my home. It's the place where I was born after all. I guess there are some things and places you just can’t forget.)        Dalia: Whoa... It's pouring out there.                                                              Orion: It always rains here, right?                                                                 Dalia: Yeah... But I really hope it stops by tomorrow morning. There's a swimming competition at    school that I need to win...                                                                        Orion: I'm sure you'll do fine!                                                                     Dalia: Thanks... *Giggles* I'm sorry, I was here making small talk as if you’ve been here for weeks. Goddammit, it's been a while, Orion!                                                               Orion: I know! It's so nice to see you all again. And don't worry about it, I’d rather be treated   like I’d never left. It makes me feel more... included.                                             Dalia: Alright, fair enough. So with all these years that have passed, what have you been up to? Any accomplishments? Have you founded your own technology company like you said you’d do when you were little?                                                                                             Orion: *Laughs* Not really, no. What about you? I heard you're quite an athlete now.                Dalia: Well, I wouldn't go that far, but yeah, I'm enjoying it.                                     Orion: How did yesterday's run go?                                                                  Dalia: Very well, actually! 9 miles!                                                                Orion: And that's... Um... 12 km? 13 km?                                                            Dalia: *Laughs* I see you went full European and left the “freedom units” behind. Yeah, it's about  15 km.                                                                                              Orion: Impressive!                                                                                  Dalia: Thank you for supporting us yesterday, by the way.                                           Orion: No problem Dalia. I don’t like being the center of attention anyway.                         Dalia: Still, I appreciate it. Thanks!                                                              Orion: (Damn, she looks so different from what I remembered. She used to be so skinny, but now she’s way more... thicc. Maybe one of these days we can go to the gym together. I wonder who can lift    more weight... She seems to have some pretty strong legs. Anyway, all in good time.) Well, today's  my first day! Any tips?                                                                             Dalia: Nah, it's just a regular school… you'll see. But I’ll give you some pointers when we get     there.                                                                                              Orion: Cool! You know, in my previous school we didn't have to wear any uniforms. But I must say,   this one looks cool!                                                                                Dalia: Really? You like them...?                                                                    Orion: You don't?                                                                                   Dalia: Nah... the blazer is pretty stiff and doesn't provide much room for movement, and then the   shirt is way too tight... in certain places.                                                        Orion: I see...                                                                                     Dalia: But eventually, you just end up getting used to it.                                          Orion: I guess I can see how it’d be more uncomfortable for girls.                                  Dalia: Definitely. Anyway, you can take anything you want from the fridge. I think there’s still    some eggs, ham, cheese, and sausages.                                                               Orion: Thanks! Although actually I’m not feeling very hungry right now. I think I'll just take a    sandwich to school.                                                                                 Dalia: Alright, as you wish. There's still some coffee in the pot, if you’d like something to drink instead.                                                                                            Orion: I won't say no to that! Hey! Who's this guy here?                                            Dalia: It's a she! Her name is Carolyn.                                                             Orion: Hey Carolyn! Come here! Do you want to eat breakfast?                                        Carolyn: *Purring*                                                                                  Orion: Is she ignoring me?                                                                          Dalia: *Laughs* She doesn't like you!                                                               Orion: It seems so... Mmmm... There's nothing like a good cup of coffee in the morning. What the... . . . W-What the fuck? That’s your breakfast?!                                                      Dalia: Um... Yes?                                                                                   Orion: Are you gonna eat all that?! All by yourself?                                                Dalia: You bet I will! Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, didn't they teach you that? Orion: *Chuckles* Yeah, but...                                                                      Dalia: This machine needs fuel! If you train like a bear, you gotta eat like a bear.                Orion: Hmm... Fair enough.                                                                          Penelope: *Yawns* Good morning everyone...                                                          Dalia: Good morning, sis!                                                                           Penelope: *Yawns*                                                                                   Orion: Good morning... (Damn...)                                                                    Penelope: Jesus, I can't stop yawning. This damn storm kept me awake all night.                     Dalia: Really? I didn't hear anything. I slept like a baby. Got my full 8 hours!                    Penelope: You lucky thing...                                                                        Orion: (Oh... my... god... Look at that body... I don't remember her this way when she was younger. I can't believe Penelope grew to look like this now... And that outfit? Oh boy, I sure am gonna     enjoy my stay here... I mean, I know they’re pretty much like family, so I don't mean it that way,  but...)                                                                                             Penelope: Is there anything left for breakfast? Or did you eat it all again, Dalia?                 Dalia: Yeah, there’s eggs, ham, and cheese in the fridge.                                           Penelope: Hmm... I'll just have myself a bowl of cornflakes with a side of juice. And a coffee with 3 teaspoons of sugar.                                                                               Dalia: *Laughs* That's what you always eat, I don't even know why you bother to ask if there’s other food.                                                                                              Penelope: Hey, if it tastes good, why eat something else?                                           Dalia: To provide your body with some actual nutrients?                                             Penelope: Meh, as long as it doesn’t have many calories, it's good enough for me.                   Dalia: Do you know how many calories are in 3 teaspoons of sugar?!                                  Penelope: Meh, I make up for that eating salads.                                                    Dalia: *Laughs* Well, tell us! How did the casting go?                                              Penelope: It went terribly. I didn't get it.                                                        Dalia: Aww, sorry to hear that. What happened?                                                      Penelope: Apparently, I wasn't what they were looking for.                                          Dalia: What? And what the hell were they looking for? You have like the greatest body I’ve ever     seen.                                                                                               Penelope: They told me that I was too "voluptuous". And that my breasts were too big! "Sorry miss,  we're looking for a girl with a more natural look." As if I wasn't natural or something. They are a bunch of bozos. It's not my fault that I inherited Mom's breasts. I'll tell you what, these twins   definitely aren’t worth it. They're more of an annoyance than anything else.                        Dalia: It's a pity they didn't take you, sis. But hey, don't worry. There will be plenty of other   opportunities.                                                                                      Penelope: Yeah, I guess. I wish I was still in high school like you. Things were far easier back    then... Anyway, it is what it is. I'll go get dressed, I have to be in class in 30 minutes.         Dalia: Yeah, that's probably a good idea. I don’t think there’s been any blood flow to Orion's brain for quite some time.                                                                               Orion: W-What?                                                                                      Penelope: Huh? ...Orion? . . . ! W-What the fuck, Orion?! You're a fucking pig!                     Orion: I didn't do anything!                                                                        Penelope: I'd forgotten you were even here! Why didn't you say anything during the whole            conversation?                                                                                       Orion: I... I was just thinking.                                                                    Penelope: Yeah, of course. Thinking about what?                                                     Orion: Um...                                                                                        About your body                                                                                     Orion: I was thinking about how I'd love for you to model for me.                                   Penelope: Is that supposed to be a joke?                                                            Orion: Um... yeah, kinda.                                                                           Penelope: Your jokes are fucking disgusting then. Jeez, I feel like I need another shower. See you  later.                                                                                              Dalia: *Laughs* You really put your foot in your mouth this time.                                   Orion: Dammit, I got nervous! This is your fault, Dalia! You...                                     About what you were saying                                                                          Orion: I was just listening to you. To be honest, I'm surprised that you didn't get the job. I mean, it would be absurd to deny that you have a spectacular body. If Gucci didn't want you as their     model, then it’s a huge loss for them.                                                              Penelope: Thanks, Orion. I appreciate it.                                                           Orion: Also, did you mention you have class? May I ask for what?                                    Penelope: I'm studying journalism. I started my junior year about a month ago at the University of  Kredon.                                                                                             Orion: Hey, that's awesome! Maybe you can show me the campus someday. I want to study in Kredon's   college next year too!                                                                              Penelope: Sure, that'd be cool. We'll find some time next week.                                     Orion: Deal!                                                                                        Penelope: Alright, I gotta go now. See you later!                                                   Dalia: *Laughs* Wow, you sure know how to get yourself out of a jam, huh?                           Orion: Hey, I was just speaking the truth, but yeah, I guess I have a way with my words.            Dalia: I see... I'd better remember that...                                                         Orion: *Laughs* The truth is that I'm usually rather clumsy when...                                 About nothing                                                                                       Orion: I’m not thinking about anything. Honestly what you were telling me didn't really interest me, so my mind went blank.                                                                             Penelope: Oh, I'm sorry I bored you, sir.                                                           Orion: N-No, I meant that...                                                                        Penelope: I'm leaving already, don't worry. I don't wanna bore you anymore. See you later.          Dalia: *Laughs* You really put your foot in your mouth this time.                                   Orion: Dammit, I got nervous! This is your fault, Dalia! You... Where... Where's all the food?      Dalia: Hmm? What food?                                                                              Orion: The food you were about to eat.                                                              Dalia: Well, I ate it.                                                                              Orion: Y-You what? You ate it?!                                                                     Dalia: Yeah.                                                                                        Orion: All of it?!                                                                                  Dalia: Yeah.                                                                                        Orion: What the fuck, how is that possible?! Did you even chew any of it?!                          Dalia: Well, actually... no, not much. I usually just gobble it down like a duck.                   Orion: What the... That can't be healthy.                                                           Dalia: Well, I'm used to it. My stomach never hurts and I learned to suppress my gag reflex long    ago, so I can eat a lot in a short time.                                                            Orion: So... you don't have a gag reflex?                                                           Dalia: Nope.                                                                                        Orion: I see... . . .                                                                               Dalia: . . .                                                                                        Orion: . . .                                                                                        Dalia: . . . ? Oh Jesus, tell me you're not thinking what I think you're thinking...                Orion: W-What? I wasn't thinking about anything!                                                    Dalia: You're a fucking pervert.                                                                    Orion: I didn't say a thing!                                                                        Dalia: Yeah, keep dreaming...                                                                       Orion: I wasn't... *Sighs*                                                                          Dalia: Ok, ok, I'm just messing with you. I'll be going. You know where the school is located,      right?                                                                                              Orion: Yeah, I do. By the way... where's Annie? I thought she was here too.                         Dalia: Oh yeah, she was, but she went for a walk. She said she'd be waiting for you by the bridge,  next to the lamppost.                                                                               Orion: Really? In this weather?                                                                     Dalia: That's what I said, but she told us she wanted to take a tour of the neighborhood. She said  this was nothing and that she'd seen more rain in the "Plains of Saturn" server.                    Orion: Oh yeah, that sounds like Annie. I guess she already told you she also plays Eternum?        Dalia: Hell yeah, and she’s an even higher level than me! Can't wait to play with her! We arranged  for a session this weekend. Will you join us?                                                       Orion: Nah, I don't have the neural implant... I don't have enough money.                           Dalia: Aw, I'm sorry. I'd let you borrow mine, but as you know, they’re non-transferable.           Orion: Yeah. It sucks. But don't worry, I've been saving up my cash. I'll be able to join you       soon... I hope.                                                                                     Dalia: Cool! It's incredible, you'll see.                                                           Orion: Yeah, so I've heard.                                                                         Dalia: Well, I'll catch you later, Orion. I'll see you in class.                                    Orion: Sure, see you later! (Alright, I'll finish up my coffee and then I'll go look for Annie.) . . . (No gag reflex, damn... Ahh... the town center. If I'm not mistaken, the university campus is    located beyond that bridge. All those buildings are filled with student apartments. Man, I gotta    crash a college party one of these days. Maybe Penelope could help me with that... Hey, there's     Annie! Hmm? Who the fuck is that guy? Oh, he must be a guy from school, judging by his uniform.     Annie was always good at making friends. I guess I should let them walk to school on their own,     since I don't wanna look like a jealous boyfriend or something. Although... She seems a little      uncomfortable. Yeah, she definitely doesn't look very happy. Is that dude bothering her? Dammit, I'm not sure, they're too far away. I can't make her face out clearly.)                                Be polite to the guy Be aggressive with the guy Ignore it and go to school                          Orion: (Bah, Annie's a big girl. She doesn't need protecting. I'm sure she can handle it. I'll see  her later.)                                                                                         Axel: So... what do you say? Do you want to join us? There will be music, drinks, interesting       people... and much more. Believe me, Kredon can seem like a very boring place until you’re able to  discover it with someone that knows all the hotspots.                                               Annie: T-Thanks for the offer, but I have... things to do after school.                             Axel: *Laughs* Like what? I thought you just got here yesterday.                                    Annie: Y-Yes, I know, but I have to go back home right afterward.                                   Axel: *Laughs* You have to? How old are you? 5? I know you're new around here, but you have no idea how lucky you are right now. The most popular and handsome guy in town is asking you out on a date. All the girls in school would kill to spend an afternoon with me. But I don't want them. I want you, Annie.                                                                                             Annie: Um... Thanks... Axel. Y-You said your name was Axel, right?                                  Axel: Yes. I like that you're so shy, Annie. You're exactly my type. Quiet and compliant. Short and thin... I really like your legs too, you know?                                                      Annie: M-My legs?                                                                                   Axel: Oh yes... *Approaching her* You have very nice legs.                                          Annie: O-Okay...                                                                                    Axel: Do you play any sports?                                                                       Annie: N-No.                                                                                        Axel: You're way too tense, baby. You know what? We should skip school today. Let me invite you to  my place. I have an Olympic-sized, indoor swimming pool.                                            Annie: T-Thanks, but I can't miss my first day at school.                                           Axel: I'll ask the maids to give you a bikini. You can even keep it afterwards, as a gift from me.  Does that sound good? *Groping her* Mmm... You’re even more fit than I thought.  What are your      measurements? We're going to need them for your swimsuit... You have a very small waist, but        generous hips... I'd say... 24-inch waist? 23?                                                      Annie: *Nervous laughter* I d-don't know, I've never measured it.                                   Axel: Oh well, that's not a problem. My maids will measure you. Or... I could do it myself, if you  want.                                                                                               Annie: N-No, thanks.                                                                                Axel: Nonsense... I'll...                                                                           Annie: O-ok, t-that's enough! S-Stop touching me! O-or... Or I'll call the police!                  Axel: *Laughs* The police? Oh my god, you're adorable. I'm a Bardot. My family could buy out the    police if they wanted.                                                                              Annie: I... I d-don't care! I said no!                                                              Axel: *Laughs* I better be careful! Looks like this kitty has got some claws! I always get what I   want in the end, baby.                                                                              Annie: *Gasps*                                                                                      Axel: So why don't we save us both some time and... AAAAARGHH... MY EYE! WHAT THE FUCK?!!! FUCK! IT HURTS! Who's the son of a bitch... Grrrrrr... Who the fuck are you?!                                Orion: The lady said no, buddy.                                                                     Axel: You fucking cocksucker... Do you even know who you just pissed off, you fucking scumbag? Do   you know who my father is?! I'm a fucking Bardot!                                                   Orion: *Laughs* Oh please, tell me you didn't just say that. "Do you even know who my daddy is?"    Axel: Grrr... You just signed your death warrant, motherfucker!                                     Orion: If I were you, I'd go put ice on that eye before it swells and ruins that sweet Bardot face  of yours.                                                                                           Axel: You're fucking dead!                                                                          Orion: (Asshole...)                                                                                 Annie: DON'T TOUCH ME!!                                                                             Axel: *Laughs*                                                                                      Orion: Alright, I think that's enough, buddy.                                                       Axel: Huh? Excuse me? Who the fuck are you?                                                         Orion: The lady said no.                                                                            Axel: You fucking cocksucker... Mind your own business and get lost.                                Orion: I'm not going anywhere.                                                                      Axel: You're pissing me off, and believe me, you don't want to do that. Do you know who my father   is? I'm a fucking Bardot!                                                                           Orion: *Laughs* Oh please, tell me you didn't just say that. "Do you even know who my daddy is?"    Axel: Grrrr...                                                                                      Orion: Get out of here already, prick.                                                              Axel: Alright, you just signed your death warrant, motherfucker!                                    Orion: Whatever you say.                                                                            Axel: You're fucking dead!                                                                          Orion: (Asshole...) Are you ok, Annie?                                                              Annie: Yes, I am, thanks to you! My knight in shining armor...                                      Orion: It's nothing. I've seen guys like him before. Classic bully... all bark and no bite.         Annie: Well, I wouldn't be so sure, he is a Bardot after all.                                       Orion: A Bardot?                                                                                    Annie: William Bardot! He's the largest shareholder of Ulysses, the company that created Eternum! I heard he had a mansion here in Kredon, so... I guess that must be his son. They say he's the man    with the most influence in the company, right behind the Founder himself.                           Orion: Really? Well, who cares. His father might be rich as fuck, but he's just a moron like any    other. There's nothing to be afraid of.                                                             Annie: Oh yeah, I know! All the goons of the town can come challenge us if they want. My own        personal bodyguard Sir Orion will wipe them all out!                                                Orion: *Laughs* Absolutely. I swear undying fealty to thee, m'lady.                                 Annie: Anyway, we’d better head to school before we're late on our first day.                       Orion: True! Let's go! Alright, here we are! (Not gonna lie, I'm a little nervous.) Will you be     alright, Annie? Looks like here’s where we split ways.                                              Annie: Sure! Don't worry about me! I got this. You'd better watch out for yourself when you’re up   there with the big boys.                                                                            Orion: No worries, I’ll manage! See you at home!                                                    Annie: Yeah! I might be a little late because I have to buy a couple of things first, but I'll be   there for dinner. And... thank you again for helping me out back there, Orion. Ciao!                Orion: Later! (Ok Orion, you’ve transferred schools once, and you can do it again. Just act natural and try and fit in. Piece of cake. Ok... If I'm not mistaken, I have to go to floor 4... Class A... Hmm... Looks like I'm one of the first to arrive. I'm not sure if that's good... Ohh... What do we  have here...) Hi! I'm Orion!                                                                        Charlotte: Ugh... Um... I have a boyfriend.                                                         Orion: What? Are you talking to me? I just said hi. I'm new here. I come from...                    Charlotte: *Leaves*                                                                                 Orion: (Um... Ok... Well I’m off to a great start. Typical hot, stuck-up bitch, I guess.) Hey!      What's up, bro? I'm Orion, nice to meet you! Damn, looking pretty ripped dude! Do you lift? Ok...   (What the fuck is wrong with these people? I'm just trying to be friendly and they treat me like I  don't exist or something. Rude... Or maybe I'm invisible and I haven't noticed yet.)                Luna: *Whispering* They can't see you because you're dead, Orion.                                   Orion: *Falling to the ground* AAAAH! HOLY FUCK! WHAT... Who... Who... Who the hell are you?! You   scared the shit out of me! Jesus, one of these days you’ll give someone a heart attack by doing     that... *Getting up off the floor* W-who are you?                                                   Luna: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I'm Luna, nice to meet you.                            Orion: But... How did you know what I was thinking?                                                 Luna: What you were thinking? What? I just saw them ignoring you so I took advantage of the moment. It... it was a joke.                                                                                Orion: But you knew my name!                                                                        Luna: You just said it out loud.                                                                    Orion: Oh... yeah, it's true. I guess it makes sense. (That was a weird way to meet someone, but oh well, she’s kind of cute...) Sorry, I'm new in town, so I'm still a little lost here. I guess I just need some time to adjust.                                                                          Luna: I know what you mean. I've been living in Kredon most of my life and still feel like I don't  fit in.                                                                                             Orion: Really? Well, we can help each other then! Do you wanna sit together?                        Luna: I'm sorry, but I'm not in this class. I'm from class B.                                       Orion: Aww... That's too bad.                                                                       Luna: I actually just came in here to hand out these flyers. So... if you want one.                 Orion: Sure! Give me one. Huh? What language is that? I can't understand any of it.                 Luna: It's in Nhurein!                                                                              Orion: Nu what?                                                                                     Luna: Nhurein. The official language of Eternum.                                                    Orion: Oh... I see. Does it really have its own language? And people speak this Nureim? I've never  played Eternum, I'm sorry if it's a stupid question.                                                Luna: It's not stupid. And no, most players don’t speak it. Only people who take role-play to the   next level. Most people speak English, although there are also some servers where Spanish or Chinese is used. The flyer is basically an invitation to a contest that’s happening this evening at Loco's Cafe. It consists of a few rounds of questions on various topics. It's nothing special, but my      father is the owner of that place, so he asked me to pass out these flyers. Entrance is free, so... well, if you'd like to stop by... It starts at 7:00.                                                Go                                                                                                  Orion: Absolutely, that sounds fun! I'll be there.                                                  Luna: Ok!                                                                                           Orion: But I was wondering... why is the flyer written in the language of Eternum? Especially if    there’s going to be questions on topics not related to the game.                                    Luna: Because of the prize. The winner of the contest will get a brand-new E-3X, the neural implant required to play Eternum.                                                                           Orion: A brand new... E-3X?! THE NEURAL IMPLANT?! T-That shit costs more than $3500!                Luna: Yeah, I won another implant by completing a challenge within the game. Since I already have   one, and my father doesn't want to try it, I thought offering it as a prize would be a good way to  boost the business. It’s only the two of us living together and I couldn't think of anyone else to  give it to.                                                                                         Orion: Well, you could have sold it too and gotten a good chunk of change. I think that’s pretty    kind of you to do this for your dad’s cafe.                                                         Luna: Thanks.                                                                                       Don't go                                                                                            Orion: I'm sorry, I can't. I have... something to do this evening.                                  Luna: Oh... It's okay, don't worry. If tonight is successful, I'm sure we'll do more contests in the future. Well, I have to go. I have some more flyers to distribute before classes start.            Orion: Of course! I won't keep you any longer. Although... before you leave, can I ask you a        question?                                                                                           Luna: Sure.                                                                                         Orion: I just noticed.. How come you're wearing gloves? It's kind of warm outside, despite the      recent rainy weather. My hands would be sweating like crazy!                                        Luna: Oh... It's just... I like them. I... like the feel of silk and velvet, that's all.            Orion: (Oops, she doesn't look comfortable talking about this. Maybe she has some sort of scar or   birthmark on her hands and she's embarrassed about it. I shouldn't have asked.) Of course, haha!    That was a dumb question, I'm sorry.                                                                Luna: It's okay, don't worry. It was nice talking to you, Orion. I'll see you this evening. I'll see you some other day, I guess.                                                                       Orion: Yes! See you later! (Hmm... there’s something mysterious about that girl... Or maybe I’m     overthinking all this and she is telling the truth about enjoying the feeling of silk. Anyway, I    have to win that Eternum E-3X implant! This is the chance I've been waiting for! I'll finally be    able to get my chance to play!)                                                                     Dalia: Well, well, well, did you make a friend already?                                             Orion: *Turning around* Dalia! Yeah, more or less, but she's from class B. All the people I've tried to talk to in this class have ignored me.                                                          Dalia: Yeah, I guess that’s no surprise. Class A is... complicated. 90% of them are assholes or     idiots.                                                                                             Orion: So... there's nothing I can do?                                                              Dalia: Oh, not at all! Some of them can be... useful. You never know when you might need notes from a day you missed, to recruit a player for your basketball team, or to simply ask someone a favor.   But first you need to learn how things work around here. You're lucky you have me!                  Orion: Well, it’s probably just like any other school. I’ll just have to befriend every–            Dalia: Wrong! In Kredon, things are a little different. You see, almost everyone is part of a group here.                                                                                               Orion: Like gangs in a prison?                                                                      Dalia: Yeah! You're getting it already. Now don't interrupt me and pay attention! *Clears throat*   The Jocks. Nothing but a brainless heap of gigantic muscles. The only one with half a brain is      Micaela. She's nice, but she's always beating my records at the gym. Someday I'll beat her... The   Eternum addicts. People call them "Eternumites". They are a bunch of freaks. I mean, I play Eternum a lot too, but I don't come to school dressed up like that. You have to learn to differentiate      between the game and real life. Don't try to talk to them about anything that’s not Eternum. You    won't succeed. The Repeaters. Noah and Raul. Um... I don't know what they do here, to be honest.    They were already here when I started my freshman year, and yet they're still here. They keep       repeating the year over and over again. And... well, that's all I know about them. They have to be  up to something... The Populars. They all suck. They think they're better than everyone else. People love to kiss their ass for some reason and now they think they rule the world because of it. Take  my friendly advice... don't go anywhere near them. They suck. The Brains. If you ever have a math   problem that...                                                                                     Orion: Wait, wait, wait. W-Who did you say that group was again?                                    Dalia: The Brains.                                                                                  Orion: No, not them! Before them!                                                                   Dalia: Ah, the Populars?                                                                            Orion: Yeah! The "Populars"?!                                                                       Dalia: Huh? Didn't you have a popular crowd in your European school? Benjamin, the biggest asshole  in town. He'd do anything to please Axel, including his dirty work. Charlotte, the queen of bitches. All the boys drool over her, but I've seen her changing in the locker room... she ain’t that great, trust me.  *Whispering* She has saggy tits. Axel Bardot, of course, the "leader". He's the son of a big shot from Ulysses, so he's got money and resources to burn. And Chang.                         Orion: W-What? What do you mean "and Chang"?!                                                       Dalia: Huh?                                                                                         Orion: He's my friend! He's the guy who came from the UK with me and Annie... YESTERDAY!            Dalia: Ohh... really? They posted a pic with him on Instagram last night. I assumed he was a new    member of the group.                                                                                Orion: What?! You have got to be kidding me... I'm gonna go talk with him.                          Dalia: You sure? If you get off to a bad start with Axel...                                         Orion: Oh, believe me, I've already met him and I don’t think it can get any worse. I don't give a  shit about that spoiled brat.                                                                       Dalia: *Laughs* Alright then, suit yourself.                                                        Orion: Chang?!                                                                                      Chang: Huh? Oh, Orion! What a nice surprise! What's up, man?                                        Orion: What the fuck are you doing with these guys?!                                                Chang: *Whispering* Ok, ok, not so loud. Keep it cool... I've got a reputation to uphold.           *Whispering* I'm one of the popular kids now.                                                       Orion: *Whispering* B-But... How?!                                                                  Chang: *Whispering* I went for a walk last night and when I got to the bridge, I stumbled upon a    huge piece of graffiti on the wall... it showed a pig fucking a police officer. *Whispering* After I had finished admiring the exquisite detail of it all, I was about to leave when these guys appeared and thought I had painted it. *Whispering* They wanted to take a picture of me and the group in    front of “my work”. Then, once they found out I was new in town, they invited me to join their crew! *Whispering* They think I'm cool, Orion!                                                           Orion: *Whispering* But these guys suck!                                                            Chang: *Whispering* I know, I know! But this is my chance to be popular! Chang the Socialite can    make his debut! *Whispering* Don't ruin it, please!                                                 Orion: *Sighs* Okay...                                                                              Chang: *Whispering* I owe you one!                                                                  Axel: You again...                                                                                  Orion: (Oh shit...)                                                                                 Axel: So you go to our school too, huh?                                                             Orion: No, I just like to wear this uniform to feel pretty.                                         Axel: So funny.                                                                                     Chang: Do you know each other?                                                                      Orion: Yeah, we met before...                                                                       Axel: Are you friends with this douche, Chang?                                                      Chang: Um... Well, yeah, kinda...                                                                   Axel: Then you're out. Don't ever come near us again.                                               Chang: W-What?!                                                                                     Axel: And you better watch out, rookie.                                                             Orion: Go fuck yourself.                                                                            Benjamin: What did this motherfucker just say to you?! Want me to smash your face in, cocksucker?   Axel: Calm down, Benjamin. I'll take care of this little pretty boy... in my own way.               Benjamin: Hah! You're fucking dead, wanker.                                                         Orion: Before you go, can I ask what happened to your eye, Axel? I'm a little worried, that shiner  doesn't look so good. One more and people will mistake you for a raccoon. You should be more        careful, man.                                                                                       Axel: Grrrrr... Who's this cocksucker with the face of a monkey, Chang?                             Chang: Um... he's my friend.                                                                        Axel: I don't like his stupid face. It annoys me.                                                   Orion: Hey, are you the guy who was talking to Annie before? Definitely can’t forget that           middle-aged lesbian hairstyle.                                                                      Benjamin: What did this motherfucker just say?! Want me to smash your face in, cocksucker?          Axel: Calm down, Benjamin. Looks like there's a new clown in town, huh? I'll take care of this      little pretty boy... in my own way.                                                                 Benjamin: Hah! You're fucking dead, wanker.                                                         Axel: Oh, and you're out, Chang. Get out of my face. Both of you.                                   Chang: W-What?! Awww...                                                                             Orion: Shit, I'm sorry, buddy. That was all my fault. I know you wanted to be popular so bad.       Chang: It's okay, Orion, don't worry. I guess I'm not cut out for it.                               Orion: Hey, who needs to be popular anyway?! We have each other! That's all that matters!           Chang: You know what? You're goddamn right, Orion! Chang and Orion – May the bromance never die!    Orion: Hell yeah!                                                                                   Professor Keating: Alright guys, sit at your desks. Class is about to start, and we have 2 new      students joining us today. Please show them that you know how to behave.                            Classmate: Yes, Mr. Keating!                                                                        Orion: (Hmm... I’m not really seeing why Kredon's schools are so well-renowned. I was expecting     something different out here, but everything just seems pretty normal. Boring classes, tedious      exercises, and tiresome homework. Thank god this is the last class of the day.) . . . . . . (The    fuck is wrong with you, Orion? It's just Dalia. You two grew up together! She's practically your    sister... I mean... She's got a nice body, there's no denying it. I'm just proud because all her    hard work in the gym has been paying off. That’s it... only innocent appreciation. Nothing else,    yeah. That's normal... admiring someone else’s hard work through their physique. Not all thoughts   towards another person have to be "sexual" in nature. I'm sure Chang thinks so too.) Pssst!         *Whispering* Chang!                                                                                 Chang: *Whispering* What's up, buddy?                                                               Orion: Have you seen Dalia?                                                                         Chang: Dalia, the girl you live with?                                                               Orion: Yeah. I mean, she's kinda cute, right? And fit too, because of all the time she spends in the gym. She sure has grown up a lot.                                                                  Chang: Dalia? Um... I don't know, she's okay, I guess.                                              Orion: What?! She's just... okay?! Dude, she's fucking hot.                                         Chang: Ohh... so you want to bang her?                                                              Orion: O-Of course not! I'm just merely pointing out that she looks good.                           Chang: I don't know man, she's like a... 6 and a half. Maybe a 7 on a day when I haven’t jerked off. I like my girls more muscular.                                                                     Orion: What?! She's strong as fuck. Have you seen the legs on her? She's totally a fucking 10.      Chang: No way, man. If we’re talking about a true 10, look no further than Micaela.                 Orion: Are you still on that?!                                                                      Chang: Buddy, I'm in love! She's exquisite! The epitome of perfection!                              Orion: No, she's not.                                                                               Chang: Man, I dare you to look at her for 10 seconds, then try to tell me she's not the most        beautiful woman on earth. But only for 10 seconds! Stare any longer and I’ll have to fight you for  ogling my woman. Her flawlessness tells no lies.                                                    Orion: *Sighs* . . .                                                                                Micaela: Huh?                                                                                       Orion: Um... I d-don't see it, buddy. If there’s any sort of feeling I get from her, there’s only   one: fear.                                                                                          Chang: Really? Ok, ok, all to myself then. I wouldn't want to fight you over a girl anyways.        Orion: Nah, that'd never happen, man.                                                               Chang: I know, bro. Hey, you wanna go for a drink later?                                            Orion: Sure thing! A girl from class B invited me to her cafe tonight. They're doing some kind of   trivia contest. You in?                                                                             Chang: Absolutely!                                                                                  Orion: I'll go home to take a shower first, and then I'll call you afterward.                       Chang: Sweet! Sounds like a plan.                                                                   Professor Keating: All right, that's it for today, class. Remember there's a test next week. Don’t  wait until the last minute to study! Cramming is never good!                                        Classmate: Yes, Mr. Keating!                                                                        Dalia: . . .                                                                                        Orion: Hello! I'm home.                                                                             Nancy: Orion!                                                                                       Orion: Hello Nancy!                                                                                 Nancy: How did your first day go?                                                                   Orion: Good enough. Thankfully Dalia was there to give me a couple of helpful tips.                 Nancy: That’s great! I'm glad you two still get along, just like when you were little!              Orion: Definitely! It feels like I never moved and I’m picking up right where we all left off.      Nancy: I'm so glad to hear that.                                                                    Orion: (Holy shit, that sweater looks like it was vacuum sealed. Nancy's boobs are huge...) Damn,   Nancy, you look amazing!                                                                            Nancy: Aw, thank you, honey. You really think so?                                                   Orion: Of course I do! You look more youthful than some of the girls I saw today at school.         Nancy: *Laughs* Now you're going too far.                                                           Orion: Are you going somewhere?                                                                     Nancy: Yeah, I have to do some shopping.                                                            Orion: Cool, I'm gonna take a shower and then I'll be heading out as well. I'm going to have a drink with Chang.                                                                                        Nancy: Sounds good! But before you leave... Can I talk to you about something? It's... a little     embarrassing...                                                                                     Orion: (Oh...) Of course Nancy, anything you want.                                                  Nancy: I've been thinking about it all day. I'm a little ashamed to ask you this, but... I'm sure   it'll bring us much closer... And I feel like it’s naturally the next step for us...                Orion: (Oh my god, I like where this is going...) You know I'd do anything for you, Nancy...        Nancy: Ahh, I’m so relieved to hear you say that... Ta-dah! Family cleaning!                        Orion: W-What? This is what was supposed to bring us closer?                                        Nancy: You said you wanted us to treat you as if you’d never left. And there's nothing like being on chore duty to strengthen a household bond!                                                         Orion: Yeah, thought I heard Admiral Ackbar yelling at me. Should’ve known I was walking into a     trap... I forgot how sneaky you can be...                                                           Nancy: *Giggles* I’ll give you a choice: you can clean either the bathtub or the carpet! You’re not gonna leave poor ‘ol Nancy hanging, are you...? Will you help out?                                  Orion: Um...                                                                                        Yes                                                                                                 Orion: Ok, ok, fine... I guess I'll clean the bathtub.                                              Nancy: I knew I could count on you, Orion! Anyway, I gotta go. I owe you for helping us out, Orion. I won’t forget, I promise!                                                                          Orion: *Laughs* Alright, I'll keep that in mind.                                                    No                                                                                                  Orion: I really wish I could, but I’m running late and need to get going! Chang is probably waiting for me already!                                                                                     Nancy: Mmm... That sounds like a lame excuse to me. But it’s alright, I guess I’ll do it myself     later...                                                                                            Orion: I'm sorry! I'll clean the whole bathroom next week, I promise.                               Nancy: Ok, ok, that sounds a little better. Just don't forget your promise! Anyway, I gotta get     going.                                                                                              Orion: See you later! Take care, Nancy!                                                             Nancy: Bye-bye!                                                                                     Orion: (Hmmm... I'd better hurry or else I'll be late. Let's get this cleaning over with. Alright   then, I'll go change. There's not much else to do here anyway. And done! Time to leave. I'll call   Chang. What the fuck, this bathroom is spotless. How am I supposed to clean something that’s already immaculate?! Hmm... Well now that I’m looking at it closer, I guess there are some lime stains in  the tub. What a drag...)                                                                            Clean it thoroughly                                                                                 Orion: (Hmmm... I should probably do a deep clean. Nancy would appreciate that. They're letting me  and Annie stay in their house after all. This is the least I can do to show my gratitude. Yeah...   I’ll make this bathtub cleaner than it’s ever been. They're gonna lose their minds! Not a single    trace of lime stain will be left standing.) *Imitating Nancy's voice* Oh my god, Orion! How did you get this tub so clean? You've made all of my wildest dreams come true! *Imitating Penelope's voice* Wow, Orion! You did this?! You're sooo amazing! Do you want to celebrate by taking a hot, steamy    bath with me? *Imitating Dalia's voice* Ahh! I can't see! I'm blind! This bathtub is too shiny!     Dammit Orion, you're too good! Can you use those strong, manly arms of yours to show me how you did such an amazing cleaning job?! I can’t promise that I won’t get wetter than this tub will be...     Clean it quickly so you can leave                                                                   Orion: (Meh, I guess I’ll just wipe it down with a cloth really quick and then head out. Nancy won't notice the difference. This is already clean anyway. I’ve got things to do and places to be!       Finally! I'm done! This has gotta be the cleanest bathtub in all of Kredon... And done. It could be cleaner, but oh well... it is what it is.) Huh?                                                     Dalia: *Humming*                                                                                    Orion: (Oh... It's Dalia.)                                                                          Dalia: New record today! 10 minutes flat! Watch out Micaela—that trophy is gonna be mine, baby! Hell yeah!                                                                                              Orion: (I guess she just came back from her daily run.)                                             Get out of the tub                                                                                  Orion: (I should tell her I'm here before the situation gets awkward.) Hey there!                   Dalia: Huh? W-What?! Where the hell did you come from?                                              Orion: I was inside the tub.                                                                        Dalia: Ugh, what?! Were you trying to spy on me?!                                                   Orion: Of course not! How was I supposed to know you were coming in here?! I was getting this tub   squeaky clean.                                                                                      Dalia: Yeah, sure... perv.                                                                          Orion: I wasn’t trying to spy on you!                                                               Dalia: That's what all Peeping Toms say... Now get out of the bathroom!                             Orion: Ok, ok! (Hmm... I wonder what would have happened if I had stayed hidden. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Time to go to the cafe!)                                                                    Stay hidden                                                                                         Orion: (I think it’ll be better if I stay hidden and wait for her to leave. Hopefully she just came in here to grab something really quick. I don’t want her thinking I was trying to spy on her or     anything.                                                                                           Dalia: That was a nice running session. There's still a few days left until Mr. Keating's test, so I can spend the rest of today playing Eternum without feeling guilty! But I'll take a shower first.  Gotta get all this sweat off of me... Dammit, why is there still no lock on this door?! I've asked  Mom dozens of times. I don't mind if she or Penny comes in while I'm indecent, or even Annie. But   Orion lives here too now, so... I better make sure he's not home. Don’t want him getting any free   looks...) Orion!! . . . HELLO?! Is anybody home? . . . (Alright, seems like the coast is clear. My  clothes are all drenched. I’m just gonna throw everything straight into the washer.                 Orion: Oh shit, she took her top off... She must be getting changed... Damn... Holy shit, look at   that ass... You can definitely tell she's been going to the gym. Wow, Dalia is smokin’... Oh lord... is she going to take her underwear off too? Please God of Tits & Ass, if you exist and you're      listening to me, hear my prayers and let me see those goods... Yes! YES!)                           Dalia: *Unhooking her sports bra*                                                                   Orion: (This is happening! THERE IS A GOD. Oh fuuuuck... Sweet, sweet baby Jesus... Look at those   perfectly shaped breasts... Those little pink nipples... Those toned abs... Oh shit, full-on chub   incoming...                                                                                         Dalia: Hmm... Looks like those deep squats are working. My booty is definitely getting bigger! Ass  to grass, baby! And my abs are finally getting more visible too. Even though I eat like a horse.    Guess I can thank my fast metabolism for that. Mmm, this is a nice feeling... getting a little more self-confidence and being comfortable with my body. That's why everyone should start exercising: to love who you see in the mirror and not worry whether other people like you. Not that it's wrong to  want people to like you. I’m not looking to attract the eyes of anyone special, anyways... I mean... Y-Yeah, nobody. N-Not in that way. It’s not like I have the time for that, in any case.            Orion: Oh my god. Is this real life? Oh god, the things I'd do to her right now... And that's...    wrong! Bad Orion! Get a hold of yourself. Man, being under the same roof as 4 women is not going to be healthy for me. I need to get laid soon, or else I'm going to lose my mind... Oh my fucking god, her beautiful ass cheeks shake in such a mesmerizing rhythm... I’m getting hypnotized... I feel like my dick is gonna explode... This is too much... Can you leave already, Dalia?! I need to get out of here! Or maybe... I could have a lil’ wank to relieve the tension.                                 Dalia: I feel stronger than ever. No wonder I'm level 27 in Eternum. Anyway, I think I’ve wasted    enough time in here. Time to take that shower and get clean.                                        Orion: Huh? She's... she's coming this way! OH SHIT! She's gonna use the shower! Of course she's    gonna use the shower, Orion. She's getting naked in the bathroom, what else did you expect her to   do, dumbass?! Oh fuck, she's gonna think I was spying on her! Because that's exactly what you were  doing, idiot! Oh no, now I'm completely fucked! I have to do something! I need to get out of here... I have to disappear, to escape... Must... teleport... Channel my inner powers... Summon the magic  flowing around me... ...focus... and... VANISH!!) Aw shit... I guess I can't teleport. Hmph. Um...  H-Hi Dalia!                                                                                         Dalia: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE?!                                                           Orion: AAAargh... T-This isn't what it looks like!                                                  Dalia: You're a fucking rapist!                                                                     Orion: What?! N-No!!                                                                                Dalia: You were hiding in the bathtub so you could attack me from behind and then rape me!          Orion: NO! God no! I'd never do that!                                                               Dalia: So what then? You're just a perverted creep?!                                                Orion: No that's not true either! I was just cleaning the bathroom, and... Um...                    I fell asleep                                                                                       Orion: Then I fell asleep! I must’ve inhaled too much of the cleaning supplies! When I finally      opened my eyes, there you were standing next to me!                                                 I didn't hear you                                                                                   Orion: Well, I was scrubbing the tub so hard that I didn't hear you coming in. When I realized      someone else was in here too, you were standing next to me!                                         I was stunned by your beauty                                                                        Orion: Then I saw you coming in, and before I knew it, you started undressing. I was so stunned by  your beauty that I froze! I mean... Sorry if it sounds gross, but you simply have the most beautiful body I've ever seen. I didn't even know what to do! When I finally came back to my senses, it was  already too late, and I didn't want to make things awkward. So I decided to wait until you left.    So...                                                                                               Dalia: Do you expect me to believe all that bullshit?!                                              Orion: Oughh... I'm sorry!                                                                          Dalia: GET THE FUCK OUT!                                                                            Orion: Alright alright! I'm leaving! I'm... Arghh! My nose... (Holy shit, she sure knows how to     deliver a kick... That hurt! I hope she doesn't stay upset about this... Anyway, I should really get going. Chang must be waiting for me.) Um... Hi Penelope.                                           Penelope: Why are you on the ground?                                                                Orion: Um... I was uhh... waiting for my turn to use the bathroom.                                  Penelope: Dalia is using it.                                                                        Orion: Ahhh! So that's why the door is closed! Makes sense. *Standing up* Welp! I guess I'll get    going then. I'll just take a shower later.                                                          Penelope: Okay, have fun.                                                                           Orion: Are you okay? You look a little bummed. Oh, hey Penelope! What's up with the long face?      Penelope: Hi, Orion. It's nothing, I'm just a little down because of how yesterday’s casting call   turned out.                                                                                         Orion: Hey, don't worry! I'm sure there will be plenty of other opportunities for you. I mean, look at you! I'm going to grab some food and drinks with a friend, do you wanna come? Maybe that will    cheer you up.                                                                                       Penelope: Thank you, but I can't. I have to take some pictures for tomorrow's Instagram post. If I  don't post one pic every day, I'll lose my sponsor.                                                 Orion: Aw, that's too bad. A girl from school invited us to Loco's Cafe. You’re more than welcome to join us later, if you want!                                                                        Penelope: Oh yeah, now that you’ve mentioned it, I just walked past that place on my way home.      Orion: Do you know of any place nearby?                                                             Penelope: Actually, I just walked past a nice little cafe on my way home. It's called Loco's. A man was handing out flyers at the entrance. I think it was for a contest, and the prize was something   for that game Dalia plays all day, Eternum.                                                         Orion: Exactly! That one! Really?! Damn, that's awesome! I've been dying to get my hands on one of  those neural implants!                                                                              Penelope: You should hurry then, I think they mentioned it starting at 7:00. There were a couple of 4-man teams already preparing, if I'm not mistaken.                                                 Orion: What?! Teams of 4? Fuck, I thought I would be able to participate on my own... I don't have a team! Penelope, I need you! I helped you yesterday! Do me this favor! PLEASE!                      Penelope: Whaaat? Isn't that place like... kinda lame? I can't be seen there... I have a reputation to uphold, Orion.                                                                                   Orion: Eternum isn't lame though! Everyone is playing it!                                           Penelope: Well, in any case, I can't. As I said before, I have to take some photos today.           Orion: You can take pictures there! Eternum is the hottest craze right now! I'll bet that at least  70% of your followers play it. They'll love to see you doing something related to the game. You'll  get... Um... 25,000 likes!                                                                          Penelope: Hmm... Maybe you're right... It seems like the models with most followers are all Eternum cosplayers... And getting 25,000 likes would be pretty awesome... But even if I do join you, we’d   still only have the 2 of us for our team. We’re short 2 other people!                               Orion: My friend Chang will join us. And the 4th... Hmm... Have you seen Annie?                     Penelope: She was going with my mom to do some shopping, or at least that’s what I was told. They   should be back in time for supper.                                                                  Orion: Shit, we're fucked.                                                                          Penelope: What about Dalia?                                                                         Orion: D-Dalia? N-No, better not.                                                                   Penelope: Why? If there are any questions about the game, she'll probably know the answers.         Orion: Um... Y-Yeah, but she asked not to be disturbed because she had to do… something important.  Penelope: Oh, okay...                                                                               Orion: Well, it doesn't matter, we'll just find someone there!                                      Penelope: Hmm... Alright Orion, you convinced me!                                                   Orion: YES! Then let's go!                                                                          Penelope: I have to get changed first! You can start heading over there, I'll meet you inside.      Orion: What's wrong with your outfit?                                                               Penelope: Nothing, but I already posted a pic wearing it. And I had the same hairstyle too! God     forbid I’m seen wearing the same thing twice! *Shudders*                                            Orion: *Laughs* Ok, fair enough. Then I'll go on ahead and reserve a table for us.                  Penelope: Ok! I just need about 10 minutes. I’ll see you there.                                     Orion: Thanks, Penelope!                                                                            Penelope: Hmm... should I pin my hair up? Or braid it? I guess I could do a ponytail? No, maybe a   bun..?                                                                                              Orion: (Okay, I'm ready. Let's go. That neural implant will be mine! Hmm... It looks pretty nice    here. I guess I'm in the right place. Oh, I am. There's Chang.) Hey, buddy!                         Chang: Huh? Orion! Finally! I thought you'd forgotten about me.                                     Orion: Sorry man, I got caught up on the road. We aren't too late, are we?                          Chang: No, I think we’re still good! I'd have signed up for the contest already, but we’re required to have a team of 4 first.                                                                          Orion: No worries, I have it covered.                                                               Chang: Alright then, go speak with the owner!                                                       Orion: On it! Hi! Mr...                                                                             Mr. Hernandez: Hernandez.                                                                           Orion: Nice to meet you! I was told there’s a contest going on, and the prize was Eternum's E-3X.   Mr. Hernandez: You were told right. We were just about to start. Looks like there are 2 teams       already.                                                                                            Orion: Sweet! I wanna join too!                                                                     Mr. Hernandez: Alright, I just need the names of all your team members.                             Orion: Um... It’ll be Orion, Chang, and Penelope, but we’re actually short one person...            Mr. Hernandez: Oh... Well, I'm sorry kid, but rules are rules. You need to find a fourth player.    Orion: Aw shit...                                                                                   Luna: I'll play with them.                                                                          Orion: Huh? Luna! It's so nice to see you here!                                                     Luna: Yeah, I always come here after school to help out my father however I can.                    Orion: That says a lot about you.                                                                   Luna: I thought you’d mentioned you weren't coming.                                                 Orion: Well, that was before discovering the prize for winning was access to Eternum!               Luna: Oh... yeah, fair enough.                                                                      Mr. Hernandez: Are you sure, princess? I thought you needed to head out.                            Luna: Yes, don't worry Dad. I wanna participate in the contest too. It could be fun.                Mr. Hernandez: But you already have one of these things at home.                                    Luna: I know. If we win, this one would be for Orion.                                               Orion: Thank you, Luna! You're the best!                                                            Mr. Hernandez: Alright then, seems like you’ve got your 4-person team and you’re all set!           Orion: Yes!                                                                                         Luna: I'm gonna head to the kitchen to clean the remaining glasses really quick. I’ll be right back.Mr. Hernandez: Okay, sweetie. Thank you. Well, I was just about to mention that the contest is free to join, but it’d be really appreciated if each person ordered at least one drink.                  Orion: Of course! I'll have a vanilla latte with two brown sugars. And... Is that carrot cake I see?Mr. Hernandez: Yes, it is! I made it myself.                                                        Orion: Awesome! I'll take a piece of that too, please.                                              Mr. Hernandez: Coming right up!                                                                     Orion: Thanks, sir! You have a really nice cafe, by the way.                                        Mr. Hernandez: Thank you. I opened it with my wife, over 15 years ago. I used to be a world         traveler, you know? Consumed by wanderlust! But as soon as I visited the United States, I ended up  falling in love with a pale, skinny Yankee. Before I knew it, I was married, had a daughter, and    turned into the proud owner of a cafe! I kissed my traveling days goodbye.                          Orion: *Laughs* I'm sure you don’t have any regrets, though!                                        Mr. Hernandez: Not one bit. Luna is the best thing that has ever happened to me. Her mother passed  away when she was only 5 years old. While my wife was on her deathbed, I made her a solemn promise  that I'd take care of Luna for the rest of my days. *Clears throat* But okay, enough of that mushy  stuff! I’m getting sidetracked here. Please take a seat, we're about to begin.                      Orion: Yes, sir!                                                                                    Penelope: Hey there!                                                                                Orion: Penelope! Wow, you look so different! I love your hair! And your outfit looks great!         Penelope: Why, thank you. I just chose the first thing I saw in my closet, nothing too fancy. And as for my hair... yeah, I guess I did spend a little extra time on it. I love trying out different    hairstyles. You’ll hardly see me with the same one 2 days in a row. Gotta keep my followers         engaged.                                                                                            Orion: Well, you could leave home without doing your hair or wearing any makeup, and I know you'd   still look amazing.                                                                                 Penelope: *Laughs* Yeah, if you say so... Thanks, Orion. Anyway, let's go ahead and play this game  of yours. Shall we?                                                                                 Orion: Sure! I'll introduce you to Chang and Luna, follow me.                                       Cassian: OH MY GOD! You're Penelope, right? "miss_penny" on Instagram?                              Penelope: Um... Y-yeah, it's me.                                                                    Cassian: WOW! I'm your biggest fan!                                                                 Orion: (This guy is in one of my classes, I think. He's one of the "Eternumites".)                  Cassian: I knew you had studied in our school before, but I didn't know you were still living in    Kredon!                                                                                             Penelope: Well... here I am!                                                                        Cassian: Do you usually come to this cafe? Do you have a boyfriend?                                 Penelope: *Awkward laugh* Um... No, it's the first time.                                            Orion: (Hmm...)                                                                                     Cassian: And as for a boyfriend?                                                                    Penelope: Erm... No, I don't have time for one.                                                     Cassian: Ah, I see...                                                                               Orion: (Why did I feel so relieved when she said that?)                                             Cassian: Would you mind if I took a picture with you?! I wanna show it to my friends!               Penelope: Yeah, sure, no problem.                                                                   Orion: (Wow, he's treating Penelope like a celebrity. Is she really that popular? I think it's about time I created an Instagram account. Then I could check out her profile, too.)                     Cassian: Oh boy! I can't believe I’m actually meeting you in person! Best day ever! Can I hold you  by the waist?                                                                                       Penelope: Um... No, I'd rather you not, please.                                                     Cassian: Come on... don’t be shy... Just let me grab a little... Come on... don’t be shy... Just let me grab a little...                                                                                Say something                                                                                       Orion: HEY!                                                                                         Cassian: W-What?!                                                                                   Orion: What's up, Mr. Handsy-man? Didn't she tell you not to do that?                               Cassian: Y-Yeah, I know, b-but... Sorry, I’m just trying to make this moment extra special. It's not every day you get to meet the "Best tits on Instagram".                                            Orion: Yeah, okay, you’ve had enough. Go on and get handsy in your own pants and leave us alone     already.                                                                                            Cassian: S-Sure, sorry. Nice to meet you, Penny!                                                    Orion: Jeez, what a guy. Does this happen to you a lot?                                             Penelope: Not too often, but... sometimes. Thank you, though. I appreciate that you said something  to him.                                                                                             Orion: No problem, it was nothing. I'll be your personal bodyguard from now on, so you won't have to worry about stalkers or people getting too handsy ever again.                                      Penelope: *Laughs* Thank you, thank you.                                                            Don't interfere                                                                                     Cassian: And one last one! Thank you so much, Penny!                                                Penelope: Um... Y-Yeah, ok.                                                                         Cassian: Can we take another selfie?                                                                Penelope: Maybe later.                                                                              Cassian: Ok!                                                                                        Orion: Jeez, what a guy. Does this happen to you a lot?                                             Penelope: Not too often, but yeah... sometimes.                                                     Orion: It's the price of fame, I guess.                                                             Penelope: If you say so.                                                                            Orion: Alright, let's get settled and go win that damn prize!                                       Penelope: After you.                                                                                Orion: ...And well, I'd like to tell you more about Penelope, but I've only been here for a couple  of days now, so I don't know all her secrets just yet.                                              Penelope: *Laughs* There's not much more to tell. I don't have any secrets, I promise! Very nice to meet you guys.                                                                                      Luna: Nice to meet you too, Penelope and Chang. Thank you for coming to our cafe.                   Chang: It for sure won't be the last time I come here! That cake was some of the best I've ever     eaten!                                                                                              Mr. Hernandez: Attention, please! I hope you all enjoyed your food! Now... it's finally time to     start our cafe’s very first contest of the year! And to make sure we start things off with a bang,  tonight’s prize will be Eternum's neural implant—a device valued at $2,500! Prepare yourselves,     fighters!                                                                                           Orion: *Laughs* This is so cool, Luna. I love how your father got really into the roleplay.         Mr. Hernandez: 3 teams. 9 questions. 3 rounds. 1 winner. Before we begin, each team must designate  one member as their captain. The captain will answer questions on behalf of their team and...       Client: Excuse me, where’s the toilet? I’m afraid I might’ve misjudged a fart.                      Mr. Hernandez: Ehm... it’s the first door on the right.                                             Client: Ah, thank you.                                                                              Mr. Hernandez: You're welcome. As I was saying... the captains will be the ones answering the       questions. Remember the terms that were agreed upon when entering this contest... the captains of   the losing teams will have to come to the cafe for a whole week to wash dishes!                     Cassian: Huh??                                                                                      Orion: What? We never agreed to–                                                                    Mr. Hernandez: LET US BEGIN! Team number 1! Who is going to be your captain?                        Jerry: Me. Jerry. You can also call me "The man who's gonna win this thing and BRING HOME THE       BACON"!                                                                                             Mr. Hernandez: Yeah, no, I'm gonna call you Jerry. Team number 2?                                   Aysha: Myself! Aysha!                                                                               Mr. Hernandez: Very well, Aysha! And team number 3?                                                 Orion: Oh shit, we didn't talk about... . . . It'll be me, I guess.                                 Mr. Hernandez: Alright! The captain of my wonderful daughter's team will be... Orion!               Jerry: I'm sorry, what? Did I hear that correctly? The daughter of the guy who wrote all these      questions is going to be participating? What kind of joke is this? What a scam! This shit is...     Mr. Hernandez: Do you have a problem with that, boy?                                                Jerry: W-What?                                                                                      Mr. Hernandez: Do you have a problem with my sweet daughter, who’d never wish ill on anybody,       participating in this contest?                                                                      Jerry: N-No! I mean, I was j-just saying that...                                                    Mr. Hernandez: Are you going to accuse me of cheating, boy? In my own cafe?                         Jerry: N-No! I didn't mean that!                                                                    Mr. Hernandez: Are you calling my daughter a cheater, then? A liar, perhaps?                        Jerry: No!                                                                                          Mr. Hernandez: You offended me, son. You offended my daughter. No one offends my daughter. Not in my presence. Not. In. My. Cafe.                                                                       Jerry: I DIDN'T MEAN TO!                                                                            Luna: It's okay, Dad. I'm not offended.                                                             Mr. Hernandez: Huh... You're lucky that she's a good and pure soul, Jerry. She forgives you for your foolishness. Next time though... Next time I won't be as kind as she is. Don’t let there be a next time, Jerry. I suggest you watch carefully what escapes out of that flappy mouth of yours.          Jerry: O-O-Okay!                                                                                    Mr. Hernandez: Have I made myself sufficiently clear... ...Jerry?                                   Jerry: *Gulp* Y-Yes!                                                                                Mr. Hernandez: Good. Well alright, ladies and gentlemen! That does it for our introduction! Let's   begin! We're running a little late, so we'll have to speed it up a bit! Orion, are you ready?!      Orion: Ready, sir!                                                                                  Mr. Hernandez: Aysha, ready?                                                                        Aysha: Readier than ever!                                                                           Mr. Hernandez: Minus50pointsayswhat?                                                                Jerry: What?                                                                                        Mr. Hernandez: *Laughs* Oh goddammit, Jerry, not much of a street-wise man, I see. You’re not off to a very good start.                                                                                 Jerry: W-WHAT?!                                                                                     Mr. Hernandez: Ok, we'll begin with rounds of three questions. Orion, you go first!                 Orion: *Serious voice* I'm ready.                                                                   Mr. Hernandez: First question: Which celebrity became the first person to reach 100 million         followers on Twitter?                                                                               Orion: Twitter? Does he mean “X”?                                                                   Penelope: I think it was rebranded as “BananaFloopExtremeZ” some time ago, then changed back to “X”, and finally reverted to its original name “Twitter” last month. But... to be honest, I'm not sure. I don't use it much. But I suppose it should be... an athlete, perhaps?                             Luna: Seems very likely. Or... maybe a singer.                                                      Orion: Hmm... yeah, it could be a singer as well...                                                 Chang: A singer that’s also hot! They always get way more plays!                                    Cristiano Ronaldo                                                                                   Orion: It’s gotta be... Cristiano?                                                                  Mr. Hernandez: That is incorrect! I'm sorry, Orion!                                                 Orion: Aw, dammit.                                                                                  Justin Bieber                                                                                       Orion: It has to be... Justin Bieber?                                                               Mr. Hernandez: That is incorrect! I'm sorry, Orion!                                                 Orion: Aw, dammit.                                                                                  Elon Musk                                                                                           Orion: It must be... Elon Musk?                                                                     Mr. Hernandez: That is incorrect! I'm sorry, Orion!                                                 Orion: Aw, dammit.                                                                                  Katy Perry                                                                                          Orion: Could it be... Katy Perry?                                                                   Mr. Hernandez: That is... correct!                                                                  Penelope: Nice job, Orion!                                                                          Orion: Phew! At the last second, I remembered I read that somewhere...                              Mr. Hernandez: Alright, second question. The demolition of the Berlin Wall, separating East and West Germany, began in what year?                                                                       Luna: Ah, that’s an easy one.                                                                       Penelope: Yeah, thank god. Come on, Orion, go for it.                                               Orion: Um...                                                                                        1988                                                                                                Orion: 1988?                                                                                        Mr. Hernandez: That is incorrect! The correct answer is 1989!                                       Jerry: *Laughs*  Nice job, dumbass!                                                                 Chang: What the fuck, Orion...                                                                      Orion: I bet you didn't know that either!                                                           1989                                                                                                Orion: 1989?                                                                                        Mr. Hernandez: That's the correct answer! 100 points for Orion's team!                              Orion: (Oof, thank god I knew that.)                                                                1990                                                                                                Orion: 1990?

Chang: What the fuck, Orion...

Chang: What the fuck, Orion...                                                                      Orion: I bet you didn't know that either!                                                           Mr. Hernandez: Last question of this round! What is Mel Gibson's middle name?                       Orion: Damn, I have no idea. I guess we'll have to shoot blind with this one.                       Chang: It's Bruno!                                                                                  Orion: Bruno? Really? Are you sure?                                                                 Chang: I've never been more sure of anything in my life! I’m 100% positive!                         Orion: Alright then.

Orion: YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID IT WAS FUCKING BRUNO!                                                Chang: S-Sorry! I got mixed up!

Orion: Holy shit, they haven't missed a question! They're better than I thought.                    Mr. Hernandez: Okay, back to Orion's team. Orion, what is the diameter of the Earth? Rounded numbers are accepted!                                                                                      Luna: Oh, I know this... Isn't it like... 7000 miles?                                               Penelope: Hmm... I'd say 9000 miles.                                                                Chang: You know... I'm pretty sure it was a couple of million miles. I just saw it on the Discovery Channel last week. I'm 90% sure.                                                                    7000 miles (11,300 km)                                                                              Orion: 7000 miles?                                                                                  Mr. Hernandez: Ahh! Close, but not close enough!                                                    Orion: Dammit!                                                                                      8000 miles (12,900 km)                                                                              Orion: 8000 miles?                                                                                  Mr. Hernandez: Mark that as another correct answer! 100 points for Orion!                           Orion: Yes!                                                                                         9000 miles (14,500 km)                                                                              Orion: 9000 miles?                                                                                  Mr. Hernandez: Ahh! Close, but not close enough!                                                    Orion: Dammit!                                                                                      A couple of million miles (3,218,688 km)                                                            Orion: 2 million miles?                                                                             Mr. Hernandez: *Laughs* What? That's incorrect!                                                     Orion: Dammit, Chang...                                                                             Mr. Hernandez: Next question: How long does it take for a body to decompose, leaving behind nothing but bones?                                                                                          Orion: Oh, tough one.                                                                               Luna: 1 month and 14 days.                                                                          Orion: Nice! *Laughs* I'm not sure if I should ask, but... how do you know that, Luna?              Luna: Yeah, I think you’d be better off without knowing...                                          Orion: *Laughs* Now I definitely wanna know! You were very precise in your answer!                  Luna: Well, if you insist... My Dad and I killed a man before.                                      Orion: *Stops laughing* W-Wait, what?                                                               Luna: My father won't tell you about this, but I had a sister once. Madeleine.                      Orion: Are you serious?                                                                             Luna: It happened shortly after my mother died. A man broke into our house and found poor Madeleine, sleeping soundly in her bed. He murdered her in cold blood, then God knows what else he did        afterward... He was about to escape when my dad caught him. Enraged after discovering what the      intruder had done, my father beat the man to death and brought him down to our basement. I found my father crying next to the intruder’s corpse. He couldn't afford to go to jail because then I        would’ve been sent to an orphanage. And we couldn’t figure out a way to get rid of the body without possibly getting exposed. So we just left it there... down in the basement. After Madeleine’s       funeral, my father and I tried to continue living our lives normally, but we could never shake the  thought of the intruder’s body that still remained in our basement. Every day after school, I used  to go downstairs to see him. I was... fascinated, to say the least. The back of his head was busted open. There was blood everywhere, but at that point it was all dried up. I was able to see the whole process of decomposition first-hand... First, rigor mortis sets in. After approximately 72 hours,  internal organs begin to decompose due to cell death. The body starts emitting pungent odors. Then  rigor mortis subsides. As the organs continue to decompose, bodily fluids leak from all orifices and the skin turns to a greenish color. Ten days after death, the body turns from green to red as the  blood decomposes and gases accumulate. At the 2 week mark, teeth and nails fall out. One month, the corpse begins to liquify into a dark sludge. At 1 month and 14 days post-mortem... only the bones   remain. After that time had passed, we ground the intruder's bones into dust, and then threw it into the river. After 2 months, all that was left... Was a faded stain on the floor, and the memory of a sister who was never going to come back...                                                         Orion: Is t-that... *gulp* Is t-that t-true, Luna?                                                  Luna: Not really. It was only a joke.                                                               Orion: Oh, thank god...                                                                             Chang: I almost shit my pants...                                                                    Luna: I've never had a sister. And our house doesn't even have a basement. I only know all that     because I’ll sometimes watch crime investigation shows on TV.                                       Orion: I guess I still have to get used to your "jokes"...                                          Mr. Hernandez: Orion? Do you know it, or not?                                                       Orion: Y-Yeah, sorry!                                                                               1 month and 14 days                                                                                 Orion: 1 month and 14 days.                                                                         Mr. Hernandez: That is... absolutely correct!                                                       Orion: Yeah! Nice job, Luna!                                                                        2 months and 7 days                                                                                 Orion: 2 months and 7 days.

If we wanna win this whole thing, it looks like Jerry’s team is the one to beat. We can do it!                                                                   Mr. Hernandez: Ok, Orion, last round! How long does Mercury take to revolve around the sun?         Orion: Holy shit, who the fuck knows that?!

Mr. Hernandez: That could not be... anymore correct! Well done!!                                    Orion: Wow! I wasn't expecting that! I'm impressed.                                                 Penelope: What do you mean by that? The big titty blonde has to be the typical, airheaded bimbo??   Orion: No! I mean... You are very knowledgeable, that's all I'm saying. Definitely more             knowledgeable than myself, that’s for sure.                                                         Penelope: Well, thank you. Sorry for getting all defensive, sometimes guys assume that I'm nothing  but a brainless barbie simply because I want to be a model.                                         Orion: Well, I definitely do not share that opinion at all.                                         Penelope: Yeah, I know. Thanks for trusting me, Orion.

Penelope: Well jeez, thanks for trusting me...                                                      215 days                                                                                            Orion: Um... 215 days.

Orion: You haven't given one correct answer this entire time!                                       Chang: But this time I'm sure of it! I read that fact in a game! Trust me, bro! Believe in our      friendship! BELIEVE IN ME!

Chang: I always knew that playing games all day was eventually going to prove useful!               Mr. Hernandez: Okay guys, this is your last question! Our final topic will be... Eternum! Who's the largest shareholder of Ulysses, the company behind the game?                                        Orion: Oh fuck, I know this one! Annie told me about him! Axel's father!                            Luna: Hmmm... I know a lot about the game, but not about the company itself... I have no idea.      Penelope: Hmm... I can't help you with this one either, I'm afraid.                                 Orion: It's on the tip of my tongue... It was...

Mr. Hernandez: Now, your final question will be about Eternum as well! What is the largest recorded number of online players in the game’s history?                                                     Aysha: Ok, Eternumites... assemble! *Whispering* We have to know this. I think it was 25 million    users. It happened last month, during the One Punch Event.                                          Cassian: *Whispering* You sure? I think it was more. *Whispering* Weren’t like... 40 or 50 million  people logged in at one point during the lockdown?

Jerry: Nephrology.                                                                                  Mr. Hernandez: Correct! How many permanent teeth do dogs have?                                      Jerry: Um... 30?                                                                                    Mr. Hernandez: Wrong!                                                                               Kimberly: I knew that one! You need to consult with us before answering!                            Jerry: Shut up, Kimberly! I'm gonna win this shit myself! Come on, what's the last question?        Mr. Hernandez: In Eternum, where was the 3rd Gem of Doom found?                                     Jerry: Fuck... It was in... The Temple of Amun'Ra?                                                  Mr. Hernandez: Oh, Jerry... I'm afraid that is incorrect... What a pity...                          Jerry: Impossible!                                                                                  Mr. Hernandez: Well, regardless, the contest is now finished! Ladies and gentlemen... We have       ourselves a winning team!                                                                           Jerry: Oh shit, already? How many points did we have? Did we win?                                   Mr. Hernandez: The winner is... Jerry’s team...                                                     Jerry: HAHA! Of course. Suck it, losers! That neural implant is MINE! Give me my prize!             Orion: Oh fuck, we lost?! No! This can’t be happening! I don’t think I’ll ever get a chance like    this again... This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! And we fucking lost! Now I'll never be able to play Eternum! Time to put myself out of my misery.                                              Penelope: Orion, dont!                                                                              Orion: Goodbye, cruel world! I'LL SEE YOU ALL IN HELL!                                              Penelope: No!                                                                                       Orion: And that is probably what would happen if we don't win this contest.                         Penelope: What, you'll kill yourself? How? You don't even have a gun. Aren't you being a little     over-dramatic?                                                                                      Orion: Well, maybe a bit, but it doesn't matter because I know we're gonna win this contest! LET'S  GO, GUYS!                                                                                           Mr. Hernandez: Orion’s team!!!                                                                      Orion: What? Oh fuck, we won?! OH HELL YEAH!                                                        Jerry: Man, let's get out of here. *Whispering* What a scam.                                        Mr. Hernandez: Congratulations, Orion!                                                              Orion: Thank you so much, sir!                                                                      Mr. Hernandez: I'm really happy it's your team that won. And not just because my sweet daughter is  on your team. I just wasn’t a fan of that Jerry guy.                                                Orion: *Laughs* Yeah, me either, to be honest.                                                      Mr. Hernandez: Alright, here's your prize!                                                          Orion: Wow!                                                                                         Mr. Hernandez: The E-3X is inside this package. It’s all unopened, so everything you need to get    started will be there as well. Try not to play too much!                                            Orion: I'll try! Damn, Chang, I wish more than 1 person could use a neural implant. I’d share with  you in a heartbeat! I swear I'll pay for yours when I get the money!                                Chang: It's ok, man. I know you've been looking forward to it for years. You don't owe me anything. It's all yours.                                                                                     Orion: Thank you so much bro, you're the best!                                                      Mr. Hernandez: Well, I need to start closing the cafe. Don't forget your prize!                     Orion: I won't!                                                                                     Luna: Goodbye, Orion. And congrats! I'll see you at school.                                         Orion: Luna!                                                                                        Hug her Give her space                                                                              Orion: Thank you so much! This truly is a dream come true! I couldn’t have won without you! Thank   you, thank you, THANK YOU!                                                                          Luna: It's nothing...                                                                               Penelope: Do you mind if I post a pic of this cafe on my Instagram account? I took a really nice one at the entrance, right next to the lamppost. The extra publicity could help bring in a few         clients.                                                                                            Mr. Hernandez: Of course! We'd be honored. From what I saw, it looks like you're pretty             Instagram-famous.                                                                                   Penelope: *Giggles* Well, I wouldn't go that far! But thank you! Alright, let's go home, Orion! The others must be wondering where we are.                                                              Orion: Yeah, let's go! Goodbye, Mr. Hernandez!                                                      Mr. Hernandez: Take care, Orion. Well, the first contest at Loco's Cafe was definitely a hit! I had a lot of fun. That Orion seems like a nice guy, doesn't he? Is he a friend of yours?                Luna: N-No. I mean... I don't know. I just met him today. He's new at school. At least he doesn't   call me a weirdo like everyone else. Anyway, I'm gonna go finish cleaning up in the kitchen.        Mr. Hernandez: *Chuckles*                                                                           Orion: Everything was delicious, Nancy! Your food is just as amazing as I remember!                 Nancy: Thank you, honey! But I didn’t do anything special.                                          Orion: I don't know, it felt pretty special to me. I never had a nice, home-cooked meal when I was  living with my dad.                                                                                 Nancy: *Laughs* I guess that makes sense.                                                           Orion: Let me help you clean up the dishes.                                                         Nancy: There's no need, don't worry. You can go play Eternum now, if you want. I bet you can’t wait!Orion: Nah, I can't. It takes about 10 to 15 hours to download all the game files. Although... to be honest, it's probably for the best. I'm pretty tired today. I'll settle for a good night’s rest    tonight and then tomorrow after school, it’ll be ready to play!                                     Nancy: Ah, that sounds like a solid plan! You must be excited to play with him, Annie.              Annie: THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE! "Excited" doesn’t even begin to describe how I feel right   now! This is the best news I’ve gotten since I was able to start playing myself! I can’t wait to    have someone else to play with! Tomorrow you'll finally be connected to Eternum, Orion! After       waiting for so many years! Aren't you excited?!                                                     Orion: *Chuckles* To be honest, yeah, I'm pretty damn excited! I'm counting down the hours until    tomorrow!                                                                                           Annie: Now there will be 3 of us playing Eternum—Orion, Dalia and me! We’re only missing Nancy and  Penelope, then our group would be complete!                                                         Penelope: *Laughs* I wouldn't count on it, Annie, sorry. I've never played video games before, and I just have too much on my plate to start anytime soon.                                              Nancy: Well, hanging out at a cafe and participating in a trivia contest doesn’t sound like your    typical realm either, and yet, you were there Penny.                                                Penelope: Well, that's different... Orion convinced me to join and help him... But I’ll admit that I did have a lot of fun. Between dealing with college coursework and modeling... I’ve been pretty    stressed. It was a nice breath of fresh air. Thank you for pushing me out of my comfort zone,       Orion.                                                                                              Orion: No problem, Penelope. Thank you for helping me!                                              Penelope: Maybe we can do it again sometime. Hmm, maybe next time I'll bring you to one of "my      places".                                                                                            Orion: Sounds like a plan to me!                                                                    Nancy: Alright guys, I think Orion was on the right track earlier. Everyone should start getting    ready for bed. You all went to sleep pretty late yesterday, and it’s still a school night.          Annie: But I can't sleep! I need to prepare all the things I want to show Orion tomorrow! I'll start off by showing the server of Mikaar! No, no! Ion! Definitely Ion! And then I can introduce you to  Kitty! Oh man, maybe we can complete your first dungeon!                                            Nancy: And what about you, miss? You've been quiet all throughout dinner. Someone must be excited to play Eternum with Orion too!                                                                       Orion: . . .                                                                                        Dalia: . . .                                                                                        Orion: (It looks like she's still upset about what happened before...)                              Nancy: Dalia? Hello?                                                                                Dalia: Hmm? What?                                                                                   Nancy: Orion finally won an implant to play Eternum!                                                Dalia: Wow, seems like Orion did a lot of things today.                                             Nancy: Huh? What else did he do?                                                                    Dalia: I don't know, Orion, are you proud of anything else that you’ve done today? Would you like to share with the table?                                                                              Orion: Um... N-No, nothing comes to mind...                                                         Dalia: Of course... Can't wait to play with you tomorrow, Orion. I'll bring you to my favorite      server.                                                                                             Orion: (The way she said it, it almost sounded a little threatening...) C-Can't wait.               Dalia: Anyway, I'm off to bed. I'm pretty tired. *Yawns* Night guys.                                Annie: Goodnight Dalia!                                                                             Nancy: Good night, darling.                                                                         Penelope: Well she looked a bit upset... even more so than usual. I wonder what happened...         Nancy: Don't worry about it. I remember when I was a teenager... my emotions were all over the place too. Whatever it is, I’m sure she'll be over it by tomorrow.                                       Orion: Y-Yeah, sure.                                                                                Nancy: But she had a good idea.                                                                     Dalia: Yeah, sure, sounds good. *Laughs* Can't wait to kick his ass in the game. And sorry about    being so quiet, I'm just very tired. Actually, I'm off to bed. *Yawns* Night guys.                  Nancy: Yeah, I think that's a good idea. We should all go to sleep now. Or at least... head to our  rooms.                                                                                              Annie: Sure!                                                                                        Penelope: Yeah, you're right. It is pretty late.                                                    Nancy: But before we call it a day... We have to decide who's on dish duty tonight! The council of  sponge and soap has made its selection... today, they have chosen... Penelope!                      Penelope: Whaaaat? Again?!                                                                          Nancy: What do you mean "again"?! Dalia washed them on Sunday, I did it the day before yesterday,   and Annie offered to do it last night!                                                              Penelope: Oh, really? Wow, time sure flies by.                                                      Annie: I can do it again, if you want! It’s not a big deal.                                         Penelope: Nah, don't worry Annie, it's my turn today. But thank you!                                Orion: (Holy shit, Penelope sure has a killer body. She has huge boobs, but her ass isn't slacking  either... And is it just me, or has Annie gotten more curvy lately? I mean, she's still petite like always, but now I’m noticing her nice, peachy butt... She looks more fit too! I wonder if she's been working out... And don’t get me started about Nancy... holy shit. Look at those tits... I think    they are even bigger than Penelope's... and that’s quite a feat... I... Oh shit, I'm getting too    excited. I'm... Oh no. Boner incoming. What the fuck is wrong with me?! I'd better get going before I start lifting this table without hands...) Um... I'm off to bed, girls! Goodnight!                Annie: Goodnight Orion!!                                                                            Nancy: Sleep tight, honey!                                                                          Penelope: Night-night!                                                                              Orion: (Man, I've been way too horny lately... I have to find a girlfriend ASAP, otherwise I'm gonna go crazy. But I’m not gonna find one in this house! I need to start thinking with the head above my shoulders and not the one between my legs. Hmm, maybe I could date someone from school... There    aren't many hot chicks in class A, though... There's only Dalia, then that uptight bitch who's      friends with Axel, and... Hmph. Can’t think of anyone else.) *Sighs* (I'm fucked... if I don’t get a release anytime soon then I guess I’ll just implode. Maybe I should focus on my studies and forget about girls until I’m finished with this semester. And hey, on the bright side, by this time        tomorrow I'll be playing Eternum! Yeah, that's right! I don't have time for girls right now.)       *Yawns* (Mm-hm, sounds like a plan... God, I'm so sleepy...)                                        Nancy: Orion!                                                                                       Orion: AAAAARGH!!! You have to stop doing that!                                                     Nancy: Haha, sorry!                                                                                 Orion: What's the matter?!                                                                          Nancy: I just wanted to let you know that I'm really happy with how well you cleaned the bathroom   earlier! The tub is so shiny! I haven’t seen it that clean since we first bought the place!         Orion: Oh! Thanks! I put a little extra elbow grease into it. After all, you're graciously letting  me and Annie stay here and you’re sharing your food with us too! I know it doesn't come close to    making up for it, but I'll try to help you out as much as I can.                                    Nancy: Thank you, Orion! I'm proud to see the good boy you've become.                               Orion: It's... it's nothing, really.                                                                Nancy: I didn’t know what to expect when meeting you again, but I can see you're still as sweet as a piece of candy.                                                                                    Orion: (Oh god, this is not helping...) T-Thank you, Nancy.                                         Nancy: Ok then, I won't bother you anymore. Good night, honey.                                      Orion: You have to stop doing that!                                                                 Nancy: Haha, sorry.                                                                                 Orion: What's the matter?!                                                                          Nancy: I went to the bathroom and saw that poor excuse for “cleaning” that you did, mister. I just  came to remind you that you need to clean the bathroom tomorrow.                                    Orion: Oh... Y-Yeah sorry, I was in a bit of a hurry earlier.                                       Nancy: Yeah, I could see that. You’re gonna need to clean it again tomorrow. And do a better job    this time! I understand, but you'll have to do it tomorrow!                                         Orion: Alright, fair enough. I'm sorry, I'll do it right this time.                                 Nancy: That's more like it! Ok then, I won't bother you anymore. Good night, honey.                 Dalia: Mom, where did you put my toothpaste? Did you throw it away?!                                Penelope: Mom, where's my top? The pink one. You’re not donating my stuff, are you?! I can't find   it!                                                                                                 Nancy: Oh boy, the drama never ends around here! First, neither of my daughters gets kissed by fire and inherits my lovely red hair, and now they can’t seem to keep tabs on any of their belongings!   When will God stop ravaging this family with misfortune?!! Ok, sorry for the interruption Orion—good night!                                                                                             Orion: *Laughs* Good night!                                                                         Nancy: Penelope, the top is in the washing machine. You said it smelled strange yesterday.          Penelope: Ahhh, that's true! I forgot.                                                              Nancy: And Dalia... Come on, the toothpaste is right here! In the drawer, like always! How the hell did you not see that!                                                                               Dalia: What?! That wasn't there before, I swear!                                                    Orion: *Laughs* (Ok, back to sleep.) . . . (Dammit, now I’m not sleepy anymore. I'll watch a couple of videos on my phone until I fall asleep. Hmmm... or maybe I could create an Instagram account to  check out Penelope's profile. What happened with her at the cafe got me kind of curious... I've     never liked using social media, but well, having one account won't hurt. Ok, let's do it.           Username... Orion. Already exists. Bah, I'll just choose a temporary name. I can always change it   later. And now let's find Penelope... There she is! Wow, that’s a really nice picture of her! I must say, she has a very professional-looking account. 11,654 likes and 102 comments... That’s          definitely a lot. No wonder she was recognized at the cafe.) *Scrolling down* (Hey, that looks like the front lawn! Cool photo. And another super sexy outfit. Are my eyes playing tricks on me, or is  that some subtle nipple-action I see? Naughty girl...) *Scrolling down* (Holy mother of God. Look at that body... Wow. Insane. Should I like this photo?)                                               Give it a like                                                                                      Orion: (Yeah, I don't see why not. Man...)                                                          Don't give it a like                                                                                Orion: (Nah, it's probably better if I don’t. Man... Imagine fucking a girl like her... That would  be... I mean... Agh! This is not helping me! Looking at hot pics of Penelope, yeah, great idea,     Orion. Way to not have even more fantasies of all these girls around me... And now my boner has made its comeback. Wonderful.) *Getting your cock out* (Ahh, that's better. I'm hornier than a monkey   with eight dicks. I haven't jerked off since I arrived at Kredon, maybe that's why... Anyway, I     should just forget about it and get some sleep already.) *Yawns* (Just... Forget...) Zzzzzz...      Nancy: Dalia, I'm headed off to work! Has Annie woken up yet?                                       Dalia: *Answering from the kitchen* Yeah, she's in the shower!                                      Nancy: Alright, well have a good day then!                                                          Dalia: *Answering from the kitchen* You too!                                                        Nancy: (I should probably wake up Orion too, or else he'll be late. Although... He asked me to      install a lock on his door last time, and I still haven't done it yet. Maybe I shouldn't risk       invading his privacy again. I'll just get going, he'll probably wake up on his own. I should just   knock this time. Yesterday morning was awkward and I wouldn't want another repeat of that.) Orion!  Good morning! It's time to wake up! Orion? Good morning, sleepyhead! . . . (Really? I can't believe this is happening again! But this time he’s actually hard! It’d definitely be more embarrassing than last time... I can't wake him up now. What would I say? Well, it doesn't matter, I'll just leave.  He'll wake up eventually, I guess. Let's go.) *Leaves* (Jesus Christ, it's huge! I'd have never     guessed he was so well endowed. Who would’ve known he was hiding such a monster... Damn... Why can't I stop looking at it? Please don't wake up now... How long has it been since I last saw one of     these? I definitely know I’ve never seen one this nice before... Jesus, I feel like a teenager      that's seeing a dick for the first time and wondering what that thing is for. Except I know exactly what it's for... Oh my god, that has to feel amazing... I'm getting wet just thinking about it.     Imagine if he woke up, grabbed me, and threw me up against the wall... Then he'd grab me by the     waist, kiss my neck, and slowly slide into me... Only then to fuck me so hard... so deep... Then I'd push him back onto the bed, climb on top, and ride him so fast that he’d... Oh Jesus, one man comes into my house and suddenly I turn into a nymphomaniac. What the hell is wrong with me? I need a    good fuck, so bad. Not Orion, of course, but... I need a cock just like his. A big, hard... perfect cock... Well of course, I’m only guessing it’s hard, I haven't felt it myself...) *Whispering*      Orion? You there?                                                                                   Orion: Zzzzz...                                                                                     Nancy: (Mmmm... Yep, it's definitely hard. And warm... Oh my god... It's even throbbing... I... I   want to suck it... savor its taste... I want to feel it filling up my mouth... then going down my   throat... I wonder what he would do if I just started stuffing my mouth with his dick... Right      here... Right now... I mean... If Dalia and Penelope never found out, then would it really be so    bad? It’d be our little secret...)                                                                  Orion: Zzzz... Mmmm... Hmm? (Oh shit, why is my dick out? Oh, yeah... I got hard when I was trying  to sleep last night, so I opened my fly. I must’ve been having a good dream... Too bad I can't      remember it... Actually, I hardly ever dream. Anyway, I should get dressed and head to school. Let's go!                                                                                                Nancy: Oh my god, that was close. Come on, Nancy... get a hold of yourself. You should be leaving   for work already... That was weird. I don’t know what came over me. It was also kinda exhilarating, though... I haven’t felt excitement like that in so long...)                                        Orion: Just 1 more hour, Chang! 1 more hour and I'll be playing Eternum! It's been a long day, but  we're almost at the finish line!                                                                    Chang: We should really start studying for next week's exam, though. Especially you... you’re going to be very pre-occupied in the days to come.                                                        Orion: Yeah, it almost seems like Mr. Keating is trying to sabotage me. But it doesn't matter much. The subject isn’t that difficult, so I'll just take a look at it the day before and I’m sure I’ll   get an A like always. I’ll even settle for a B+.                                                    Chang: *Laughs* Goddammit, I’m so jealous of how you always manage to get good grades somehow... I  wish I was as smart as you...                                                                       Orion: I'm not smart... I just have a good memory, I guess. Also, why the fuck is he also here?! Is he the only teacher in the school?!                                                                 Professor Keating: Um... Yeah, guys, swim class is over. You should probably go take a shower and   get back to the fourth floor.                                                                       Classmate: Mr. Keating, do we have to pick this up?                                                 Professor Keating: I don't know Elijah, I'm just filling in for the swim teacher today. You should  ask her when she's back.                                                                            Orion: (Ah, always nice to see a man who goes above and beyond for his job.)                        Chang: You know what, I'll go pick that up. If it starts raining it will get ruined.                Orion: Always thinking about others, huh?                                                           Chang: I'm trying to build up some good karma. Always try helping out other people and the universe will be sure to return the favor.                                                                   Orion: That's a good philosophy! Alrighty buddy, see you in the locker room.                        Chang: See you!                                                                                     Dalia: Well, what did you think of your first swim class here?                                      Orion: Hey Dalia! (Oh my god, I love this school's swimsuit...) It wasn’t too bad! We actually      didn’t have this class at my previous school.                                                       Dalia: Are you any good at swimming?                                                                Orion: Good enough. I’m no mermaid, but enough of a decent swimmer to avoid drowning.               Dalia: Yeah, kind of like me. I prefer sports that take place on dry land. Nothing like doing deep  squats! Ass to grass! Ass to grass!                                                                 Orion: *Laughs* True.                                                                               Dalia: I bet you're super excited to finally play Eternum for the first time.                       Orion: Well, seeing that you're actually speaking to me again makes me even happier. I'm glad you're not still angry with me about what happened yesterday.                                             Dalia: Well, I haven't forgiven you just yet. I still think you're a nasty pervert.                 Orion: I'm sorry about that, Dalia. I’ll make it up to you somehow, I promise!                      Dalia: *Laughs* You better!                                                                         Orion: Sure, I am! Can't wait to play it! So... Annie said she'd help me log in for the first time. Will you join us afterward?                                                                         Dalia: I can't. I have to hit the gym after school. I need to follow a strict exercise regimen if I want to take first place in next week's competition. But maybe we can play a bit after dinner, if   it's not too late.                                                                                  Orion: Sure, sounds good! Real life should always come first. So, if I were to guess, I’d say you’re trying to become the school’s top swimmer too?                                                     Dalia: Nah, impossible. Alex is hands down the best swimmer in our school. And the town. And        probably even the region.                                                                           Orion: Alex?                                                                                        Dalia: Yeah, haven't you seen her? She’s pretty hard to miss.                                       Orion: Huh? Oh, yeah... I think I’ve seen her before. She’s the one that was swimming fast as fuck, right?                                                                                              Dalia: Hell yeah she was. She could probably even compete in the Olympics if she wanted to.         Orion: She chooses not to?                                                                          Dalia: Maybe, I don't know. She pretty much keeps to herself. Sometimes she skips class for a day,  sometimes a whole week! Mr. Keating always yells at her for it, but she doesn't seem to care much.  Orion: Oh, so that's why I didn't see her yesterday... What group is she in? The Jocks? The         Populars?                                                                                           Dalia: She's not in any group. She's a lone wolf.                                                   Orion: Oh, so a bit like you, then?                                                                 Dalia: Hmm... maybe. I don't like being pigeonholed into any "group" either. Maybe that's why we get along.                                                                                             Orion: Oh, so you two are friends?                                                                  Dalia: Well, it's hard to get close to her, but yeah, you could say that.                           Orion: I see...                                                                                     Alex: Hey Dalia. Are you gonna hit the showers?                                                     Dalia: Hi Alex! Yeah, I'm coming. Damn girl, it looked like you were flying on the water today!     Alex: *Laughs* Really? I trained all yesterday. I’m trying to improve my times.                     Dalia: Well, you totally did! *Going down the stairs*                                               Orion: Hi! Nice to meet you! I'm Orion!                                                             Alex: *Leaves*                                                                                      Orion: (Um... I guess she didn't hear me... Anyway, since everyone already left, I should go shower too. Only one class to go and then I'll...) AAArgh... What the fuck... Son of a bitch...            Benjamin: You should be more careful, rookie. No running by the pool. You might fall and break your nose.                                                                                               Orion: This is your doing, isn’t it, Axel? You filthy rat... Did I hurt you that much yesterday? Had to cry to Papa and tell him all about your ouchie eyeball?? Were you so embarrassed that you needed to bring your personal bulldog to intimidate me? 2 vs 1? When no one else is around? And you’ve    gotta attack me from behind? You again? What the fuck do you want? Are you so scared of me that you have to attack me from behind? You're both fucking cowards.                                         Benjamin: *Laughs* Nah, it's not like that. It's just that I don't like your stupid, pretty-boy     face. Or your attitude, strutting around like you’re the king of the world. Someone needs to put you in your place.                                                                                     Orion: Fuck you. You're a pair of scumbags.                                                         Benjamin: You should show some respect when you're talking to Mr. Bardot, you fucking worm. You     better learn quick, otherwise we’re gonna have to keep teaching you a lesson. Be careful, loser.    Orion: Fuck off!                                                                                    Axel: *Laughs* I will make your life miserable. I’ll turn your existence into a nightmare. For both you and your loved ones.                                                                            Orion: Shut the fuck up, dickhead!                                                                  Axel: *Laughs* I almost feel bad for you. You messed with the wrong guy. Take care, Orion.          Orion: *Sighs* (Back in trouble again, Orion... What the fuck is wrong with this guy? I've never    cared much about bullies, but as soon as he mentioned my "loved ones"... I felt a chill down my     spine. I hope he's just a cocky asshole that’s all talk and nothing else... Anyway, I should get    going. I don't want Mr. Keating to give me detention for being late. Not today!)                    Professor Keating: Ok guys, that’s all I’ve got for you. You’re released to go home.                Orion: (Holy shit, finally! This was the longest day ever, but it's finally over!)                  Professor Keating: Oh class, really quick! Before you leave, I need to assign partners for the      project that’s due next week. The last time I let you pair up on your own, it was utter chaos.      Orion: (What a damn buzzkill...)                                                                    Professor Keating: Let's see... Um... Chang with Micaela...                                         Chang: W-What?!                                                                                     Professor Keating: Raul with Noah, Cassie with Aysha, Axel with Benjamin, Dalia with...             ...Charlotte.                                                                                       Dalia: Whaaat? I don't wanna go with her...                                                         Charlotte: Excuse me?! I'm the one who should be complaining, bitch!                                Professor Keating: And Orion with... Um... Alex.                                                    Orion: (Uhh...)                                                                                     Alex: Huh? Who?                                                                                     Professor Keating: Orion. He and Chang are the two new guys. You didn't meet him yesterday because  you missed class... again.                                                                          Alex: Orion? . . . Ahh... Him...                                                                    Orion: . . .                                                                                        Raul: Mr. Keating, we won't be able to complete this project.                                       Professor Keating: What?! Again?!                                                                   Raul: Yeah, Noah and I have something that we can't postpone.                                       Professor Keating: This is unacceptable, guys. If this keeps happening, you guys are gonna end up   repeating this grade again!                                                                         Raul: Meh, what's one more year? We've grown fond of you, Mr. Keating. Anyway, see you next week.   Professor Keating: No! I won't allow it! And what's this "something" that can't be postponed?!      Raul: It's personal.                                                                                Professor Keating: I DEMAND TO KNOW! I m-mean... If you don't want to tell me, it's ok... I...      Raul: Noah's mom is coming to the city.                                                             Noah: Yeah, I... haven't seen my... mom... for a very long time, Mr. Keating. We have to pick her up at the harbor.                                                                                     Professor Keating: Oh... T-That's g-great. You can do the p-project another day then. N-No problem. F-Family comes first.                                                                               Noah: Good.                                                                                         Raul: We'd also appreciate if you could keep this information to yourself.                          Noah: My momma is a very shy and reserved woman, Mr. Keating. She doesn't like the craziness of     daily life. And she definitely doesn't like Americans. American police, to be more precise. They’re on par with snitches—she believes they should get... stitches.                                      Professor Keating: I u-understand! I'll tell everyone you've b-been here all week!                  Raul: You're a good man, Mr. Keating. I'm sure Noah's mom will appreciate it.                       Professor Keating: ...G-Give her a k-kiss for me.                                                   Raul: Oh, we will, Mr. Keating... We will...                                                        Orion: (Hmm? What's up with those two? Why is Mr. Keating sweating so much?) Huh? Hey! Alex! Wait!  We have to talk about the project!                                                                  Alex: It's Alexandra.                                                                               Orion: What?                                                                                        Alex: My name. Alexandra.                                                                           Orion: Oh, yeah, of course. Sorry. Um... About the project... We should decide on a day to work on  it.                                                                                                 Alex: Yeah, I guess. This Saturday? Are you free in the afternoon?                                  Orion: Sure, sounds good. I'd say we could do it at my place, but there’s a lot of people there and we’d probably need to work somewhere more quiet...                                                  Alex: We can go to my house. I'm normally by myself on Saturdays.                                   Orion: (Nice...) Sweet! Do you know what we could do the project on? Mr. Keating said we had to     write a paper on something related to the topic of social control. Maybe we could write about the   influence of the media? Or about a cult! Have you heard about the Sons of...                        Alex: We can talk about it on Saturday.                                                             Orion: Oh... yeah, of course. Um... By the way, I'm Orion. I saw you before, at the pool.           Alex: Yes, I know.                                                                                  Orion: Oh... I thought you didn't notice me.                                                        Alex: Anything else?                                                                                Orion: Um...                                                                                        Compliment her tattoos                                                                              Orion: Can I tell you something? I love your tattoos. I noticed them at the pool and...             Alex: Yeah, yeah, ok. I’ve heard it all before. You don’t need to kiss my ass, alright? I don't need any new friends.                                                                                   Orion: Oh... I just...                                                                              Alex: What are you gonna mention next? My hair? Yeah, it's ashen. Swimming? Yep, I'm pretty good at it. Thanks, but no thanks.                                                                          Orion: Um... (Damn, she's a tough one to talk to...)                                                Alex: Are we done?                                                                                  Orion: I... guess so, yeah.                                                                         Compliment her swimming skills                                                                      Orion: Can I tell you something? You're the best swimmer I've ever seen. I saw you at the pool      and...                                                                                              Alex: Yeah, yeah, ok. I’ve heard it all before. You don’t need to kiss my ass, alright? I don't need any new friends.                                                                                   Orion: Oh... I just...                                                                              Alex: What are you gonna mention next? My hair? Yeah, it's ashen. My tattoos? Yep, I have a lot of  them. Thanks, but no thanks.                                                                        Orion: Um... (Damn, she's a tough one to talk to...)                                                Alex: Are we done?                                                                                  Orion: I... guess so, yeah.                                                                         Compliment her hair                                                                                 Orion: Can I tell you something? I love your hair. I noticed how cool it looked when you got out of the pool and–                                                                                       Alex: Yeah, yeah, ok. I’ve heard it all before. You don’t need to kiss my ass, alright? I don't need any new friends.                                                                                   Orion: Oh... I just...                                                                              Alex: What are you gonna mention next? My tattoos? Yeah, I have a lot of them. Swimming? Yep, I'm   pretty good at it. Thanks, but no thanks.                                                           Orion: Um... (Damn, she's a tough one to talk to...)                                                Alex: Are we done?                                                                                  Orion: I... guess so, yeah.                                                                         Compliment her pen                                                                                  Orion: Can I tell you something? You have a nice pen.                                               Alex: Um... Excuse me? My... pen?                                                                   Orion: Yeah, I happened to notice it earlier and it's a good one. Good brand. Made of good quality  materials.                                                                                          Alex: . . . Are you seriously complimenting me on that? My fucking pen?                             Orion: Erm... Yes?                                                                                  Alex: Aren't you gonna mention my hair? My tattoos? That you saw my swimming at the pool?           Orion: Uhh... Should I? I mean, your hair is... pretty hairy...? And yeah, I saw you swimming, but  it wasn’t anything to write home about... To be honest, I could probably swim faster than you if I  trained seriously. And now that you mention it... yeah, looks like it's true, you have some tattoos. Cool, I guess.                                                                                     Alex: . . .                                                                                         Orion: . . .                                                                                        Alex: . . . Maybe you're not just another boring dummy after all. I like your style.                Orion: Oh well... thanks. Was it something I said?                                                  Alex: No, it's what you didn't say. I don't like having my ass kissed, or having everyone tell me   over and over what they think I want to hear. I like your sarcasm... Orion. You said you were       Dalia's friend?                                                                                     Orion: Yeah, we’ve known each other since we were little.                                           Alex: Probably the only two people in this class that are actually worth talking to.                Orion: Thanks, but I don't like having my ass kissed.                                               Alex: *Chuckles* Well... anything else, Orion?                                                      Orion: Hmm... nope, I think that was all.                                                           Alex: Cool. I'll see you tomorrow. Peace.                                                           Orion: Sure. Goodbye, Alex!                                                                         Alex: Alexandra.                                                                                    Orion: Oh... shit, yeah sorry, I forgot. Didn't Dalia call you Alex, though?                        Alex: She can do it. You can't.                                                                     Orion: Gotcha. Goodbye, Alexandra.                                                                  Alex: Bye.                                                                                          Orion: (Hmm... She seems... interesting. Let's see how Saturday's meeting goes.) *Looking at your   phone* Hmm... (Oh shit! I have to go home!! IT’S ETERNUM TIME!) Go, go, go! Annie?                  Annie: Finally! Let's go! We're already late!                                                       Orion: *Laughs* What are you wearing?                                                               Annie: No time for questions! Come on!                                                              Orion: Ok, ok! But seriously, what are you wearing?                                                 Annie: Eternum's official E-Suit, of course! Didn't you see all the stuff that was inside the game’s box??                                                                                              Orion: Ohhh... that makes sense. To be honest... no, I didn't. I only took out the implant to charge it. So... I have to wear that suit too?                                                            Annie: Correct! I mean, technically you only really need the visor and neural implant connected, but without the suit, you might experience some bugs during your gameplay. You don’t want a buggy      playthrough, do you?                                                                                Orion: Hell no! But... does that mean that you're playing right now? Are you inside Eternum?        Annie: Nah, I just wanted to show you how cool the suit looks. And I wanna show you how to log in. I can remove my visor at any time. See?                                                              Orion: Nice!                                                                                        Annie: Alright then, let's not waste any more time! Put on the E-Suit. I won’t look.                Orion: You can look if you want...                                                                  Annie: O-Of course not!                                                                             Orion: *Laughs* Ok, ok...                                                                           Annie: First I'll help you connect your neural implant and visor, and then after you're all set up, I'll go to my room to log in myself. You’re gonna start off by talking to the Eternum Lady. It’s a  required step for all new players. I should be connected by the time you're done, and then all      you’ll have to do is accept the invitation to my server.                                            Orion: Got it. I'm ready.                                                                           Annie: Nice! That suit looks good on you! Now sit down!                                             Orion: And now what?                                                                                Annie: You just have to insert the E-3X implant under your skin and then connect the other end to   the visor.                                                                                          Orion: T-The what?? Under my what?!                                                                 Annie: Don't worry, it’ll sting only a tiny bit! I bet you won't even feel it.                      Orion: Ok, if you sa- FUCK!!                                                                        Annie: Sorry! Did that hurt?!                                                                       Orion: N-No, no, I barely felt it...                                                                Annie: Ok, now put on the visor... This goes there... And then this here... And now...              Orion: Wow!                                                                                         Annie: Is it working?                                                                               Orion: Yeah! I mean, I don't know, all I see is blue.                                               Annie: Then it's working! Awesome! You're officially connected to Eternum! This will only happen on your very first time, don't worry. After that, the loading will be much faster. You should be       getting access any moment now... First, you'll lose the sense of feeling in your legs. After that,  your sense of hearing will seem to fade away. Lastly, your vision will slowly start to blur and then you won’t be able to see this room anymore.                                                        Orion: Hmmm... now that you mention it, it does kind of feel like my legs have fallen asleep or     something... Hmm? Three what? . . . Oh damn, I can't hear you! I can't hear a thing! Two what? Is it something important? Annie?! C-Can we stop for a second? Oh shit, I forgot to go to the bathroom... I hope I don’t lose control of my bowels next... Annie! Why are you making that face? Is something wrong?! What? Oh, fuck! I'm blind! Annie? Where are you? I can't see shit! *Standing up* Annie?!    What's... What's that noise? Waves? What the... T-The ocean? Am I... Am I flying? Holy shit, I'm    flying! But I... I can't feel my body...                                                            E-3X successfully connected.                                                                        Orion: Huh?! Who said that?!

Neural synapse completed. Player number 421,200,234 successfully registered. Welcome to Eternum.    Orion: Arghh... My eyes... Where the hell am I now...                                               Idriel: We are glad to have you, Orion.                                                             Orion: *Turning around* What the... Who are you?                                                    Idriel: My name is Idriel, but most people know me as... "The Eternum Lady". I'm here to welcome you to the game, while your brain finishes adapting to the new environment. You'll notice your sight   and hearing are your body’s only functioning senses right now.                                      Orion: I can't feel anything yet, then? Or smell anything? Or... Hold up a second... Why the hell am I naked?!                                                                                          Idriel: Your outfit wasn't scanned. Only your physical body has been replicated within the game. You will notice how everything has been generated with extreme precision and accuracy, down to the most intimate details.                                                                                  Orion: Um... yeah, I can see that. Looks like everything's in its correct place. So... Are you... an AI?                                                                                                Idriel: That is correct. The Founder created me to assist him with some of the game’s maintenance   tasks. In fact, I'm not even physically here.                                                       Orion: You're not... here?                                                                          Idriel: I am not. I must be in several places at the same time. You’re only viewing a generated     image of me. I oversee all the other NPCs in Eternum. I can shut down servers and add, delete, or   modify variables in real-time. My existence wouldn't be necessary if the Founder himself could be   everywhere at once, but... he's just a man, after all. Hmm... Looks like you have a compatibility of 100%. Astonishing.                                                                                 Orion: Is that good?                                                                                Idriel: It is. I haven't seen that in a very long time...                                           Orion: Well... What now?                                                                            Idriel: Your next step will be to log in to one of the thousands of servers that form the Network of Eternum. Each server has its own pre-defined rules, but they all have something in common... The   Gems of Doom. Ten gems... and the whole world searching for them...                                 Orion: Oh yes, I heard something about that...                                                      Idriel: The person who manages to gather all 10 gems will unlock access to the Temple of Acheron and thus claim the throne of Eternum. The gems are hidden, scattered randomly across all servers. They could be anywhere.                                                                                  Orion: Claiming the throne of Eternum... What will that do?                                         Idriel: The one who ultimately claims the throne of Eternum... will take the place of the Founder.  They will be able to shape the world of Eternum to their will, and become CEO of Ulysses and its    major shareholder within the real world. The most powerful being over two entire worlds.            Orion: Wow... But why would the Founder give that power away?                                       Idriel: Everything will be revealed... to the one who completes his quest. However, you must hurry. 5 gems have already been found. Only 5 remain hidden...                                             Orion: Aw shit, I’m late to the party as usual.                                                     Idriel: Not quite. If you defeat the current holders of the 5 gems, you can claim them as yours.    Orion: And how am I supposed to do that? I'm just a noob here...                                    Idriel: Long ago, I decided to assist players in this grueling mission by creating 3 powerful items: the Weapons of Atlas. If you manage to wield one of them, you'll be able to defeat anything in your path.                                                                                              Orion: Holy shit, I'm gonna need a pen and paper to write down all this stuff. Eternum's lore is way more complicated than I thought... Okay... the Weapons of Atlas. Can you tell me more about them?  Idriel: Hyas. The first weapon. Hyas can cut through anything. Flesh and bones. Ice and rock. Water and fire. Its energy is so powerful that it could melt metal without even making contact.           Orion: Wow... it looks badass. Where is it located now?                                             Idriel: It was wielded by Asmerilth of Mirrah.                                                      Orion: Is that another player?                                                                      Idriel: It was. He died and lost everything, including Hyas. The current owner is... publicly       unknown.                                                                                            Orion: Dammit. That's of little use to me, then.                                                    Idriel: What you do with this information... is up to you. You'd be wise to remember my words.      Orion: Hm, you’re right. I will.                                                                    Idriel: Dione. The second Weapon of Atlas.                                                          Orion: A sniper rifle?!                                                                             Idriel: Its bullets can travel for hundreds of miles... and nothing escapes its path. They say a    bullet from Dione will never miss its target. Its owner is Delilah Warren. She's made it known that any challenger desiring the weapon will have to take it from her cold, dead hands. And finally...   The third Weapon of Atlas—the most powerful of them all. Calypso. Its location is still a mystery,  but there are a few rumors floating around...                                                       Orion: If I don't know where these weapons are... Isn't it a waste of time? Wouldn't it be better   just to go straight for the Gems?                                                                   Idriel: Obtain one of the gems, and it might be the only one you ever find. Obtain one of the       Weapons of Atlas, however, and you’ll be equipped to find whatever you desire.                      Orion: Hmm... And this... Calypso... What is it? A sword? A gun?                                    Idriel: No person thus far has been able to find it. So the truth is, no one really knows what it   is. It could be another sword, rifle, or perhaps a different sort of weapon. Some people even say   the Weapons of Atlas can take different forms depending on who finds them...                        Orion: But you have to know! You created them, didn't you?                                          Idriel: I cannot tell you anything more than what has already been said.                            Orion: Of course...                                                                                 Idriel: It seems you are about ready to begin your journey, Orion. Before we part ways, is there    anything else you would like to know?                                                               What happens to my real-life body while I'm here?                                                   Idriel: You don't move. For a fully immersive experience, all of your motor functions are channeled directly to your virtual avatar. No matter what you do in Eternum, your real body will remain still. However, your autonomic nervous system remains fully operational, so bodily functions such as blood flow, digestion, and respiratory activity are still active. You could just think of this all as... a very vivid dream.                                                                                 Can I die in Eternum? Can I feel pain?                                                              Idriel: Yes, you can feel pain. Our goal was to create a world where anything is possible. You must be responsible for your own actions—the same as you would be in the other world.                    Orion: "More real than real life".                                                                  Idriel: Exactly. Therefore, if your wounds are too severe, your in-game character could die. If your character dies, you'll lose all your levels and whatever is in your inventory: weapons, armor,     supplies, and even rare items—like Gems of Doom. Nothing is protected. When that happens, you'll be disconnected from the game and you cannot play again until after a 24-hour waiting period. Once that has passed, you'll have to start from scratch.                                                     Orion: Like a perma-death mode.                                                                     Idriel: You could say that.                                                                         How can I join a server? How can I leave it?                                                        Idriel: Very few servers are public. If you want to join a new one, you’ll need to get your hands on either an invitation from another player who's already there, or a ticket that grants you access.  To leave a server, you must use one of these portals. A portal will let you travel to another server or disconnect from the game. If you happen to log off without using a portal, you'll lose all your inventory. The game treats such sudden disconnects as if you had died. So before entering a         dungeon... make sure you have enough time.                                                          Are there any general rules in Eternum?                                                             Idriel: As I said before, each server has its own rules. Some are more lenient than others, but you should always respect the basic, ethical rules. You aren't allowed to inflict pain just for the sake of it, or use the network to traffic illegal content.                                              Orion: And... what if people do it anyway?                                                          Idriel: This is a Praetorian. Eternum's official law enforcement authority. You can find them on all servers. If they discover you are participating in illegal activities, you will be excommunicated. That means you won't be able to access the game ever again, and depending on your actions, you'll   also be reported to real-world authorities.                                                         Orion: Damn, I hope I'm never in that position.                                                     Can you uhh...                                                                                      Orion: Have... Um...                                                                                Idriel: Yes, you can have sex in Eternum.                                                           Orion: W-Wha... How did you...                                                                      Idriel: According to our most recent survey, 67% of the male players who logged in last year        reported sexual activities as their primary reason for playing.                                     Orion: Oh my...                                                                                     Idriel: Eternum replicates real-life experiences to the fullest extent. That, of course, includes   one of the most popular real-life experiences: sexual intercourse. However, NPCs are not designed to participate in such activities, so if you are looking to get laid, you'll have to woo another      player, or... hire the services of a professional instead.                                          Orion: So... if I’m not having any luck with ladies in the real world... then I probably won't have any here either?                                                                                    Idriel: Not necessarily. Eternum is a completely new world. Yes, you may have the same body, but... this is your chance to start fresh. A blank canvas...                                               Orion: I see...                                                                                     That was all, I'm ready.                                                                            Idriel: Good. Thank you for buying the game, Orion. We hope you enjoy the many adventures that await you. You'll now be teleported to the server where you were invited. Ahh... Ion! Quite a rough place for new players. I hope the girl who invited you there knows how to defend herself.                Orion: *Chuckles* Maybe not in the real world, but here? I'm sure she does.                         Idriel: Goodbye, Orion. This time... it will be the right one.                                      Orion: Hmm? What do you mean by that? Aaaargh... My ears... Where the hell am I now? W-Water? (Fuck, I feel like shit... I can't even...) *Gagging* (I'm dizzy...) *Getting up from the floor* Ughhh... (Dammit, Annie didn't tell me about any of this... Is this what Eternum is? A seasickness simulator? I think I've played enough for today. How the hell do I disconnect?) Hmm... (I will...) What...    (What the... What is this place? T-The... The ground's cold... My hand is wet... My clothes are...  soaked.) *Tasting it* (This water tastes like... metal... I... I can feel the wind against my face. Against my hand... My eyes are getting used to the low light... Hmm... sounds like noise... echoing in the distance... H-How is this possible? This feels...)                                           Annie: More real than real life, isn't it?                                                          Orion: W-What? A-Annie? What the hell... Is that you?!                                              Annie: *Laughs* As far as I can tell, yes, it is. Are you feeling dizzy?                            Orion: Y-Yeah, a bit... My head is spinning right now.                                              Annie: It's normal! It happens to everyone during their first time. You should have seen me on my   first day here. *Laughs* I even threw up a couple of times! But it's a small price to pay for being part of the greatest technological achievement of human history!                                    Orion: Yeah, actually, I'm feeling better already.                                                  Annie: That's great! It means that you're very compatible with the system! Can you stand up?        Orion: Yes, I think so.                                                                             Annie: Alright then! I'm really happy that I get to be the first one who introduces you to our      world, Orion! Welcome to the greatest experience you'll ever have. Welcome... ...to Eternum.        Orion: This is... incredible...                                                                     Annie: I've been telling you for years how amazing this place is!                                   Orion: Yeah, I know, but... Damn, I wasn't expecting it to feel so... real. How come there aren’t   any Eternum gameplay videos online? Like somebody streaming their playthroughs?                     Annie: All your senses are being generated by your brain, thanks to the neural implant. That        includes your vision. That's why everything looks so real. Because in a certain sense... it is.     There are no videos because there's no screen to be recorded. Here, your eyes are just doing what   they’re meant to do... "see the world around them", which just happens to be virtual. *Giggles* I'm sorry, I'm not explaining it too well. I guess only the Founder knows how it all technically works! Orion: Damn, that's amazing... By the way, your outfit looks awesome! And your hair! It’s so long on here!                                                                                              Annie: Yeah! You can't change much about your body’s appearance, but you can still change your      clothes, hairstyle, accessories, and all that stuff. At least in this server. Each server has its   own rules, and some of them force you to wear a certain outfit. Do you like it?                     Orion: It looks awesome! And what are those swords? Are they just floating around you?              Annie: Hell yeah! They were part of an event that took place a couple of months ago. There were only 10 sets given out in all of Eternum, so these are actually pretty rare!                            Orion: That's so cool!                                                                              Annie: Well, let's go to the market. I have a surprise for you.                                     Orion: Oh! Is it a cool outfit too? I look like a peasant standing next to you.                     Annie: *Laughs* That's the basic outfit of Ion. I'd give you a nicer one, but you'd only be able to wear it on this server. I have something much better, just trust me! Let's not waste any more time. Are you ready?                                                                                      Orion: Ready!                                                                                       Annie: Behind that door is the entrance to the market. This is just the lobby. You can't harm anyone or be harmed here—it’s a safe zone. But remember, once we're outside of this lobby, you're on your own.                                                                                                Orion: Got it. Man, who created this place? It's incredible.                                        Annie: There are some environment-creation tools available, but the learning curve is pretty steep. You need extensive knowledge in computer engineering, software design, and even physics to make it  all function properly. And you need a lot of money too. A normal guy with a “potato laptop” would   never be able to create such a server.                                                              Orion: I guess that makes sense. And would you say the market we're going to is dangerous?          Annie: Well... kinda. I’ll put it this way... just make sure you watch your step. If you trip and   fall, it'll hurt you. If you get robbed, you'll of course lose your items. If you die... You'll lose all of your belongings and even your level. It’s pretty harsh.                                     Orion: Are all Eternum servers like this?                                                           Annie: Lobbies are usually always safe zones, and some servers might have other special conditions, but... yeah, they all pretty much function in the same way.                                         Orion: Have you ever died before?                                                                   Annie: I wouldn't be level 33 if I had. It takes a long time to rebuild an account.                 Orion: Impressive. I guess you must be pretty tough with those swords of yours! I might not have any swords, but my avatar actually came equipped with guns already...                                  Annie: Riiiight. Actually, these aren’t your typical swords. They are only catalysts for my main    weapon... Magic!                                                                                    Orion: Wow...                                                                                       Annie: Magic is forbidden in some servers, but I never visit those anyways. You can specialize in   whatever combat style you prefer.                                                                   Megan: Annie!                                                                                       Annie: Huh? Hey there!                                                                              Chloe: What do we have here, babe? Fresh meat? Did you bring a newbie to Ion?                       Megan: *Laughs* You're so evil! He's gonna get himself killed.                                      Annie: No, he's not! He's Orion! He's tough!                                                        Megan: Ohhh... Orion?                                                                               Chloe: So this is the Orion you're always talking about?                                            Annie: W-What? *Nervous laughter* Ah... y-yeah!                                                     Chloe: I like him. I can see why you-                                                               Annie: No time to talk! We need to get going! Sorry girls, I'll see you another day.                Chloe: *Laughs*                                                                                     Megan: Sure, Annie. Remember to call us if you ever need help. We still owe you one.                Annie: Will do! Take care!                                                                          Orion: Looks like you’ve made a name for yourself here.                                             Annie: Yeah, I come here almost every day. And I've made it through a lot of challenges.            Orion: *Laughs* Really? That doesn’t sound like the Annie I know!                                   Annie: That's the thing, Orion! You can be anything you want here! And now... I know what we’re     about to do will look scary at first, but just trust me okay?                                       Orion: What do you mean? I'm not scared, I'm actually starting to get pretty comfortable in this    world.                                                                                              Annie: That's what I wanted to hear! Now just ignore your fears and follow me! Take the leap of     faith!                                                                                              Orion: W... WHAT?! ANNIE?! Holy shit, she jumped! Annie?! I’m supposed to follow her?! Holy fuck,   it's a long way down... I can't even see the ground from here. I’m in the wrong server! I should be jumping into pools or into a bed with hot women! What if I jump and the game gets buggy and I turn  into a splattered mess at the bottom! . . .                                                         Jump                                                                                                Orion: (Alright, that’s enough Orion, you're not a coward. Not on here. You are whatever you choose to be. I'm going to do it. Yes, I’m not afraid. Everything is going to be alright. Jump on the count of three, yeah. I'll get a running start first, and then I'll jump. Don't overthink it, Orion, just commit.) 1... 2... 3!                                                                              Don't jump                                                                                          Orion: (Oh shit, I can't do this. My legs are shaking... I'll just go back to the lobby and wait for Annie there. But then what will she think when she notices I’m not down there with her...)         Chloe: Come on, Orion, don't be such a pussy!                                                       Orion: W-WHAT?!                                                                                     Chloe: Annie told us you were cool! Prove it!                                                       Orion: FUCKING BITCH!!! Oh shit. OH SHIT! SHIT, SHIT, SHIT!!! OOOOHHH SHIIIIIITT!!! Oh, damn... What a fall... Annie? Am I dead? Is this the afterlife?                                                 Annie: *Laughs* Of course not! I bet it didn't even hurt a bit!                                     Orion: Now that you mention it... Yeah, you're right. It didn't hurt at all. My legs feel just fine! Would’ve thought for sure I’d turn into Lieutenant Dan...                                          Annie: Falling from the nexus can't harm you. It's designed that way. With a bit of practice, you'll learn to land on your feet. You’ll be able to pull off some stylish landings in no time!           Orion: I hope so... Guess I did a good job of embarrassing myself up there... Nobody saw that,      right?                                                                                              Annie: Just a few dozen people.                                                                     Orion: Oh, fuck...                                                                                  Annie: *Laughs* No worries, we've all been newbies before. Come on now, get up! We’ve got so many   things to do, places to see... time really flies here! To the market!                               Orion: *Getting up from the floor* Oh my fucking god...                                             Annie: Welcome to Ion! If you can't find a weapon or armor piece here, then you won’t find it       anywhere! It’s got everything!                                                                      Orion: Wow...                                                                                       Annie: To the west is Apollo Square, to the north—Union Station, while further to the east is the   Black Market. First, we’ll head over to 7th street. There’s a woman there who owes me a favor. We'll go see her together. Follow me!                                                                    Orion: Thank god I have you, Annie... I’d probably be lost in a ditch somewhere without you!        Annie: *Giggles* My pleasure!                                                                       Orion: Huh? What's that sound?                                                                      Annie: Oh my god! A public announcement! It's been a while since the last broadcast...              Orion: A public announcement?                                                                       ???: Good evening, citizens of Eternum!                                                             Orion: Huh?                                                                                         ???: I hope you're having a lovely session today.                                                   Orion: Sure, thanks man.                                                                            ???: Today, we’ve set a new record for the number of simultaneous players on Eternum: over 51       million people are currently online!                                                                Orion: Um... Okay? *Whispering* Annie, do you know this guy?                                        Annie: Know him? Everyone knows him. He’s the man who made all of this possible. The brain that     envisioned this brand new world. The god of this realm. He is... The Founder.                       Orion: The Founder? Oh shit, this is the CEO of Ulysses?! And he's speaking to us?!                 Annie: Of course not! He doesn’t have time to talk to peasants like us! This is just a              system-generated image. A "hologram", if you prefer. His image and speech are being projected in    front of all players right now. Take a look around!                                                 Orion: Oh damn, it's true, there are a lot of copies of him.                                        Annie: Millions of them.                                                                            Orion: Can I speak to him? Like I did with Idriel?                                                  Annie: Nah, Idriel is an AI, but The Founder is human. He can only be in one place at a time, so you can't interact with him. He uses this system to communicate important information with the         players.                                                                                            Orion: I guess that makes sense.                                                                    The Founder: But let's cut to the chase! Another Gem of Doom has been found!                        Annie: Oh my god! Another one?! Amazing!                                                            Orion: Do you have any?                                                                             Annie: *Laughs* I wish. There are only 10 of them in the entire world. You need strength,           intelligence, talent... and really, a lot of pure luck just to find one.                            Orion: Hey, you already have plenty of the first three.                                             Annie: *Giggles* Thanks, but believe me, it's impossible.                                           The Founder: The sixth Gem was found on the server of Styx! But, as always, whoever discovered it   will remain anonymous.                                                                              Orion: Hmm... Why would the Founder want to give up all his money and power to whoever finds all the Gems? I don’t get it...                                                                            Annie: Because he never wanted riches or fame to begin with, merely to share his dreams and creation with us. And now he just wants to find a worthy successor.                                         Orion: If you say so...                                                                             The Founder: Remember. The person who manages to gather all 10 Gems will gain access to the Temple  of Acheron and thus claim the throne of Eternum... ...To become the most powerful person on Earth.  And that is all I needed to say. Keep fighting, citizens of Eternum. 4 Gems are yet to be found.    Success awaits you.                                                                                 Orion: Hmm? W-What the fuck, is he looking at me?                                                   Annie: *Laughs* Of course not! He’s probably just looking off to the side, at wherever he’s         physically located.                                                                                 Orion: Well, it looks like he's staring directly into my eyes. It's kinda creepy. Weird... Is there any more information about this... Founder?                                                         Annie: Not really. The internet is full of old wives’ tales and conspiracies about who he is, but no one really knows for certain. In my opinion, he's just a man with a prodigious mind who likes to   keep his personal life private.                                                                     Orion: Hmm... Maybe you're right.                                                                   Annie: Anyway, we're wasting precious time! Let's go to the market. Are you ready?                  Orion: Ready!                                                                                       Annie: Follow me!                                                                                   Kitty: Hello... Orion.                                                                              Orion: Hi! Wow, your costume looks awesome!                                                         Kitty: Thank you. I crafted it myself. Annie told me you wanted to purchase the Sword of Drax.      Normally an item like this would have a high asking price, but since I owe Annie a favor... Consider yourself lucky.                                                                                    Orion: I get that a lot.                                                                            Annie: Alright! This was my surprise!                                                               Orion: Thanks, Annie!                                                                               Annie: Also, take these 1500 eternals. It's the game's currency.                                    Orion: Really? Awesome!                                                                             Kitty: That's a pretty generous gift, Orion. An eternal is worth a dollar in the real world.        Orion: What?! You just gave me $1500?! I can't accept it.                                           Annie: Well you don’t have a choice! This is my gift to you!                                        Orion: But it's too much money! Where did you get it?                                               Annie: I don't know... working, exploring, fighting. Some people literally earn their real-life     wages in Eternum. Store owners, cleaners, blacksmiths, tailors... They exchange their eternals for  dollars at the end of the month, and they end up earning twice as much as they would at a normal    job. I don't have any need for this money in the real world, so I’m gifting it to you. And you're   gonna take it. End of discussion.                                                                   Orion: But... *Sighs* Ok, ok, but I'll pay you back when I eventually earn my own money!            Annie: Sure, if that makes you feel better, go ahead. You can go to that shop over there, with that scavenger. You can buy anything you want. It's your money now! But spend it wisely! I’m gonna stay  back. I need to discuss a couple of things with Kitty. Go ahead, I'll be right there.               Orion: Alright. Thank you Annie! (Damn, that sure was a generous gift. I really have to pay         everything back to Annie one day. Ok, let's see what they sell here.) Hello? Are you open?          Chop-Chop: Huh? OOOOOOHHH! KHACH XIAN TOA LIKO CO!                                                  Orion: What?                                                                                        Chop-Chop: WELL HELLO, FRIEND!                                                                      Orion: HELLO! WHY ARE WE SCREAMING?!                                                                Chop-Chop: Welcome to Chop-Chop's! Best shop in all of Ion! No, no, IN ALL OF ETERNUM!              Orion: Um... What do you sell here?                                                                 Chop-Chop: What DON'T I sell! Me have everything! Only best materials! Best products!               Orion: Ok... Show me your best items, then.                                                         Chop-Chop: Money... money... How much money you have??                                              Orion: Um... (I don't want this guy to scam me, I better be careful...) 300 eternals.               Chop-Chop: Good! Good money! Top 4 items! I show, I show!! You choose!                              Orion: Alright, sounds good.                                                                        Chop-Chop: First: Shovel of Destiny! Wielded by King Frey the Great!                                Orion: (That looks like a rusty shovel I’d find in the trash...) What's it for?                     Chop-Chop: To shovel!                                                                               Orion: To shovel?                                                                                   Chop-Chop: SHOVEL!!                                                                                 Orion: Um... Ok... I'll... I'll think about it. Anything else?                                      Chop-Chop: Of course! Many many more goods! I show! Pistol of Destiny!                              Orion: Another piece of junk?                                                                       Chop-Chop: No, no, you simple-minded boob! Look like old pistol, but really a powerful laser gun!!  Orion: Oh, really?                                                                                  Chop-Chop: Yes! Shots can melt metal!! Absolutely lethal! Pew pew, OWWW!! Stand aside! I show you!  You see pipes?                                                                                      Orion: Yeah.                                                                                        Chop-Chop: Well, see them no longer! I disintegrate with Pistol of Destiny! Be careful, shock wave  could throw you all the way across the street! Pew pew, WEEEEE!! WATCH OUT!! Oh shit.               Orion: Did... D-Did you just kill that guy?                                                         Chop-Chop: Well, maybe no melt metal, but you saw... it works!! Absolutely lethal! Pew pew,         OSHIEEEET!!!!                                                                                       Orion: D-Did you...                                                                                 Chop-Chop: Third item of collection: Glasses of Destiny!                                            Orion: I'm starting to see a pattern here...                                                        Chop-Chop: Give you X-Ray vision!! Can get a looksie at what under armor of other players!          Orion: (Ohh... interesting...)                                                                      Chop-Chop: Can look for enemy's weaknesses! If he hiding wound, attack him there. Pew pew, ZING!! If he have small pee-pee, you make fun of him and his poor weenie genetics. He get mad, he drop guard, you attack!! Pew pew, KABLAM!!                                                                     Orion: Ok, let me try that.                                                                         Chop-Chop: Okey dokey!                                                                              Orion: Hmm... Everything looks the same to me.                                                      Chop-Chop: No! You dumb-dumb! Press button on right side, dipshit!                                  Orion: The right button? Oh! It worked! But only your cap disappeared.                              Chop-Chop: Keep pressing!                                                                           Orion: *Laughs* It works! This is awesome! ...though I do prefer you with clothes on.               Chop-Chop: I tell you no lies! Only truth! Only top-quality in my shop!                             Annie: Hey! Did you find anything cool?                                                             Orion: Annie! Yeah, Chop-Chop has some cool gadgets.                                                Annie: *Laughs* What are you wearing?                                                               Orion: Ohh... Um... Nothing, these are just some glasses to help my aim.                            Annie: They are striking!                                                                           Orion: That's my style!                                                                             Annie: *Laughs* Anyway, I'm going with Kitty to grab the sword. She's got it stored in a garage     nearby. I'll be right back.                                                                         Orion: Sure, no problem.                                                                            Activate the glasses                                                                                Orion: (I wonder if...)                                                                             Don't activate the glasses                                                                          Orion: (That's a bad idea...)                                                                       Annie: It shouldn't take more than 15 minutes.                                                      Orion: Mm-hm.                                                                                       Annie: She could go alone, but... Don't get me wrong, I trust her, but... You can never be too      cautious in Eternum.                                                                                Orion: Yeah, I can imagine.                                                                         Annie: So I think it'd be better if I go with her. *Laughs* Don't get lost or get yourself into much trouble, alright?                                                                                  Orion: *Laughs* I'll try.                                                                           Annie: If you avoid the alleyways, you shouldn't have any problems. Wait for me in the corner, over by the garbage can.                                                                                 Orion: Sure, I'll be there.                                                                         Annie: Cool. See you in a minute!                                                                   Orion: Bye! (Oh my...)                                                                              Annie: It shouldn't take more than 15 minutes.                                                      Orion: Mm-hm...                                                                                     Annie: She could go alone, but... Don't get me wrong, I trust her, but... You can never be too      cautious in Eternum.                                                                                Orion: Yeah, I can imagine...                                                                       Annie: So I think it'd be better if I go with her. *Laughs* Don't get lost or get yourself into much trouble, alright?                                                                                  Orion: (OH. MY. FUCKING. GOD.)                                                                      Annie: If you avoid the alleyways, you shouldn't have any problems.                                 Orion: (Jeez, I've always tried to not think of Annie in "that" way because I don't want to ruin our friendship, but now... Wow... She's got curves in all the right places... Holy shit... Those       hips... And how the hell did she get those abs? I've never seen her doing any kind of exercise...   Maybe she started working out in secret?)                                                           Annie: Wait for me in the corner, over by the garbage can.                                          Orion: (Damn... I guess she’s not the skinny kid she used to be...)                                 Annie: Ok?                                                                                          Orion: W-What?                                                                                      Annie: Earth to Orion, hello! Are you alright?                                                      Orion: Y-Yeah, s-sorry. I was distracted. Um... T-The garbage can, sure. Erm... I'll be there.      Annie: Cool. See you in a little while!                                                             Orion: B-Bye! (Jesus...) Ok, man... This one is... an interesting tool, for sure.                   Chop-Chop: Told ya! I tell you no lies! Only truth! And this my last item!                          Orion: What is it? I think it’ll be pretty hard to beat the glasses, to be honest.                  Chop-Chop: Pendant of Destiny! Legend say it bring luck to woman who wear it... forever!!           Orion: That sounds like a fairy tale.                                                               Chop-Chop: Whether you believe or not... is your choice. You can choose to be dumb shitbag! But     remember, Chop-Chop only sell top-quality products! This is best one yet...                         Orion: Hmmm...                                                                                      Buy the shovel                                                                                      Orion: Um... I'll take the shovel.                                                                  Chop-Chop: Excellent, excellent! Great choice!                                                      Orion: (I hope that shovel will be of some use in the future...)                                    Buy the pistol                                                                                      Orion: Um... I'll take the pistol.                                                                  Chop-Chop: Excellent, excellent! Great choice!                                                      Orion: (I hope that pistol will be of some use in the future...)                                    Buy the glasses                                                                                     Orion: I'll take the uhh... glasses... strictly for combat purposes...                              Chop-Chop: Excellent, excellent! Great choice!                                                      Orion: (I'm sure these glasses will be of some use...)                                              Buy the pendant                                                                                     Orion: Um... I'll take the pendant.                                                                 Chop-Chop: Excellent, excellent! Great choice!                                                      Orion: (I'm sure Annie will like this... I hope it really does bring her good luck.) Well, I gotta  go! Thank you!                                                                                      Chop-Chop: THANK YOU, FRIEND! COME BACK TO CHOP-CHOP'S ANOTHER DAY! I MISS YOU ALREADY! TOP QUALITY PRODUCT! No refund or exchanges. BYE BYE FOR NOW!!                                                  Orion: Well, I'll wait for Annie here. (Although... She said she'd be back in 15 minutes. I still   have some time left. Maybe I could go explore a bit...)                                             Go explore                                                                                          Orion: (Hmmm... What would happen if I just take a quick look around the corner?)                   Wait for Annie                                                                                      Orion: (Hmmm... I should probably stay around here. I don't wanna get attacked or anything...)      *Yawns* (Damn, she's taking long enough... Holy shit, man... this place is amazing... It feels like I’m living inside Blade Runner.) *Reading the sign* (Human taxidermist. Oh damn, I hope that's just the name of a bar. I’m not trying to find out for myself though, that's for sure... Hot damn! I     gotta admit that I love Ion's sense of fashion...) *Reading the sign* (Aphrodite's.) Hmm... (I      wonder what this is. Maybe an upscale restaurant or something? The door looks so fancy.) *Reading   the sign* (The best experience in Eternum. Oh what the hell, let's take a look inside. It can't be  any worse than a “human taxidermist”. Huh? Wow, this place looks so different on the inside. It's   quite the contrast compared to the neon, cyberpunk style on the streets. I wonder what they're      selling here.) Um... Hello? Is anybody there? (Hmm... Must be some kind of exclusive club for rich  people. I should probably leave, I'm starting to feel a little out of place.)                       Madam Ambrose: Welcome to Aphrodite’s.                                                              Orion: *Turning around* Oh... Hi!                                                                   Madam Ambrose: How may I assist you, sir?                                                           Orion: Um... I'm sorry, is this a... hotel? My name's Orion, by the way.                            Madam Ambrose: Welcome, Orion. Is this your first visit to Aphrodite's?                             Orion: Well yes, but it's also my first time in Eternum too!                                        Madam Ambrose: I assumed as much seeing you're wearing Ion's initiation outfit. You couldn't have   come to a better place. Men from around the world come here for... invigoration.                    Orion: Invigoration? Is this...                                                                     Madam Ambrose: Yes. Aphrodite's is a Gentlemen's Club. We’ve been fulfilling fantasies since 1912.  Clubs in London, Paris, Barcelona, Venice, and for almost two years now... Eternum.                 Orion: (Wow, I had heard there was a thriving sex industry inside Eternum, but I wasn't expecting to find it so soon.) So... I can... I mean, could I...                                                Madam Ambrose: I must warn you that we operate differently from the other clubs on the server. The  girl must desire to spend time with you. It's her decision. Displaying inappropriate behavior or    hurting your escort in any way, unless both parties have consented prior, will result in immediate  removal from the premises... ...and the filing of a report with the Praetorians.                    Orion: I understand.                                                                                Madam Ambrose: Oh, and of course, this is an exclusive club that is priced accordingly. Spending    time with the girls will cost between 600 and 1200 eternals.                                        Orion: 1200 eternals? For one night?                                                                Madam Ambrose: For an hour.                                                                         Orion: (Holy shit! $1200 for an hour?! That's all that’s leftover from what Annie gave me. This     place sure is expensive...) Well, I appreciate all of this information, but I think I'll have to    come back another day. I'm going to be hanging around the server much more so you'll probably see me again! It was a pleasure talking to you, thank you.                                                Madam Ambrose: Actually... I might have the perfect girl for you. Would you like to come down and   meet her?                                                                                           Orion: What? Do you mean... right now?                                                              Madam Ambrose: Yes. Don't worry about any commitments at this moment, I just want to introduce you  to her.                                                                                             Orion: Um... Ok, well, I guess I have a couple of minutes.                                          Madam Ambrose: Excellent. Please, follow me. Eva, can you come to the main hall, please? Thank you, darling. This way, sir.                                                                             Orion: Of course. You seem to be pretty welcoming with me. Do you always treat every customer this  way? Not that I don’t appreciate it—I really do—but what if I didn’t have any money?                Madam Ambrose: All clientele are scanned automatically with our security sensors when they enter the building. If you had been carrying any weapons, I'd have asked you to leave them at reception. But I know you're not carrying any.                                                                     Orion: Actually, I have a pistol...                                                                 Madam Ambrose: I know... it's a laser gun, vintage model 300B, and practically an antique. Our scans determined it to be non-operational. You might as well throw it away as they can't be repaired. I  think you’d be better off bringing a squirt gun to a fight instead of that paperweight.             Orion: (Goddamn you, Chop-Chop... “only top-quality”, my ass! Good thing I didn't buy Chop-Chop's   pistol.)                                                                                            Madam Ambrose: And yes, I also know you are in possession of 1200 eternals.                         Orion: Damn, that's a thorough scan.                                                                Madam Ambrose: Better safe than sorry.                                                              Orion: I guess that's true. So this... Eva...                                                       Madam Ambrose: Eva's our newest girl. I tried to show her to 2 potential customers, but she declined them both. One of them even offered to pay 25,000 eternals.                                        Orion: Wow, for just an hour? Really?                                                               Madam Ambrose: Our reputation precedes us. Ah, looks like she's already here. I think you might just be her type, Orion.                                                                                Orion: Well, I can't afford to spend all of my eternals now… I need the money. But I guess it       wouldn’t hurt to meet her. Maybe I’ll come back to spend time with her another day.                 Madam Ambrose: Of course.                                                                           Eva: Good evening, Miss Ambrose.                                                                    Madam Ambrose: Good evening, Eva. This is Orion.                                                    Eva: Hello, Orion.                                                                                  Orion: H-Hello, Eva. Wow, you’re... beautiful. More exotic than I thought. Your hair is really      amazing!                                                                                            Eva: Well aren’t you quite the charmer. Are you trying to make me blush? It might be working...     Orion: I love your dress too, its lights are mesmerizing.                                           Eva: Thank you. I like your style as well.                                                          Orion: *Laughs* Really? I'm only wearing the starter outfit. I look like a peasant, fresh off of    tutorial island.                                                                                    Eva: Exactly. You don't look like those arrogant, sleazy men that usually frequent this place...    dripping sweat, whisky on their breath, and clothes ripe with the foul scent of cigarettes... They  barge in and think they own the place, entitled to anything they throw their filthy money at... That is, until they come to Aphrodite’s. Isn't that right, Miss Ambrose?                                Madam Ambrose: Absolutely. I knew you'd like him.                                                   Eva: I do find Mr. Orion very intriguing... and I’d love to learn more about him...                 Madam Ambrose: Maybe you can go to one of the private booths to become more acquainted with each    other.                                                                                              Eva: I think I would like that a lot...                                                             Madam Ambrose: Only if Orion wants to, of course.                                                   Orion: Yeah, that does sound pretty nice right now... But as much as I would love that, I’m afraid  1200 eternals for a little chat sounds a little too rich for my blood right now.                    Eva: You'd be surprised to know how much money some men spend just to have somebody to talk to. Most of them just come here to be listened to, disconnect from their routine, or confess their most     intimate secrets. In Eternum, they’re able to have another identity. They have a place to truly let go without any shame or regret. There are no eyes watching, no cameras recording, and no judgments  given. They feel... safe. If you gain our trust and allow us to take full care of you, we can help  you relieve your burdens... your stress... your tension. I only wish to take advantage of the five  senses to bring you what you desire... what you crave. You’ll be able to hear the soothing sounds,  smell the arousing scents, taste the forbidden fruit, see the exposed beauty, and feel the warm     embrace...                                                                                          Orion: (Oh God, she's making me horny...)                                                           Madam Ambrose: Alright Orion, what are you gonna do?                                                Orion: Um...                                                                                        Go with Eva                                                                                         Orion: Well... You only live once. I’d love to get to know you more, Eva.                           Eva: Ah, I was hoping you would say that... Come with me. Let’s go somewhere a little more          private...                                                                                          Orion: Alright...                                                                                   Leave                                                                                               Orion: I'd like to, really, but I’m afraid I can’t spend that much money. Also, someone is waiting  for me outside so I should probably get going.                                                      Eva: Ah... That's too bad. I was looking forward to it... I hope we will meet again soon, then.     Orion: I hope so too. Goodbye, Eva.                                                                 Eva: Until next time... Orion.                                                                      Orion: (Damn, that place sure was interesting. I really need to come back someday...)               Eva: We won’t be disturbed in here... let's go inside.                                              Orion: Sure... It smells good in here. And it looks so clean.                                       Eva: The cleaning ladies do a really nice job of keeping this place tidy.                           Orion: Cleaning ladies? Isn't there a button to clean it? To reset the room or something?           Eva: *Laughs* A button? So it really is your first time in Eternum. Unfortunately, things aren’t    quite that simple. If you get injured, your wounds won't heal until they’re treated or you decide to leave the server. If you want a new dress, you have to buy one. If you're dirty... or bloody...    you’ll have to take a shower. Yes, Eternum is definitely "magical" in most aspects, but there isn’t any spell to clean our floors. Otherwise my room would be immaculate!                               Orion: This place is amazing... I still can't believe that someone was able to create this world.   Eva: You haven't seen anything yet, Orion... there’s so many things that make this place            incomparable to the real world. If I could stay here forever, I'd do it.                            Orion: So... you're real, right?                                                                    Eva: Real?                                                                                          Orion: Well, I mean... When I logged in, I spoke with a nice woman who explained how this world     works.                                                                                              Eva: Ah, Idriel. The Eternum Lady.                                                                  Orion: That one. She seemed so real to me. She answered all of my questions and behaved just like a normal person I’d meet in the real world, but... she wasn't. She was an AI. I hear other servers    have even more NPCs that behave as human-like as her, so...                                         Eva: If something or someone is indistinguishable from their real-world counterparts, it blurs the  definition of what truly is “real”. So... would it really make much of a difference if I was “real” or not?                                                                                             Orion: Well... yes. I mean... I think it's important to learn how to differentiate between what’s of the game and what’s from real life.                                                                Eva: How do you define reality, Orion?                                                              Orion: Reality? Well umm... I don't know, it’s all the things that truly exist on their own, without any dependencies. Everything that is really happening.                                             Eva: So our conversation right now, since it’s dependent on the game, does that mean it’s not       actually happening? Your nose smelling my perfume... your eyes seeing me stand before you... your   ears hearing the words I speak... Do all these things not culminate into a real, full-body          experience? If you're unable to know whether the person you're speaking with is a human or an AI,   does it really matter?                                                                              Orion: Um... I guess not, but...                                                                    Eva: If I touch your face, you'll feel my hand. If someone were to hurt you, you’d feel every ounce of pain. If you gave in to another’s seduction, you’d experience all the sensations of pleasure...  The only thing that sets this world apart from the other, is being able to log off. To me, this     place is my real world. The other one is just a gap to which I am forced to return every day.       Orion: I... I don't know. This is awesome, sure, but I don't know if I can see it that way.         Eva: You'll get there... You just need more time. Eternum is like a drug, Orion. Let it overtake    you. Allow yourself to live fully within its world. But... anyway, going back to your question... if you were asking whether there's a girl named Eva in the outside world, lying on her bed, connected to a neural implant... Yes, there is. So I guess that makes me... "real". Does that change your     perspective on our interactions?                                                                    Orion: Well, after everything you said... not really.                                               Eva: Oh... I'm sorry Orion, it wasn't my intention to bring you down... merely to help broaden your perspective so you can truly enjoy all this world has to offer. How about I give you a little       massage to help ease your mind and lift your spirits?                                               Orion: D-Don't worry, you didn't bring me down. Although... the massage idea sounds great.          Eva: I like you, Orion. You have a very inquisitive mind and you aren’t afraid to ask questions. I  like you a lot. You know, I think you’re deserving of my most special massage... I'll convince you  that this world can be real for you, too. How does that sound?                                      Orion: Mm, good... you’ve got me curious.                                                           Eva: Have you ever done anything like this before?                                                  Orion: N-Not really. And... I like you too, Eva. I appreciate that my conversation doesn’t fall on  deaf ears. But I’ll be honest.. I'm kinda nervous.                                                  Eva: There’s no need for that feeling here, baby. Let me help you relax and ease your mind... But   first... Do you mind if I get a little more... comfortable? The neon lights on this dress make me a little too warm...                                                                                  Orion: Of course, go ahead...                                                                       Eva: Thank you... *Snaps fingers*                                                                   Orion: (Oh my god, she's driving me insane. I'm so fucking hard...)                                 Eva: *Snaps fingers*                                                                                Orion: (Oh Jesus...)                                                                                Eva: I might not know any spells for cleaning, but at least I know this bit of magic... Much better now... Don't you think, Orion?                                                                      Orion: Y-Yeah... whatever makes you more... c-comfortable...                                        Eva: Miss Ambrose requires us to wear that dress. It’s really lovely and I like it a lot, but it    does make us girls sweat after awhile...                                                            Orion: Yeah, I guess it can be a little... A l-little... Wow... Damn, Eva... Your body is...        perfect...                                                                                          Eva: *Giggles* Thank you... I was hoping I’d be to your liking...                                   Orion: You definitely are...                                                                        Eva: Then I guess you must be ready for some... further relaxation...                               Orion: You bet I am...                                                                              Eva: Then let's not waste any more time. I'm sure there are a lot of things you’d like to do on your first day in Eternum.                                                                              Orion: Everything else can wait... right now you’ve got my full attention...                        Eva: *Unzipping your zip* Now, that's the spirit, baby... I always say that in Eternum, only the now is what matt– Wow... My god, Orion...                                                              Orion: What's the matter?                                                                           Eva: It's... It's huge... I've never seen one so big...                                             Orion: Oh... Is that a problem?                                                                     Eva: *Giggles* Maybe... I don’t know what to do with all of you... But I think it’s a problem I’d   love to solve... Mmmm...                                                                            Orion: Oh god...                                                                                    Eva: Your scent is captivating... Orion. Mmmmh...                                                   Orion: Oh yeah...                                                                                   Eva: MMMmmmmmhh...                                                                                  Orion: Ohhhh... FUCK...                                                                             Eva: MMmmmmMMmm...                                                                                  Orion: Oh my fucking god... Y-You feel amazing! Please, don't stop...                               Eva: Mmmm...                                                                                        Orion: Oh yeah... (I can feel her tongue... Gliding all over me... I love it...) Ohhhh... fuck...   Oh, fuck, Eva... I don't know about "the other world", but this feels incredible... Right here,     right now...                                                                                        Eva: Mmmm...                                                                                        Orion: Oh yes... Oh shit, I'm about to cum... I can't hold it...                                    Eva: *Gasping for air* Aaaahh...                                                                    Orion: Ohh...                                                                                       Eva: N-No... Don't cum just yet...                                                                  Orion: What?                                                                                        Eva: I’m not done with you... I want to feel you... inside me...                                    Orion: WHAT?! (OH SHIT, THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING!)                                                  Eva: I want... I need you to fuck me... please... I have to know how it feels to ride such a big    cock...                                                                                             Orion: Yes...                                                                                       Eva: I’m not supposed to be doing this...                                                           Orion: Doing what?                                                                                  Eva: *Removing her veil* Having sex. A blowjob is supposed to be our most intimate interaction with clients, and only on the most special occasions. This is... something personal. And also strictly   forbidden... So please, don't tell Miss Ambrose...                                                  Orion: My lips are sealed...                                                                        Eva: Thank you, Orion... Ahhhh...                                                                   Orion: Oh my god...                                                                                 Eva: AAAa-a-argh... F-Fuck...                                                                       Orion: Oh my god...                                                                                 Eva: It's so big...                                                                                 Orion: You're so fucking tight, Eva...                                                              Eva: Stretch it... Let me take all of you in, Orion... Aaahh... Aaahh... F-Fuck... It feels so much better than I thought... I've never f-felt so full in all my life...                                Orion: Oh my god, Eva... This is amazing...                                                         Eva: Go faster... I want to feel you deeper... Give it to me hard... D-DEEPER... AAAARRGHH...       T-That's it! AaAaaahh... Yeah! J-Just like that! Oh my fucking god, keep going! Please... please... don't stop! Aaaahh... ahh... ahhhh... Keep going, baby... AAAAAHHHH...                              Orion: Oh my g-god... Your pussy feels incredible...                                                Eva: I can’t get enough of you, baby... Aaahhh...  Fuck, I'm about to finish... Give me every inch, Orion!                                                                                              Orion: Don't stop riding it...                                                                      Eva: Aaahhh... AAahhh... Ahhh... Yeah... YEAH!                                                      Orion: AAAAH... Fuck... I... I can’t hold it...                                                     Eva: I think I’m gonna cum...                                                                       Orion: Ahhh... Y-Your pussy is squeezing...                                                         Eva: Your cock is driving me insane... Aaaahhhhhh... I c-can't... A-A-AAAARGHHH... AAaahhh... Oh my god...                                                                                              Orion: I'm about to cum too...                                                                      Eva: Come here, baby... Cum on my face... Cover me with your seed...                                Orion: Ohh, fuck... AAAARGH... Ahhh... yeahhhh...                                                   Eva: *Recovering her breath* Oh my fucking god... That was... insane... How are you so good?        Orion: Am I? I don't know, I didn't do anything special... I just let myself go. I was trying to    avoid cumming too early more than anything else. Which was... not an easy thing to do, considering  that you're unbelievably hot. I'm sorry I made a mess of you.                                       Eva: No, no... I wanted it... it’s exactly what I needed... Wow! Ahh Orion, this is not how I was   expecting the day to go.                                                                            Orion: Me neither, I can assure you...                                                              Eva: I have to go back to the hall, but... Let me tell you that I enjoyed our time together... a    lot. *Giggles* Maybe more than you.                                                                 Orion: *Laughs* More than me? I doubt that. So... Um, should I pay now, or...                       Eva: It's ok, you can go.                                                                           Orion: What? I don't have to pay?                                                                   Eva: No, don't worry. I got as much out of this as you did. This one's on the house, Orion. You've  definitely earned it...                                                                             Orion: Wow, thanks Eva... Are you sure, though? Will Madam Ambrose be okay with this?               Eva: Probably not, but I'll handle it. Just be sure she doesn't see you on your way out.            Orion: Alright... Then I guess I’ll be going.                                                       Eva: Goodbye, Orion. And thank you...                                                               Orion: Will I see you again?                                                                        Eva: Well... I guess that depends on you.                                                           Orion: If I come back to Aphrodite's, will you still be working here?                               Eva: Maybe I will... maybe I won’t... No one can know their future. In any case, although Eternum is a vast world... It has an odd way of bringing people back together again...                        Orion: Ok then... Goodbye Eva...                                                                    Eva: Take care... Orion.                                                                            Orion: (OH MY GOD! Holy shit, what just happened?! Fuck, that was incredible... I wonder if Eva...) Annie: Orion...                                                                                     Orion: *Turning around* AAARGH! ANNIE! I UHH WAS JUST LOOKING FOR YOU! NOT DOING ANYTHING WEIRD,    NOPE! I WENT TO... T-THE HUMAN TAXIDERMIST! *Turning around* Hmm? Annie! Huh? Why the long face?    What happened?                                                                                      Annie: The sword... I didn't get it...                                                              Orion: What sword?                                                                                  Annie: The one that was supposed to be my gift to you... Someone broke into Kitty's garage. They    stole everything!                                                                                   Orion: Oh... Come on Annie, it doesn't matter! I don't need it. I'll get another weapon!            Annie: But I wanted to give it to you... I've been waiting so long to finally play Eternum together, and now I...                                                                                       Orion: Annie, seriously, stop it. You generously gave me a bunch of eternals, you kindly shared your favorite server with me, and you’ve been showing me the ropes! You've done more than enough. I know it might sound cheesy, but you being here with me is the best gift I could’ve received.            Annie: R-Really?                                                                                    Orion: I mean it.                                                                                   Annie: T-Thank you Orion! You really know what to say to make a girl feel better...                 Orion: *Chuckles* Hey, I’m only speaking the truth here.                                            Annie: So tell me, what have you been up to? I’ve been gone for awhile... wasn’t expecting things to take this long.                                                                                    Orion: M-Me? N-Not much. Not much, I’ve just been waiting around here. Oh yeah, I bought something! Annie: Oh, cool! What did you buy?                                                                  Orion: A shovel.                                                                                    Annie: A... what?                                                                                   Orion: Chop-Chop told me it's called the Shovel of Destiny. I'm sure it'll be useful someday.       Annie: *Laughs*                                                                                     Orion: What are you laughing at?                                                                    Annie: Nothing, it just looks like a rusty hunk of junk to me! But hey, maybe you're right and it'll be useful someday.                                                                                 Orion: I'm sure of it! I can hear future-Orion thanking me already!                                 Annie: *Laughs* You always know how to make me laugh.                                               Orion: The more I get you to close your eyes in laughter, the lesser the chance you’ll be able to   see my unintentional stupidity! *Evil laugh*                                                        Annie: *Laughs* Come on, let's go to the portal. It's time for us to head out.                      Orion: Lead the way! A pistol.                                                                      Annie: A what?                                                                                      Orion: I uhh... don’t want to talk about it. I think I might’ve gotten swindled already. Chop-Chop  sold it to me, proclaiming it as the best thing ever, but turns out it’s just a hunk of broken      junk.                                                                                               Annie: *Laughs*                                                                                     Orion: What are you laughing at?                                                                    Annie: Nothing! It's just that...                                                                   Orion: Check it out! It looks like an old pistol, but it's a really cool laser gun! I'm sure it'll  be useful someday.                                                                                  Annie: *Laughs*                                                                                     Orion: What are you laughing at?                                                                    Annie: Well you’re right, that’s definitely a laser gun. It’s a vintage model 300B that’s           practically an antique. You might as well throw away that paperweight though. I can tell from here  that it’s broken and they unfortunately can't be repaired.                                          Orion: Goddamn you, Chop-Chop... “only top-quality”, my ass!                                        Annie: *Laughs* You always know how to make me laugh.                                               Orion: The more I get you to close your eyes in laughter, the lesser the chance you’ll be able to   see my unintentional stupidity! *Evil laugh*                                                        Annie: * Laughs* Come on, let's go to the portal. It's time for us to head out.                     Orion: Lead the way! Remember the glasses? I bought them.                                           Annie: Oh, cool. Do they do anything special?                                                       Orion: Um, no not really... But they look cool right? I’ll be the trailblazer of Eternum fashion    with these bad boys! (Hehe, another little look won't hurt anyone... Hehe, a little look won't hurt anyone... Mmm mmm... Oh yeah...) What?                                                               Critical system failure – Error code: 42069. Please contact manufacturer at: -----                 Orion: (What! There isn’t even a number listed! Goddamn you, Chop-Chop... “only top-quality”, my    ass!)                                                                                               Annie: Something wrong?                                                                             Orion: No, don't worry... *Sighs* Anyway, we should get going.                                      Annie: Come on, let's go to the portal. It's time for us to head out.                               Orion: Lead the way! Well, I didn't know what to buy for myself, so I got something for you instead.Annie: What? F-For me?                                                                              Orion: Yeah, the storekeeper said it's called the "Pendant of Destiny". He mentioned it’ll bring    good luck to the girl who wears it. I'll be honest, I think I might’ve gotten swindled, but... Well, this world is pretty magical, so who knows. Might be worth keeping. You're probably thinking I     shouldn't have spent money on such snake oil, but...                                                Annie: I love it!                                                                                   Orion: Really?                                                                                      Annie: Thank you so much Orion! I'll carry this with me forever!                                    Orion: I hope it really works then!                                                                 Annie: I l– Erm... Y-You're the best friend ever!                                                   Orion: I'm glad you like it, Annie. Alright then, we should get going!                              Annie: Yes! Let's head over to the portal! I'll show you the path!                                  Orion: Lead the way!                                                                                Annie: Ok, here we are. This right here is an exit portal.                                          Orion: Yeah, I remember asking Idriel about it. If you leave the game without using one of these,   you’ll lose everything, right?                                                                      Annie: Correct! You have to use it to leave the game, or else all your hard work will go down the   drain.                                                                                              Orion: Got it. And how do you use it?                                                               Annie: You just have to...                                                                          Girl: HELP!                                                                                         Annie: W-What?                                                                                      Orion: Did you hear that too?                                                                       Annie: Someone screamed...                                                                          Orion: Yeah... A girl. It came from over there.                                                     Annie: Should we go investigate?                                                                    Orion: Yeah... I think so. She could be hurt!                                                       Annie: You're right...                                                                              Orion: It came from over here...                                                                    Benjamin: *Laughs* Come on, a little closer now...                                                  Orion: (That voice...)                                                                              Girl: Seriously, I have to go...                                                                    Benjamin: You're not going anywhere until we're done talking.                                       Orion: Oh shit, not this guy again... I know that motherfucker, it's that Benjamin punk.            Annie: Benjamin?! Oh no...                                                                          Orion: Do you know him?                                                                             Annie: Yeah, everyone in school knows him. Axel's lap dog. Are you two friends?                     Orion: Not exactly. He introduced his fist to my face earlier today, right after swim class. The son of a bitch almost broke my nose.                                                                   Annie: Yeah, he and Axel have a reputation for being aggressive... Even some teachers are afraid of those two. They're untouchable because Axel's father subsidizes the school.                         Orion: Fucking bastards...                                                                          Benjamin: Scream all you want... No one can hear you from this side of the city...                  Girl: L-Look Benja, I had a lot of fun today, b-but I gotta go...                                   Benjamin: Bitch, you've been flirting with me nonstop at the club... dancing and rubbing your ass   against my dick. And now you want to leave me here with blue-balls? No, you don't get to do that... Girl: I... I'd love to stay with you, b-but if I don't disconnect, my mom will yell at me.          Benjamin: *Laughs* Your mom? Bitch, you almost ate my dick on the dance floor. You can't dress like a slut, cover your skin with lewd tattoos, and then pretend to be a goodie goodie mommy's girl. Up  until a few minutes ago, you were giving me nothing but “fuck me” eyes...                           Girl: W-Well, I wasn’t trying to give you that impression... I'm s-sorry.                           Orion: This is making me sick. We have to do something. Can't you scare him away, Annie? I'm sure   you're stronger than Benjamin in this world.                                                        Annie: Yeah, but... he's Axel's friend! The son of William Bardot! I could beat him easily, but then he'd tell Axel, and Axel would tell his father, and then he'd use his power within the company to  ban me from Eternum forever! I... can't afford to lose this game, Orion! I've spent the last 3 years of my life playing and I don't want to lose it all!                                                Orion: Shit, you're right... We're fucked...                                                        Girl: Ok, I need to go to the portal now. Um... We c-can meet again tomorrow. I'll...               Benjamin: Nah, you're not going anywhere!                                                           Girl: N-NO! Let me go!                                                                              Benjamin: *Laughs* Don't worry babe, it'll be fun... for me, at least... I'm sure you're wet as     fuck... Don't lie to me...                                                                          Intervene                                                                                           Orion: (Fuck, I can't let him do this...) Ok, I'm going in. I'll try to knock him down before he    notices me.                                                                                         Annie: But if he sees you and tells Axel, you won't ever be able to play again! This was your dream!Orion: I can't just stand by and watch him rape that poor girl. I can only imagine what I would do  if you were in her shoes. I can't let it happen.                                                    Annie: I... You're right. I wish I was as brave as you are. I'll attack too!                        Orion: No. You have much more to lose, Annie. Promise me you'll stay here.                          Annie: But...                                                                                       Orion: Promise me.                                                                                  Annie: O-Okay, I promise...                                                                         Stay out of it                                                                                      Orion: (Fuck, I can't do anything... I don't wanna be banned... I've been waiting for the chance to play Eternum my whole life...)                                                                      Benjamin: Oh yeah... Can you feel my dick against your ass, babe?                                   Girl: *Crying* Please let me go!                                                                    Benjamin: *Laughs* Shh... your protests are useless. I'm gonna put it inside... You won’t be crying anymore once you feel my big fat cock going in and out of you...                                    Girl: *Crying* N-No, please, STOP!                                                                  Benjamin: *Laughs*                                                                                  Orion: (He seems distracted now. With a bit of luck, I'll be able to knock him down without being   seen. If I manage to do that, he won't know who attacked him, and I won't be banned. I’ll attack    in... 3... 2... 1... Now! Fuck, I feel so powerless right now. Maybe we can go back to the square   and ask for help. If someone...)                                                                    Praetorian: *Releasing steam*                                                                       Orion: What the... What the hell is that...                                                         Annie: A... A P-Praetorian.                                                                         Orion: A Praetorian? Oh yeah, they’re...                                                            Annie: Eternum's police... I've never seen one on duty.                                             Praetorian: *Standing up* Benjamin Dawson, Eternum ID 289,008,551. Put your hands up and back away  from the girl.                                                                                      Benjamin: W-What? You have got to be kidding me... A fucking Praetorian! Man, I feel like a         celebrity! Did I do something wrong, cupcake?                                                       Praetorian: You are in violation of code 261-E. Rape and sexual assault.                            Benjamin: Oh no, I'm so scared...                                                                   Orion: That motherfucker is still as cocky as always... I hope they throw him out of the game. Or   the server, at least.                                                                               Praetorian: You've committed crimes against Eternum's General Code of Ethics. You’re coming with me.Benjamin: *Laughs* Why? Do you want your turn with me behind those trash cans?                      Praetorian: Your session is to be terminated and you will be disconnected from the server. Your file will be analyzed by an Ethics Jury to determine if you may return to the game.                     Benjamin: Yeah, sure. I'm sorry to cut you off, but I've been through this before. I'll tell you    exactly what will happen. That fucking jury of yours is going to ban me, but then I'm gonna talk    with William Bardot. The ban will get reversed, I’ll come back to the game, and then I’ll make sure that whole piece of shit jury panel gets fired. You’re messing with the wrong guy. I'm the best     friend of William Bardot’s son.                                                                     Praetorian: We are well-aware of your character file, Benjamin.                                     Benjamin: Does his name ring a bell? The second-in-command after The Founder? Ulysses' biggest      shareholder? *Laughs* Shit, I've even taken a fat dump in his fucking house before. So... Why don't we save ourselves all the paperwork and you leave me alone?                                         Praetorian: Accompany me without resistance or I will be forced to take drastic action.             Benjamin: Oh shit, yeah, I forgot you're a fucking AI. Can I talk to a real person, please? Is      anybody on the other side? Hello?? I want to speak with a fucking human.                            Praetorian: If you keep resisting, you will be excommunicated.                                      Benjamin: *Sighs* It's like talking to a wall. Don't give a person's job to a fucking machine...    Girl: F-Fuck this shit, I'm out!                                                                    Benjamin: Yeah, run away... bitch.                                                                  Praetorian: Proceed with me to the nearest exit portal. This is your last warning.                  Benjamin: *Taking his dick out* I have a better idea. Why don't we take advantage of that huge ass  your designers gave you? I'll put that thing to good use... We'll go behind those trash cans, you'll kneel down... And then you'll start sucking my fat...                                              Praetorian: Reporting nearby units. Player number 289,008,551 has been excommunicated.

His head was disintegrated...)                                               Annie: I guess now we can...

Orion: Ahh! (Oof... Back in the real world, Orion. Ok, I have to admit... that was... FUCKING       AWESOME! Eternum exceeded all my expectations... Man, I even got laid! On my first day! Jeez,       raining again? Damn Kredon... I don't know how long I've been playing, but now I'm starving. I'm    gonna go to the kitchen.)                                                                           Annie: Orion!                                                                                       Orion: Annie! *Chuckles* It's weird to see you with your hair short again.                          Annie: *Laughs* I can imagine! How was the log off? Did you disconnect smoothly?                    Orion: Yeah, sure. Much better than logging in. Damn, that sure was intense! For a second there, I  thought we’d be goners.                                                                             Annie: Nah, you shouldn't fear the Praetorians. They're there to protect us. Some people believe    they can do whatever they want in Eternum without consequences, and that's simply not true. We      didn't have to hide after they took care of Benjamin. They knew we weren’t involved.                Orion: I guess not, sorry about that. They look intimidating, and my instinct told me to run and    hide. They have nice asses, though. Maybe that's what confused me. I felt... scaroused.             Annie: *Laughs* Yeah, there's no denying that.                                                      Orion: And what’s going to happen with Benjamin? "Excommunicated"?                                  Annie: Yep. He won't be able to play Eternum ever again. It’s an irrevocable ban. Even Axel's dad   will have trouble undoing that.                                                                     Orion: Hehe! Serves him right for what he did. I hope that never happens to us, though... Anyway,   let's have some supper!                                                                             Annie: Sure! Let's go.                                                                              Orion: Alright, I got the dishwasher running! Everything was delicious! I can’t remember the last   time I had salmon.                                                                                  Annie: And then he starts saying stuff like "I want to talk to a person...", "I wanna speak with a  human, not a fucking AI..." And the Praetorian stood there like this, without moving an inch.       *Imitating the Praetorian's metallic voice* "If you keep resisting, you will be excommunicated".    "This is your last warning". And he says: "I don't give a shit, why don't you suck my..." BANG! His entire head vanished!                                                                               Penelope: Damn, those Praetorians sound badass.                                                     Annie: Oh, they are!                                                                                Penelope: And from what you’ve said, it sounds like that guy deserved it.                           Annie: Oh yeah, totally. The game will be much better off without him.                              Penelope: Video games have never been my thing, but I have to admit, this one sounds fun. If I get a modeling job, I’ll get myself a neural implant too. I promise.                                     Annie: That would be awesome!                                                                       Orion: I heard that promise, Penny! Too late to back out now! I'm gonna find you a modeling job, and then you'll have to buy it!                                                                        Annie: Well, I'm off to bed. Thank you so much for playing with me, Orion. It means a lot.          Orion: The pleasure was all mine, Annie. Eternum is awesome. I’m so grateful I had you by my side.  Goodnight!                                                                                          Annie: Night!                                                                                       Orion: So... another Eternum player, huh?                                                           Penelope: I said only if I get a modeling job!                                                      Orion: I'll get you one!                                                                            Penelope: *Laughs* Are you my manager now?                                                          Orion: Well, I recommended you take that photo at the cafe the other day. Speaking of that, did you post the photo?                                                                                     Penelope: Yep, and I have to admit you were right. It's my most liked and commented post already.   Orion: See?! I told you! And that's quite an accomplishment, you have some really nice pics there.  Penelope: Oh, have you seen them?                                                                   Orion: Yeah, I made a temporary account. "Throwaway2736" or something like that.                    Penelope: *Laughs* No way, that was you?! You were the one who liked all my photos last night!      Orion: Oh... Did you see that? Um...                                                                Penelope: *Laughs* No worries, it's okay! Thanks for supporting me, I appreciate it.                Orion: *Laughs* I'm not a simp, I promise. You have some truly beautiful pics. I enjoyed your entire profile. It’s very artistic.                                                                       Penelope: Thank you! Are you into photography?                                                      Orion: I definitely am, if that means I could have a model like you.                                Penelope: Mm...                                                                                     Orion: (Oh shit, did I go too far with the compliments?)                                            Penelope: You know, I'm going to a photography studio this Sunday. I was supposed to go with a      friend of mine, but... If you're interested...                                                      Go with her                                                                                         Orion: I'd love to come!                                                                            Penelope: Really? Great! I'll tell him not to come then. You'll be my personal photographer for the day. You know, I'm not gonna lie, when Mom told me that you and Annie were gonna live with us for a while, I got a little annoyed. But hey, I’m glad to say I was wrong. Both of you breathe so much    life into this house. It almost feels like you've always lived here.                                Orion: Thank you, Penelope. It means a lot hearing that from you.                                   Don't go                                                                                            Orion: Well, you should probably go with him instead. He’s probably a way better photographer than I am.                                                                                                Penelope: Y-Yeah, of course, you're right. How... silly of me. Anyway, I'll go to bed too.          Goodnight, Orion.                                                                                   Orion: Good night! (I should do the same. Playing Eternum is way more tiring than I thought. I'll   say good night to Nancy and Dalia, then go to sleep. There she is. Damn, still working. Jesus       Christ, look at that nightwear... How am I supposed to not look at her cleavage when I'm talking to her?! Ok, Orion. You can do it. Just look her in the eyes. You're not a horny teenager. Show her    you're a man now. She works too mu- What the...) Nancy?                                             Nancy: Orion! W-W-What a surprise! I t-thought you were sleeping already!                           Orion: Um... No, but I was just about to head to bed.                                               Nancy: Good! Sleeping is important! Very important! I was about to get some rest myself, too.       Orion: Mm-hm.                                                                                       Nancy: I was... finishing something from work. These damn ads!                                      Orion: You should install an ad-blocker.                                                            Nancy: Oh yeah, that’s a good idea! I can’t stand seeing all those... weird pop-ups. Ahem... So...  Yeah, I hope you get a good night's sleep.                                                          Orion: Yeah, being involved in a lot of sports helps me to sleep really well.                       Nancy: That’s great! The same thing happens to me when I do yoga!                                   Orion: I didn’t know you did yoga! That’s cool, I’ve always wanted to try it.                       Nancy: Perfect! You could come to my yoga class this Saturday! It’s nice to get away from these...  frustrating computers and their annoying ads.                                                       Orion: Join your yoga class?                                                                        Go with her                                                                                         Orion: Sure, that sounds fun!                                                                       Nancy: Oh, it is! I'll show you all of my secret techniques! Like the Crested Crane pose!           Orion: *Laughs* The Crested Crane pose?                                                             Nancy: Oh yeah! It channels the bad energies away, revealing your true animal spirit.               Orion: Sounds good. I can't wait to try those... poses.                                             Don't go                                                                                            Orion: Well, I'm not sure if yoga is for me. I’m about as flexible as a log. I prefer the gym.      Nancy: Oh... Y-Yeah, that's nice too. A strong boy definitely must spend a lot of time in the gym.  *Faking a yawn* Ohh! I'm so sleepy! Well, time to go to bed! Good night, Orion! I'll see you        tomorrow!                                                                                           Orion: Night Nancy! Hmm... (Yeah, she was definitely watching porn... Looks like I'm not the only   one in this house who's horny... Interesting...) Dalia, I'm going to my room! Are you in the        bathroom? The door is open! I don't want to cause another misunderstanding...                       Dalia: Yeah, yeah, good night! Get out of my way!                                                   Orion: Hmm? Why the rush?                                                                           Dalia: I’ve been waiting so long for this day!                                                      Orion: What day? Is that Eternum's E-Suit? Are you about to log on?                                 Dalia: You can bet your ass I'm gonna play! I found it! Finally! I discovered the location for one  of the 10 Gems of Doom!                                                                             Orion: What?!                                                                                       Dalia: I've located the guys who have it. The 6th Gem! And I've prepared a trap for them! That Gem  will soon be mine!                                                                                  Orion: Holy shit! This is so exciting! Let me help you!                                             Dalia: No.                                                                                          Orion: What?! Come on, Dalia!                                                                       Dalia: I said no.                                                                                   Orion: But I can help!                                                                              Dalia: You just barely played for the first time today. You're a noob.                              Orion: Come on! I know enough now!                                                                  Dalia: Oh please, you didn’t even know what the Gems were until you spoke with Idriel today!        Orion: Um... Ok, maybe, but since then it's been my dream to get one! Please, Dalia! Please!        Dalia: No!                                                                                          Orion: What have you got to lose? Worst case, I die and you can still continue the mission without  me!                                                                                                 Dalia: Hmmmm... Okay, okay, I guess another set of helping hands wouldn’t hurt...                   Orion: Yes!                                                                                         Dalia: But if I lose the Gem because of you, you're dead! And I'm not just talking about the game!  Orion: I won't fail you!                                                                            Dalia: You better not! Fine... Go to your room and log on. I'll send you an invitation. And hurry   up! We have to be off that server in 30 minutes! Gem in hand!                                       Orion: We'll do it in 20! (Oh damn, this is exciting! Annie and Dalia seem to be really good        players... If we somehow managed to gather all the Gems... Oh boy... We'd become filthy rich! Ok,   let's see if I can plug this thing in myself... Alright...)                                         Connected. Welcome back to Eternum. You've received an invitation from... Dalia. Would you like to  join her session?                                                                                   Orion: Yes!                                                                                         Please prepare to connect...                                                                        Orion: Hmm... yeah, I think I’m all set...                                                          The game will launch in 5 seconds.                                                                  Orion: Cool, let me... Arghh... (Fuck... Holy crap, t-that's it? Am I inside the game already?!     Jesus Christ, Annie was right... Everything went so much faster compared to my first log in. I      didn’t even notice the game loading... How is that possible?!)                                      Dalia: Hello there, wanderer.                                                                       Orion: Dalia! Where are we?                                                                         Dalia: Ekabar. Well, a dungeon of Ekabar—I placed a log-in unit here a couple of days ago, so you   don't have to start at the nexus. It's probably not the nicest spot for first impressions of the    server, but oh well, this isn't supposed to be a sightseeing tour anyway. Come on, get up! Don’t    just sit there! We’re running out of time!                                                          Orion: Wow, cool armor! That looks awesome!                                                         Dalia: Oh... Yeah, thanks.                                                                          Orion: That must weigh a lot.                                                                       Dalia: Yep, it does. Good thing I’ve been hitting the gym. I don’t think I’d be able to lug all this weight around if I didn’t!                                                                         Orion: It looks so good on you.                                                                     Dalia: Yeah... You, on the other hand...                                                            Orion: I... Oh, come on, really?! A fucking loin-cloth?! This is even worse than Ion's outfit.      Dalia: *Laughs* Yeah, I doubt it'll offer you much protection. You'll have to depend exclusively on your ability.                                                                                       Orion: Yeah, I guess I don’t have much of a choice...                                               Dalia: Alright, let's sit at this table for a minute!                                               Orion: So... Ekabar, you say?                                                                       Dalia: Yeah! It's my favorite server. I've always been a big fan of medieval fantasy ever since I   was a kid.                                                                                          Orion: Is this world pretty large? Ion seemed pretty huge to me.                                    Dalia: Oh, this one is even bigger! I've spent thousands of hours in Ekabar and every day I still   keep discovering new locations and secrets.                                                         Orion: Damn, that sounds awesome. And what can you find in this world?                              Dalia: Well, you know, the usual stuff. Quaint villages and towering castles. Knights, and          princesses. Elves and dwarves. From mighty dragons, hideous ogres, and ruthless vampires... to      majestic unicorns, kinky pixies, and sexy mermaids.                                                 Orion: Oh my god, I love Ekabar already. I can't wait to see all that...                            Dalia: But not today. We’re only here for one thing, remember? We’ve got a mission to accomplish and you insisted on joining.                                                                           Orion: Oh shit, the Gem of Doom, yeah, of course. Don't worry Dalia, we'll get it. Me and my humble loin-cloth are at your service. What do we need to do? Actually, why are we even sitting here? Come on, let's go!                                                                                       Dalia: Well, we're sitting here because we have to wait for someone.                                Orion: Hmm? Someone?                                                                                Dalia: Yeah, a guy that I met a few months ago.                                                     Orion: (A guy...?)                                                                                  Dalia: We did a quest together and now he comes along to help me sometimes. His magic abilities are great... But he's always late. If he's late today too, I'm gonna kill him myself.                   Orion: Well, maybe we don't need him.                                                               Dalia: As much as I hate to say it, yeah, we do. The Gem is held by two twins... Con and Xet. If we split 'em up, we can defeat them easily, but together they're too strong. I need Jerry for this     mission.                                                                                            Orion: Jerry? Why does that name sound so familiar...                                               Dalia: Ah, finally. That must be him.                                                               Jerry: M'lady, Sir Jermaine of Noriander at your service. How shall I serve you today?              Dalia: Yeah, yeah, cut the shit, Jerry. We have work to do. Sit down already.                       Jerry: Oh my goodness, I never thought you could be more beautiful, but tonight you are just        breathtaking, Dalia. Is that gleaming armor new? It complements the shine of your gorgeous hair so  well...                                                                                             Dalia: It isn't, and you know it.                                                                   Jerry: Do you have a map? I just keep getting lost in your eyes... Hmm? Who's this noob? And why    does he look so familiar?                                                                           Orion: Hey... I know you... You're the guy from Loco's Cafe, the captain of the first team!         Jerry: Oh... yeah... you're that bastard who cheated and won the prize!                             Orion: You're already an Eternum player? Why the fuck did you want another neural implant?!         Jerry: Duh, that shit costs $2,500, numb nuts. Money is money.                                      Orion: What? You're so fucking selfish.                                                             Dalia: Ah, I see you know each other. Good, that will save us time.                                 Jerry: Yeah, my girl is right. Now stay quiet and let us discuss the mission.                       Orion: W-What? Y-Your girl? Are you two dating?                                                     Jerry: Oh my god, poor guy... You didn't know? Yeah, Dalia's my girlfriend. Or soul mate, if I’m    being more precise.                                                                                 Orion: You two...                                                                                   Dalia: What?! W-What the fuck are you talking about? We're not dating!                              Jerry: Yeah, well, we’re not one for labels and I’d prefer not to limit our deep connection due to  silly social constructs. But... to put it in layman’s terms for you, let's just say we're “friends  with benefits”, if you know what I mean.                                                            Dalia: What benefits?! We've never done anything!                                                   Jerry: I don't know... 2 days ago she couldn’t keep her hands off me. It was quite perfect,         actually... a romantic night under the starlit sky...                                               Dalia: What?! I grabbed your hand 'cause you were about to fall off a cliff!                        Jerry: Yeah, but she did it so sensually... it’s almost as if she was trying to grasp my heart... my soul... I'm sure you know what I mean, Orion...                                                    Orion: . . .                                                                                        Dalia: Okay, that's enough! We're here to obtain one of the Gems of Doom and we’re wasting precious time!                                                                                               Jerry: Yes!                                                                                         Dalia: Okay, here's the plan. I prepared a trap to attract Con and Xet to this dungeon. They're     gonna split up because of a spell I set yesterday. We have to take them down individually, before   they manage to regroup. Remember, they possess a paralyzing spell that will restrict all movement.  Don't let them cast it! Orion and I are gonna stay here. Con should come by these cells at any time. Jerry, you're gonna go upstairs and buy us some time by distracting Xet. When we defeat Con, we're gonna join you upstairs and help with the other twin. One of them must be carrying around the Gem of Doom. If we defeat them both, the Gem will be ours. Is that understood?                            Jerry: Perfectly put, m’lady. I was just about to suggest the same exact plan. It’s amazing how     similar our thought processes are. It’s as if we’re perfectly in-sync, like a brilliantly executed  ballroom dance... You can trust me. These dancing shoes won't fail you, my love.                    Orion: . . .                                                                                        Jerry: To the top floor! The Gems of Doom will be ours! FOR ETERNUM!                                Dalia: Okay, since you’re here to help, we can work on an ambush. We'll wait for Con to appear, then I'll face him as if I didn't know about his paralyzing power. After he paralyzes me, there will be an exact moment when he’s concentrating completely on the spell. During that moment, he’ll be too   focused to see or hear anything else. That’s when you'll attack him from behind. If you do it at the right time, he won't even notice you coming. I'll say the keyword "moron" for you to know when to  attack. Not a second before, and not a second after. So pay close attention! Any questions?         Orion: Um... Yeah... So... Is it true that you and Jerry are dating?                                Dalia: W-What?! Questions about the mission.                                                        Orion: Oh my god, so it's true...                                                                   Dalia: No! Of course not! I already said he's just a friend. And... not even that, to be honest. He just happens to help me out sometimes.                                                              Orion: Oh... thank god. I mean... you deserve better.                                               Dalia: Yeah, okay, thanks.                                                                          Orion: So... that means you probably have a boyfriend, right? That's why you’re turning down Jerry’s advances?                                                                                          Dalia: No! I... I don't have any boyfriend. I rejected Jerry because he's an idiot.                 Orion: Oh... ok. (Thank god...)                                                                     Dalia: W-Why do you even care? Why so many questions?!                                              Orion: N-No good reason, I just got curious.                                                        Dalia: Oh, yeah? And what about you? Do you have a girlfriend?                                      Orion: Me? Nope. I'm not seeing anyone. Why do you ask...?                                          Dalia: B-Because! I just wanted to make you see how uncomfortable an interrogation is!              Orion: Oh, I don't mind.                                                                            Dalia: Well, I do feel uncomfortable, so... *Whispering* Oh shit! That must be Con! He's here!      Quickly, hide in one of the cells! And remember the plan!                                           Orion: T-The plan, yeah! (Ok... Let's do this. I can't fail Dalia. I have to attack when she says   the keyword. What was the word...?)                                                                 Con: Oh shit, where am I now? Xet? You there? *Sighs* I knew that fucking letter was a scam. We     shouldn't have come here...                                                                         Dalia: Stop right there, Con!                                                                       Con: Hmm?                                                                                           Dalia: Look, we can do this the easy way, or we can do it the hard way. You choose.                 Con: *Laughs* Oh no, an ambush! What am I gonna do... I’m so scaaaared... *Turning around* Oh...    it's a girl...                                                                                      Dalia: Yeah, it is. Let me make things simple for you. You're gonna hand over the Gem of Doom and   then I’ll let you go unharmed. I’m going to get it either way, so save yourself from some pain...   Con: Ohh... Where did you discover that we have one of the Gems?                                    Dalia: I have my contacts.                                                                          Con: I see... And how are you gonna take it, if I may ask?                                          Dalia: Easy. I'll... W-What? I can't move! Why?!                                                    Con: HAHAHA! You're under the control of my paralysis spell. You won't be able to move until I      decide so.                                                                                          Dalia: What? Impossible!                                                                            Con: Get down on the ground!                                                                        Dalia: Son of a bitch...                                                                            Con: *Laughs* You're my puppet now, pretty...                                                       Dalia: Motherfucker...                                                                              Con: *Laughs* Did you think we just got lucky and stumbled upon a Gem of Doom by accident? No. It’s because we're invincible!                                                                           Dalia: Hah! You’re funny too, I see.                                                                Con: You haven't seen anything yet, baby.                                                           Dalia: FUCK! My armor! You broke it!                                                                Con: Yeah. Impressed?                                                                               Dalia: Grrr...                                                                                      Con: I'm sorry, that did look like a nice set, too. Hmm... You have a nice body, though. You can    take that compliment to the grave. I'd love to stay here with you, but I have to go. My brother must be waiting for me. Hey, at least you'll be able to say that you were killed by the man who gathered the 10 Gems of Doom and wielded the 3 Weapons of Atlas. Quite an honor.                            Dalia: You? Collecting the 10 Gems of Doom? The jokes just don’t stop with you...                   Con: You'll see, honey. You're in the presence of Eternum’s future king!                            Dalia: Future king, my ass. You're just a fucking moron!                                            Con: *Laughs* Well, time to end this.                                                               Dalia: I SAID... YOU'RE A FUCKING... MORON!                                                         Con: Yeah, I heard you the first time.                                                              Dalia: MORON!                                                                                       Con: Huh?                                                                                           Orion: (What? Oh shit! That was the keyword! I have to attack him!)                                 Con: *Laughs* Alright, let's...                                                                     Orion: Oh, shit... Did I hit him too hard?                                                          Dalia: Nice blow!                                                                                   Orion: Is he dead?! Oh fuck, I killed a man!                                                        Con: Huh? *Dodging*                                                                                 Orion: Oh, shit... AAARGH!                                                                          Con: What the fuck were you trying to do, loin-cloth peasant?! Next time don’t move so fast,        otherwise you’ll end up flashing me!                                                                Orion: F-Fuck, it hurts!                                                                            Con: That was pathetic! I CANNOT BE TAMED, FOR I AM THE–                                            Orion: Ohhh... Fuck, that hurt... *Standing up* Thank god you knocked him down, Dalia... Is he... is he dead? You killed him!                                                                           Dalia: Nah, he's not dead. Hey, you, wake up!                                                       Con: AAaargh... Motherfuckers... I swear you're going to pay for this...                            Dalia: Where's the Gem of Doom?                                                                     Con: My brother... has it...                                                                        Dalia: Fuck. Where's your brother?!                                                                 Con: . . .                                                                                          Dalia: Dammit, he passed out. Well, I'll go after his brother then since he has it. You wait here   and watch him, in case he wakes up. We might need to use him as a hostage if his brother tries to   run away.                                                                                           Orion: Wow, you don't get disconnected automatically if you lose consciousness in Eternum?          Dalia: Only after 60 minutes of inactivity. And the result is the same as if you had died—you lose  all your items and stats.                                                                           Orion: I see... Alright, I'll watch him, don't worry! By the way... What happened to your armor?    Dalia: Ah, don't worry. I knew a spell that allowed me to counter his paralysis, at the cost of     losing my armor. That was my backup plan, in case you didn’t come.                                  Orion: Sorry about your armor.                                                                      Dalia: Oh, yeah, no worries. Nothing that a blacksmith can't repair in exchange for some money. By  the way, nice job back there. That was a nice hammering. I'm impressed.                             Orion: Thanks! It was just like you said... he didn't see me coming. I just had to wait for your    signal.                                                                                             Dalia: Maybe we can do more missions together... You're not too bad of a teammate! Anyway, I'll go  get that damn bastard. I hope Jerry is still alive.                                                 Orion: (I wouldn’t mind if he wasn’t...) Sure! I'll be here, be careful.                            Dalia: Will do! Although... Maybe everything could have gone better if you had done what was        instructed. "Attack when I say the keyword "moron"... not a second before, and not a second after." Do you remember that?                                                                               Orion: Yeah... sorry, I got nervous.                                                                Dalia: *Sighs* Anyway, I'll go get that damn bastard, I hope Jerry is still alive.                  Orion: (I wouldn’t mind if he wasn’t...) Sure! I'll be here, be careful.                            Dalia: Yeah...                                                                                      Orion: Well, it's just the two of us now, buddy. Are you alright?                                   Con: . . .                                                                                          Orion: Hmm... (I should put him in a cell. This guy could have more than one trick up his sleeve.   Better safe than sorry.) Alright, make yourself comfortable, man. I'll be sitting right here, let me know if you need anything. Okay?                                                                   Con: . . .                                                                                          Orion: Mm-hm. (Well, got that job taken care of. Now I just have to wait for Dalia and that prick   Jerry. Man, it'd be awesome if we could get one of the 10 Gems of Doom. I know it's almost          impossible, but... Oh boy, imagine if it actually happened... Orion, CEO of Ulysses.) *Giggles*     (That sounds good! Money, fame, power, women... I'd have it all! Maybe with enough practice... Hmm? Is Dalia already back? Did she defeat the other twin already?) Hmm... (There's no one here... And   Con seems to be still in his cell... That's weird... I could have sworn I heard a door opening...)  Jerry: Hehehe... HEY MAN!                                                                           Orion: AAAAH! Son of a bitch, you scared me!                                                        Jerry: *Laughs*                                                                                     Orion: Where the hell did you come from?                                                            Jerry: I used my stealth techniques.                                                                Orion: And where's Dalia?!                                                                          Jerry: What?! She's not with you? You left the future mother of my children to fend for herself?    Orion: She went off to meet you! We already defeated one of the twins! Where the fuck is the other  one?! You were supposed to be distracting him!                                                      Jerry: I couldn't find the bastard. What was I supposed to do?!                                     Orion: Arrgh... Useless piece of garbage.                                                           Jerry: Anyway, it doesn't matter. Stay here. I'll go save Dalia.                                    Orion: What? No, you stay here, I'll go save her.                                                   Jerry: Excuse me? You're a fucking newbie. You can't do shit. Maybe focus on getting yourself a     decent outfit, you loin-cloth buffoon.                                                              Orion: I could probably do more than you!                                                           Jerry: *Sighs* You clearly don't know who I am, boy, so let me spell it out for you. This face ring a bell?                                                                                             Orion: Um... yes? The cafe?                                                                         Jerry: Not that. From interviews, television, internet.                                             Orion: Um...                                                                                        Jerry: I am a legend here. I am fucking level 39, kid.                                              Orion: And?                                                                                         Jerry: I've been playing this game since it was released. I defeated the Sisters of Fate. I won     Ekabar's Arcane Tournament last year. I found out the location of this Gem of Doom. And I'm about to discover Calypso's secret location. I just spend time with Dalia because she's my future wife,     Orion.                                                                                              Orion: Yeah, sure...                                                                                Jerry: Her power can't be compared to mine. But sometimes, love is the bridge that connects one     another. We fell in love at first sight. A king falling in love with a peasant... just like in the  fairytales. Really, I could have any girl I want... Dalia is just the lucky one I’ve set my eyes    on...                                                                                               Orion: She's not a peasant! And you're not a fucking king...                                        Jerry: I AM SIR JERMAINE OF NORIANDER, THY SAVIOR! EVERYONE KNOWETH MY NAME!                        Orion: . . .                                                                                        Jerry: I HAVE MASTERED ALL THINE ELEMENTS OF ETERNUM! I AM THE MOST TALENTED PLAYERETH OF THIS      COUNTRY...ETH! Look into my eyes, Orion... LOOK INTO THE EYES OF THE MAN WHO'S GONNA SIT ON THE     THRONE OF ETERNUM! KNEEL DOWN AND BOW DOWN BEFORE THE MAN WHO WILL...                               Orion: W-W-What... AAAAARGH! AAAAARGH! AAAAARGH! AAAAARGH! AAAAARGH! WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!! W-What is this fucking monster?! I h-have to get out of here! NOW! (I have to get out of here... I must   find the exit portal... Where is the fucking exit...)                                               Ogre: *Rumbles*                                                                                     Orion: F-Fuck! *Panting* (Upstairs! I have to go upstairs! The exit must be there...)               Ogre: *Rumbles*                                                                                     Orion: (F-Fuck! It's right behind me! How can he be so fucking big yet still so fast?! This         corridor! Yeah, that looks like an exit!) W-What?! Oh no... Why is this fucking part collapsed?!    Shit, I have to go back... *Turning around* Oh no... H-Hey lil buddy...! I... A-Are you protecting  this place or something?! I'm just a new player! I’m not trying to steal anything from here! Fuck!  NO! PLEASE, STOP! Oh my fucking god... (That was fucking amazing! She's... she's incredible... Man, I have to become as strong as her!) *Standing up* Dalia? Holy shit, that was unbelievable! Dalia!   Are you okay?!                                                                                      Dalia: *Coughs* I've been better...                                                                 Orion: Come here, let me help you... What happened? Did you run into another monster earlier?!      Dalia: Nah... It was Xet. He was stronger than I thought. He's much more clever than his brother.   Where's Jerry?                                                                                      Orion: H-He's dead. The ogre killed him.                                                            Dalia: Aww... Fucking idiot. I'm sure he was bragging about his level as always.                    Orion: But... You killed that monster with a single scythe stroke! You're strong as fuck! How could anyone be capable of hurting you?!                                                                  Dalia: *Laughs* First lesson of Eternum, Orion. Never become content with your strength or          abilities... never assume you’re at the top of the food chain... There's always a bigger fish...    *Coughs* Let's get out of here. I can't continue the fight like this. You have to help me reach the portal.                                                                                             Orion: Of course! There it is! The exit portal! We're almost there! Dalia!                          Dalia: Fuck... I can't go one step further. I think I broke a few of my ribs...                     Orion: What should we do?!                                                                          Dalia: Take me to the portal... Please... Once we leave the server, all of our wounds will be       healed.                                                                                             Orion: Ok, I'll carry you!                                                                          Dalia: . . .                                                                                        Orion: What's going on?                                                                             Dalia: T-T-The...                                                                                   Orion: Oh, damn... Who's that guy?  Wait, is he...                                                  Dalia: T-That's Xet...                                                                              Orion: What? But... I thought you said you couldn't beat him. That he was too strong.               Dalia: And he was... I... I didn't do this...                                                       Orion: What? Then who...                                                                            Dalia: H-He... It's impossible... He's exactly how people described him...                          Orion: Do you know him? W-Who is that guy?                                                          Dalia: That guy... is Thanatos.                                                                     Orion: Thanatos? Like in Greek mythology?                                                           Dalia: Y-Yes... He's a legend. He has the highest level in all Eternum. He... He has 3 Gems of Doom.Orion: W-What?! The Gems of Doom we've been talking about all day?! There are only 10 of them in all the fucking game... and a single guy already has 3?!                                               Dalia: Well... Now he has 4. You have to leave without me!                                          Orion: What?! I'm not leaving you behind!                                                           Dalia: YOU HAVE TO! He's gonna kill us both and then I'll lose everything I have! I don't give a    shit about my level, but just take my inventory! You can return it to me later! D-DO IT!            Grab Dalia's things and flee                                                                        Orion: F-Fuck... *Running away* (Am... am I really gonna leave Dalia behind? I don't know what he's gonna do to her... I...)                                                                            Stay                                                                                                Orion: No. I'm not gonna leave you here.                                                            Dalia: What?!                                                                                       Orion: Ever since I started playing this game, all I’ve ever done is run and scream. I'm not gonna  learn shit if I keep doing that. If I have to die and start all over again, so be it. But I'm not   running away again. So kill me already and let's be done with it.                                   Thanatos: Hmm. . . . *Leaves* *Leaves*                                                              Orion: He... He left! Oh, thank god! Dalia! He left! The guy just left! Are you alright?!           Dalia: L-Let's get out of here.                                                                     Orion: Yes! I'll bring you to the exit portal. Grab my arm! Damn, did you see how I intimidated him?Dalia: Oh please, he probably thought we weren't worth the effort and didn't want to waste any time on us.                                                                                              Orion: Damn, thank god he didn't kill us! Why do you think he left?                                 Dalia: He probably thought we weren't worth the effort and didn't want to waste any time on us.     Orion: Well, whatever it was, we're alive and the twins are not. I consider it half a victory.      Dalia: If you say so... My armor is broken, Jerry died and lost everything, and we didn't even get  the Gem of Doom. I'd call this a resounding failure.                                                Orion: Hey, I stood in front of Eternum's number one player. I'm sure that's not something you do   every day.                                                                                          Dalia: Yes, and that was fucking stupid! What if he had killed you?!                                Orion: You’re right... I can’t stand the thought of losing my precious loin cloth...                Dalia: I'm talking about me! I'd have lost all my items because of your stupidity!                  Orion: Come on, you can admit you enjoyed watching me. I won’t hold it against you.                 Dalia: What? I didn't.                                                                              Orion: You sure?                                                                                    Dalia: Yes, I'm sure. I mean... Yeah, ok, it was... brave. And I appreciate that you didn't want to leave me alone to die. But it was stupid.                                                           Orion: Stupid and brave.                                                                            Dalia: Bah. Anyway, let's get out of here. These wounds are getting pretty painful... Anyway, let's get out of here. These wounds are getting pretty painful... I just wanna sprawl out on my bed       already...                                                                                          Orion: Oh my deareth princess, when we’re back in the real world, do you also desire to be carried  into your bedchambers like this?                                                                    Dalia: Oh, s-shut the fuck up and just take me to the portal... silly.                              Orion: Damn... (Jesus fucking Christ. I don't even know what year I'm in. That was insane... I can  definitely see why people become so addicted to this game. And how am I so fucking tired? In the    real world, I've barely even moved a muscle... I should sleep now, we have school tomorrow. I can't believe that... That...) Zzzzzz... *Yawns* (Ahhh... Friday... Finally! It almost feels weird to come back to this world. I guess that's the good thing about Eternum. Whatever happens there, stays     there. There are no consequences in real life. But hey, honestly I can't complain about my real life so far. My first week in Kredon is almost finished!)                                               Dalia: Sleepy?                                                                                      Orion: Yeah, a bit. It’s not every day you can say you’ve faced a monster and the top Eternum       player.                                                                                             Dalia: *Giggles* Yeah, you got that right. You did good, though! Better than I expected. Sure we    lost the Gem of Doom, but... you proved your worth.                                                 Orion: Thanks Dalia, it means a lot coming from you.                                                Dalia: If only you were a bit stronger in real life...                                              Orion: *Laughs* Excuse me? Real life is my forte!                                                   Dalia: I'm not so sure about that... Maybe you should start training with me... Then you'd become a real warrior! Remember, your body in Eternum is the same body you have in real life, so gaining     strength here will translate to additional strength in the game.                                    Orion: Ahh... So that's why you exercise so much?                                                   Dalia: Well... it's one of the reasons. I'm going to the gym tomorrow. What do you say? You in?     Go with her                                                                                         Orion: Hmm... Sure, that sounds great. Count me in. I'll show you how to get a real workout in.     Dalia: *Laughs* Yeah, we'll see about that.                                                         Don't go                                                                                            Orion: Hmm... Nah... I told you, I don't need it. I'm strong enough.                                Dalia: Ok, ok... It's your loss.                                                                    Luna: Good morning, Orion.                                                                          Orion: Luna! What are you doing here?                                                               Luna: The computer class is optional, so groups A and B are merged here.                            Orion: Ah, that's nice!                                                                             Luna: How's your experience with Eternum going?                                                     Orion: It's incredible! It's better than I could have imagined.                                     Dalia: Hey there! Orion told me that he won a neural implant from your cafe’s contest! That was so  generous of you!                                                                                    Luna: Thank you... It was nothing.                                                                  Orion: Hey, we should play together someday!                                                        Luna: Sure, why not. What server do you wanna play in?                                              Orion: I'm the noob here, you tell me!                                                              Luna: Okay... Um... Yeah, there's one I'd like to try... Tonight?                                   Orion: Sure! I'll be there! (Ahhh... I love Kredon. I'm having so much fun here. Even though I'm on a tight schedule, I can’t complain about anything! I'm finally an Eternum player... I'll get to play with Luna tonight... Tomorrow I'll hit the gym with Dalia... I have a yoga class with Nancy... Then I'm going to Alex's house... A photoshoot with Penelope... Ahhh... Life's good, Orion!)            Professor Keating: Good morning, guys... Pardon the delay. P-Please, sit down. I have some bad      news...                                                                                             Orion: (Of course, Mr. Keating always has to ruin the day. What is it now? Another school project?) Professor Keating: It's about your friend Benjamin.                                                 Orion: *Laughs* (Oh, I thought there was bad news for us, not for that fucking rapist.) *Laughs* (I had almost forgotten about him.) *Laughs* (He must have called in sick this morning when he found   out he was banned from Eternum.)                                                                    Professor Keating: He... He passed away yesterday.                                                  Axel: What?! Do you think this is funny, old man?! What kind of fucking joke is this?! HUH?! Answer me! Where's Benja?!                                                                                 Professor Keating: I wish it was a joke, Axel. I'm so sorry, I know you two were very close.        Apparently, he was found dead in the garage of his house. He suffered a stroke when he was coming   back from exercising. The doctors say it happened because of stress and overexertion.               Classmate: Damn... I can't believe it... He looked so fit...                                        Classmate: Poor guy.                                                                                Professor Keating: The funeral is tomorrow morning, for anybody that wishes to go. I'm sure his     family will appreciate it. I'm... I'm sorry, guys.
