Orion: *Muttering* Ughhhh... F-Fuck, not this headache again...                                     The Founder: Is anything wrong, boy?                                                                Orion: N-No, I just got a bit d-dizzy for a second... Hmmm... (This damn pain came back at the worst possible time... Is this real? Is this man... really him?!)                                        The Founder: Four, Twelve, come here and get ready to leave. We must return as soon as we are done  with Mr. Richards here.                                                                             Praetorian: Yes, sir.                                                                               Orion: Y-You are... The Founder...                                                                  The Founder: That is my title, yes.                                                                 Orion: You... you're the creator of Eternum.                                                        The Founder: Hmm. I am. My life’s work.                                                             Orion: And... you know me? H-How? Why...?                                                           The Founder: When a Gem of Doom is first discovered by a player, Ulysses receives a notification. We always know who the first person to track down a Gem is. However, if a Gem transfers ownership for some reason... Ulysses is unable to know exactly who the new owner is. So, I know it was you who    found the Gem of Doom in The Red Herring. A player at level 2 getting one of my Gems. That is not   something you see everyday. Then, you somehow managed to access a restricted server and steal one of Idriel's creations... Calypso. You even killed two Praetorians in the process.                     Orion: W-What? Um... I-It’s not what it sounds like... (Idriel's creations? Not his?) We...         The Founder: I know you do not have that gem in your possession currently. I also know that buffoon, Garrington, lost his gem recently. So I guess that explains your presence at this dinner. Thieving from the casino is no simple feat. Astonishing.                                                     Orion: Um...                                                                                        The Founder: I am not easily impressed. I can count the players who’ve excited me since Eternum’s   founding on one hand. I am expecting great things from you, Orion.                                  Orion: Uh... thank you. (Fuck, I don't know what to say.)                                           The Founder: I have something for you. This is the Amulet of Blair. I have been selecting the most  promising players of Eternum and offering them this mighty artifact, in an attempt to accelerate the gathering of the 10 Gems. I want you to have it.                                                   Orion: (Accelerate? Why the rush? Is he in a hurry? Maybe he's dying...? Maybe that's why he created the 10 Gems quest, because he wanted to find a successor...) Uh... what does this amulet do?       The Founder: The Amulet of Blair has one simple, passive effect... but it is a powerful one. With   it, you can become... immortal. You cannot die in Eternum if you have this amulet in your inventory. No matter what happens to your body, you will be able to re-enter the game through the nearest Exit Portal. You will be completely healed, with your inventory intact. That is... my gift.             Orion: (Becoming immortal...?)                                                                      Take the amulet                                                                                     Orion: It's an offer that's difficult to refuse. I’ll gladly accept it. Thank you.                  Refuse                                                                                              Orion: Um... I appreciate the offer, but... it... feels like cheating. I prefer to play under the   same conditions as everyone else.                                                                   The Founder: You won't regret it, Orion. I hope you can go even further with it. Huh... Very well,  as you wish. The others also refused. Interesting. I wonder if I should feel disappointed or...     proud.                                                                                              Orion: (The others? How many players did he talk to? Thanatos has to be one...)                     The Founder: Anyway... I hope you can continue your path even without this artifact, Orion.         Orion: I hope so too.                                                                               The Founder: It was a pleasure finally meeting you, but I am afraid I must leave now. As you can    understand, my position requires constant meetings and appointments.                                Orion: Of course, I can only imagine.                                                               The Founder: Before I leave, though... I have one last question for you. And please, be honest. On  all these adventures in Eternum... battling monsters, solving mysteries, embarking on quests... do  you fight for yourself? Or do you fight for others?                                                 Orion: What? Me? I... don’t know. Neither, I guess.                                                 The Founder: But if you had to choose one or the other... which choice describes your... ideology?  Orion: Um...                                                                                        I fight to protect others                                                                           Orion: I fight to protect others.                                                                   The Founder: Hmm.                                                                                   I fight for myself                                                                                  Orion: I fight for myself.                                                                          The Founder: Hmm. So tell me... Would you sacrifice the innocent to save those whom you love?       Yes                                                                                                 Orion: What? To save the people I love? Um... I... I guess.                                         The Founder: And is that what a hero would do? Sacrificing the lives of the innocent? At that point, can you truly claim you’re protecting others?                                                      Orion: Uh...                                                                                        No                                                                                                  Orion: Never.                                                                                       The Founder: So you'd let your loved ones die in exchange for the lives of strangers? You’d let     young Miss Bardot die to save someone you’d never even met?                                         Orion: What? Uh... well... I wouldn't...                                                            The Founder: Would you sacrifice those you care about for the chance to gain more power?            Yes                                                                                                 Orion: Um... Honestly? I think so, yeah.                                                            The Founder: Hmm. Interesting. Very interesting.                                                    No                                                                                                  Orion: Sacrifice? Well... no, not really.                                                           The Founder: Hmm... then perhaps you do fight for others, after all...?                             Orion: Uh... Well...                                                                                The Founder: . . . I am sorry, these are just the ramblings of an old man.                          Orion: Um... no worries, it's okay.                                                                 The Founder: Good night, Orion.                                                                     Orion: G-Good night, sir. (Holy fuck. No one on the executive board of Ulysses has ever talked      face-to-face with this man, and yet... I just did. I don't know if I should feel honored... or      scared.)                                                                                            Alex: Finally!                                                                                      Orion: *Turning around* Alex! Thank god you found me!                                               Alex: Yeah, well, it wasn't easy. Your directions sucked.                                           Orion: I know! I was about to tell you more, but then something happened, and... shit, you're not   gonna believe it. I met the Founder!                                                                Alex: The Founder? Really?                                                                          Orion: Yeah! And right after we were beginning to think he was a fake!                              Alex: Mm-hm, yeah, sure. And then you shared a pizza with him, Thanatos and Idriel, right?          Orion: I'm serious! I was talking to him! He left less than a minute ago!                           Alex: How convenient.                                                                               Orion: You have to believe me!                                                                      Alex: Hmm... You met the Founder. Alone. In a dirty basement with no lights.                        Orion: I know it sounds weird, but trust me! And we weren’t completely alone, there were Praetorians there too! I wouldn't lie to you about something like this! Give me 5 minutes to explain           everything.                                                                                         Alex: I’ve gotta stop you right there. My father is giving a speech in the main hall, and I think   some of the shareholders are starting to get suspicious of all our questions. I already told Calypso to leave, she's waiting for us outside.                                                            Orion: Really? Dammit. (I was supposed to meet that strange man at 12, but if we have to leave... I guess I won't be able to. Anyways, I doubt it was anything important. My head’s full of enough info as it is. I’m having a tough time remembering everything.) Alright, why don’t you log off and head  over to my house, then? I’ll tell you everything in-person.                                         Alex: I can't. I have to wake up early tomorrow. I have swimming training at 8.                     Orion: Oh... fair enough. Well, I'll update the others with everything we learned tonight. I can    tell you everything on Monday, after school. Fancy a coffee?                                        Alex: . . . *Snorts* Smooth.                                                                        Orion: What?                                                                                        Alex: Nothing, nothing. Sure, you can tell me everything while buying me some coffee. We’ve gotta   prepare a plan. We’ll need someone who is a master at strategy.                                     Orion: Exactly. And I think I’ve got the perfect person in mind.                                    Alex: I guess we should leave before Calypso starts disintegrating people.                          Orion: *Laughs* True.                                                                               Alex: No thanks. You can tell me on Monday at school.                                               Orion: Hmm... Okay, let's do that. In the meantime, I'll update the others with everything we       learned tonight.                                                                                    Alex: Alright, can we leave now?                                                                    Orion: I'll follow you!                                                                             Alex: *Yawns* What was I saying? Ah, yeah. *Playing with her cross* Mr. Kellegan said I'm ready for the Olympic qualifiers, but... meh, I don't know. You know I love swimming, Baba, but... I'd have to travel across the country, and... ugh. Maybe next year. I have other stuff to do now. I have to    graduate and get into college. And Eternum is a priority now. It's not just a hobby anymore, you    know? I met this guy. He's... a total headache. He's always in some kind of trouble. Which is       exhausting, but also... entertaining. In a way. He didn't even know I was a Bardot, can you believe it? Well, he didn't even know who the Bardots were! Apparently he just heard of them a week before  we met. *Laughs* He fought both Axel and Dad in less than a week! He's a mess. But also... kinda    sweet. I mean... He's funny. He makes me laugh. Well, not always. Sometimes. I... I don't know, I   like spending time with him. He... He makes me feel like everything will be alright. When I'm with  him... I feel reassured and calm. It's like... He and his friends are always in some kind of        trouble. Which is exhausting, but also... entertaining. In a way. *Dropping the cross* Do you       remember what you told me that day at the beach? When we went fishing? Could it be possible that... Dalia: At the beach? Mmmm... I don't remember going fishing with you. Do you mean volleyball? I do  remember doing that last summer.                                                                    Alex: . . . D-Didn't your mom ever tell you it was rude to eavesdrop?!                              Dalia: *Giggles* Two people need to be present for a conversation, you know? Who the hell were you  talking to?                                                                                         Alex: I was talking to myself!                                                                      Dalia: Oh, and were you winning the argument?                                                       Alex: SHUT UP!                                                                                      Dalia: *Giggles* I'm kidding, I'm kidding! *Jumping over the bench* Make room! But seriously, if you wanna talk about something, I can lend an ear.                                                     Alex: It's nothing. I was just mentally reviewing some errands. Why are you even here?              Dalia: I just went for a run, since it’s not raining for the first time in forever. I spotted you on this bench and thought I’d say hi.                                                                 Alex: Well, you can continue your run, then. Thank you for stopping by.                             Dalia: Come on! Don't be so closed off! I know something has been bothering you. I feel like I’ve   seen you deep in thought all week.                                                                  Alex: I said I'm okay! And... like you're one to talk! You still haven't told me what happened in   that private server of yours!                                                                       Dalia: W-What? Nothing happened!                                                                    Alex: Nothing, my ass! You came to me all nervous wanting to tell me something, and then you didn't!Dalia: Because there was nothing to tell!                                                           Alex: You're blushing, babe... Come on, you're dying to tell me. Spit it out already. You were there with a guy, right?                                                                                 Dalia: Um... Well, yeah, but...                                                                     Alex: But what? What happened? I want the full truth, warts and all.                                Dalia: Uhh... okay, alright, alright. I invited a guy there. Kind of. We talked for a bit, and... I don't know. The sea, the sunset, the mood, everything was hitting the right spot. We were playing   around, and... I'm not sure how it happened, but before I knew it, I was taking my clothes off for  him.                                                                                                Alex: No way! And then what happened?! Did he get naked too?                                        Dalia: Uhh... yeah. Then I... I g-gave him a blowjob, and...                                        Alex: Holy shit! And how did that go?                                                               Dalia: It went well... I think. It was kinda fun. More fun than I thought, at least.                Alex: Hah! That sounds like you, alright. I expected no less from my gluttonous friend. You're only happy when you have something in your mouth!                                                        Dalia: Hey, don't overdo it!                                                                        Alex: Overdo it? Come on, Dalia. If anything, I'm understating your love for meat in your mouth.    You're getting ready to chow down on a huge hot dog right now!                                      Dalia: It's 6:30 PM! I need my fourth meal of the day! I can't skip it, I didn't have my second     breakfast this morning.                                                                             Alex: Aren't you going to run? You could have waited till you got home.                             Dalia: Well, I saw this food cart passing by and I thought I’d make a one-time exception. No biggie, just a coincidence.                                                                                Hot dog vendor: Goodbye, Dalia!                                                                     Dalia: Bye, Roy! Say hello to Paula!                                                                Alex: YOU EVEN KNOW THE VENDOR'S NAME!                                                              Dalia: *Gobbling the whole hot dog in one bite* Hey, I mmdidn't come here to be judged. If myou     wanted a hot dog, you could have said so.                                                           Alex: Yeah, you're right, we should get back on topic... You were telling me a very interesting     story.                                                                                              Dalia: Oh... well, the story is pretty much finished. There's not much else to tell.                Alex: Really? What happened after you blew him?                                                     Dalia: Well, he... came.                                                                            Alex: You swallowed it?                                                                             Dalia: W-What? O-Of course not...                                                                   Alex: Well, and what happened then?                                                                 Dalia: What do you mean? We stood up and left the server. That's it.                                Alex: Whaaaat? And he didn't even return the favor?                                                 Dalia: R-Return the favor?                                                                          Alex: Of course! He should have gone down on you! Favor for a favor. Tit for tat... or twat, I      guess.                                                                                              Dalia: W-What? Do you think that... Should he?                                                      Alex: Absolutely. You should DEMAND it! Because... you like him, right? That's what you want, don't you?                                                                                                Dalia: Um... I mean... I don't know... maybe... yeah, maybe he should. Like... dick for twat.       Alex: You got this. Just make sure not to tell him you enjoyed giving him head. So he puts in extra effort.                                                                                             Dalia: Yeah... thanks for the advice. I'll... I'll think about it. (God, that would... I mean, do I really want him to do that? It would be... fair. Right? Yeah, that would be fair. Just so we're     even. And then we can move on... Just one more time. Hmm. Yeah. That sounds right.)                 Alex: I know nothing about your life! You could tell me what's going on between you and Jerry!      Dalia: W-What?! Nothing is going on! We're just friends!                                            Alex: I don't know... I see you playing together a lot lately.                                      Dalia: Because he's a friend. And a good Eternum player. That's all!                                Alex: Okay, okay... If you say so... I won't insist.                                                Dalia: (Jerry? Jesus, no. I don't even like him. The only guy I kinda liked lately wasn’t even into me. Which was for the better, though. I can't believe I had a crush on that idiot. Thank god that's over now.)                                                                                          Penelope: Hi sis!                                                                                   Dalia: Hmm? Penny! What are you doing here?                                                         Penelope: I'm meeting Mom at The Roof, and this park was on the way. I had some time to kill, and I like to come here to get ideas. It's a good photo spot!                                             Dalia: Oh, that’s true, definitely see its potential.                                               Alex: You look good, Penelope. I like those high-waisted shorts.                                    Penelope: Oh, thank you, Alex! I just picked the first thing I saw in my closet. Nothing too        special. Hale Bob shorts from the Fall collection and a Max&Co shirt. Annie recommended that shop to me!                                                                                                Alex: Looks good!                                                                                   Penelope: Oh, and now that I'm with you... I wanted to ask you something, I hope you don't mind.    Alex: Hey, we've robbed a casino together. That's what brings people together. We’re partners in    crime now. Ask whatever you want.                                                                   Penelope: *Laughs* True that! It's about your tattoos. I've never gotten one, but it's something    I've always been curious about. Any advice?                                                         Alex: Well, if it's your first tattoo, I'd recommend you get a small one. And maybe in a place that could easily be hidden, especially since you’re a model. Do you have something in mind?             Penelope: I fell in love with the minimalist design of a flamingo I saw the other day on Pinterest! And I thought of the wrist or maybe the ankle for the location. What do you think?                  Alex: Those are both good options. Do you have a pic of the tattoo you saw?                         Penelope: Sure! Give me a second.                                                                   Dalia: . . . Um... Where did you say you were going...?                                             Penelope: To The Roof, that pub with a terrace. It’s near the library.                              Dalia: With Mom...?                                                                                 Penelope: Yeah... with Mom. Why the interrogating tone?                                             Dalia: What tone? This is how I always talk.                                                        Penelope: No... not really, no. You’re kinda grilling me, to be honest.                             Alex: *Conciliatory tone* Um... You know, now that you both are wearing ponytails, I can see how    much you look alike! Right?                                                                         Dalia: I was just curious because your outfit is quite revealing for “just a meet-up with Mom.”     Penelope: You mean this little bit of cleavage...? You've been very prudish lately, sis.            Dalia: LITTLE bit of cleavage?! That's not a LITTLE bit of cleavage! Back me up here, Alex!         Alex: Well, I don't want to get involved... but y-yeah, I guess it's pretty... suggestive.          Penelope: I... um... it's just... I-It’s a cute outfit, like Alex just said! I like to dress well,  no matter the occasion. And besides, there'll be more people there, so it's not “just a meet-up with Mom.”                                                                                              Dalia: Oh, really? Who else is gonna be there? If I may be so bold as to ask.                       Penelope: Annie. And Nova. And...                                                                   Dalia: And?                                                                                         Penelope: And I think Orion mentioned he was going to pass by, too.                                 Dalia: Oh... Interesting.                                                                           Penelope: Interesting how?                                                                          Dalia: No, it’s nothing. Just interesting.                                                          Penelope: Okay... *Clears throat* Well, I should get going.                                         Dalia: You know what? I think I'll go with you.                                                     Alex: No running, then?                                                                             Dalia: Nah... I'm pretty tired today. I think I’ll grab coffee and a snack and take it easy today.  You don't mind, do you?                                                                             Penelope: *Fake giggle* Of course not, Dal! The more the merrier!                                   Dalia: *Fake chuckle* That's what I always say!                                                     Alex: Uh... Well, I'll get going too. I'll see you later.                                           Penelope: Goodbye, Alex!                                                                            Dalia: Bye Alex! Let's go, sissy!                                                                   Penelope: I'm sure Mom will be happy to see you there... So... I wanted to ask about your tattoos...Orion: *Sneezes* Ah.... Aaahh... *Sneezes* Choo! Aghh... Jesus! Man, tell me I didn't catch a cold, please. Not when the weekend is around the corner...                                                Chang: My mother always says that when you sneeze, it means that someone elsewhere is talking about you.                                                                                                Orion: Ah, I like that! Who do you think might be talking about me?                                 Chang: It could be a girl from school who has a crush on you!                                       Orion: Hah! You think so?                                                                           Chang: Yeah! Or... maybe it's Axel discussing with his hitmen about the best way to make you        disappear without a trace.                                                                          Orion: Um... yeah, thanks, Chang. I preferred the first hypothesis. Now that you mention Axel,      though... I haven't seen him since the dinner at the Boyle Mansion. He hasn't come to class since   then. I wonder why.                                                                                 Chang: Maybe he's waiting for you to get complacent so his contract killers can catch you off guard.Orion: STOP.                                                                                        Nancy: Maybe he's waiting for you in Eternum, so he can murder you in the game and in the real world at the same time, like what possibly happened to Benjamin.                                         Chang: Oh, that is very likely, actually, Ms. Carter. It would be poetic and, at the same time, easy to make it look like an accident.                                                                  Orion: C-Can you two stop already?! Let me enjoy the afternoon in peace! How's that spreadsheet     going, by the way?                                                                                  Nancy: I'm almost done! I just need to update this formula here... adjust the reference here...     and... All done! *Taking off her glasses* Alright, guys! I have a plan for every one of you. You're gonna love it. Nothing like an Excel spreadsheet to keep things organized! As soon as Annie arrives, we can start. Is everyone ready?                                                                   Orion: Ready! I knew it was a good idea to put you in charge of strategy.                           Chang: I was born ready!                                                                            Nova: *Muttering* Goddammit... Agggh! Why can't I draw hands?! WHY?! *Muttering* I think I'm making them too small. They look like baby hands on an adult body.                                         Orion: Nova?                                                                                        Nova: Y-Yeah, yeah, sorry! Give me a minute. I just have to finish this little thing...             Orion: Can we finally see what the hell you’ve been drawing? Every single time I've seen you this   week, you've had a pencil in your hands.                                                            Nova: Not yet! It's a surprise! No one can... Ugh, I gotta piss so bad!                             Orion: Oh, come on, go to the bathroom! This new artistic side of yours has absorbed you!           Nova: Ugh... *Stands up* O-Okay, okay! I'm going to the toilet. But I'll be back in 30 seconds! No, 20! N-No one take a look at my... drawing! Especially not Orion!                                    Orion: Why not, though?                                                                             Nova: Because it's unfinished! You'd make fun of me.                                                Orion: That's not true!                                                                             Nova: I don't care! Promise me you won't look!                                                      Orion: Okay, okay, I promise.                                                                       Nova: *Running away* Thanks!                                                                        Orion: *Chuckles* (What's with all the mystery? I guess she just got obsessed with something new. It happened when she got a smartphone for the first time, too. I can't help but be intrigued,         though...)                                                                                          Look at the drawing                                                                                 Orion: (A small look can't hurt.) Hmm... (What's this?)                                             Nancy: Orion! She asked you not to look!                                                            Orion: It's just a little peek! She won't mind... (Oh, she's drawing a manga comic! And damn, it    doesn't look half bad! Though those hands are on the small side...) Hmm?                            Nova: . . .                                                                                         Orion: Oh... Um... Y-You were quick!                                                                She snatches the sketchpad right out of your hands.                                                 Orion: This isn’t what it looks like. There was a bug on the sketchpad and–                         Nova: You promised me you wouldn't look!                                                            Orion: I-I know, but you were acting weird, and... A-And I don't know why! That looks awesome! Are  you starting a manga comic?                                                                         Nova: I... It's a... Bah! Forget it. It just was a ridiculous, dumb thing.                          Orion: Nova! Don–                                                                                   Nova: No. I shouldn't even have started it in the first place. It was a stupid idea.                Orion: (Damn... I shouldn't have looked.)                                                           Nancy: Are you okay, Nova?                                                                          Nova: Yeah, I’m fine! Thanks for asking, ma'am. I was just being... dumb.                           Orion: (I feel bad now.)                                                                            Nova: Anyway, I'm ready! We can start now.                                                          Don't look                                                                                          Orion: (But I shouldn't look. Whatever it is, it seemed important to her. She hasn't hacked me since she promised not to. It'd be wrong to break my promise and betray her trust after that.) While Nova is...                                                                                              Nova: *Taking a big jump* I'M BACK!                                                                 Orion: W-What? That wasn't even 20 seconds!                                                         Nova: No one looked at my drawing, right?                                                           Orion: Nooo, don't worry.                                                                           Nova: Sure?                                                                                         Orion: Hey, I promised not to look. I’d never break a promise.                                      Nova: Excellent! Then I’ll promise to show it to you when it's finished.                            Orion: *Chuckles* Alright, I'll be waiting.                                                         Nova: I'm ready, ma'am! Ready, ma'am!                                                               Annie: Hi guys!                                                                                     Nancy: Ah! The person we’ve been waiting for!                                                       Annie: Sorry for the wait!                                                                          Nancy: No worries! We just got here.                                                                Nova: Hi Annie! D-Did you see yesterday's episode?                                                  Annie: Of Aeternitas?! You bet I did!                                                               Orion: Ah, is that the new anime series based on the Universe of Eternum? I haven't started it yet. Nova: You'd better start soon then, because it's freaking AWESOME! Did you see the scene in         Andromeda? With the spaceships?                                                                     Annie: Oh my god, that was so AMAZING! Eliza is the best!                                           Nova: Right?! Eliza is the best character ever created! When she went to the–                       Orion: No spoilers!                                                                                 Nancy: You're so cute together, girls. I didn't know you two got along so well.                     Annie: It's exciting to meet someone who watches as much television as me!                          Nova: I'm sorry if I get too excited, it's just that... well, I never had a group of friends like   this before, and... Having someone to talk to about these kinds of things feels kinda new to me.    Nancy: No need to apologize for anything, Nova. I've gotta say that I have a similar feeling when it comes to all of you. The scholarship that was granted to Orion and his best friends is the best    thing that has happened to me in a very long time.                                                  Chang: *Clears throat* I think it's best not to dig too deep into the "best friend" subject. Last   time, feelings were hurt.                                                                           Annie: *Laughs* Are you saying that for me? No worries Chang, I'll concede that honor to you. I     don't really care about the "best friend" status anymore, now that Orion and I are... Um...         Nancy: . . .                                                                                        Annie: Are... Um... N-Now that we are SUPER best friends! I-It's a rank above! Y-Yeah! Super-duper  best friends! Wait... did Orion say Chang is his best friend?! And not me?!                         Orion: I didn–                                                                                      Annie: Oh, how could you?! Grrr... I'm so mad at you! You're hopeless! I'm so pissed off at you.    Grr!                                                                                                Orion: (Annie pretending to be angry is possibly the most adorable thing I've ever seen.) *Clears   throat* Soooo, now that we're all ready... What's the plan, Nancy?                                  Annie: *Laughs* No worries Chang, I'll concede that honor to you. I don't really mind anymore. I'm  happy being just a good friend.                                                                     Orion: (Yeah... I guess she's right.) Alright, so now that we're all ready... What's the plan,      Nancy?                                                                                              Nancy: Ah, yes! I tried to cover everything, so let me know if I'm missing anything. To summarize, a quick overview of all the open fronts we have... first, the Founder. The man everyone knows of, but nobody knows a thing about. We have no idea where he is, or how to find him, but he's the center of this whole ruckus. Even a tiny clue about his life in the real world would be helpful. We need to  find out if there are any limits to his knowledge about Eternum, and his power in the servers. Next, we have... the Syndicate. According to what you and Alex discovered at the party, it seems to be a group of people acting against Ulysses in some way. And they seem to be trying to help the players  get the Gems of Doom... for some reason. Which brings us to the next point. Whether there really is a conspiracy behind all of this, or whether our minds are just wandering, there's one thing we need to do for sure: Find the remaining Gems of Doom! Obtaining influence, meeting powerful people,      getting stronger... and maybe rich! Everything revolves around them. We have one, but we need 9     more! So I'd say that our best bet is finding the third Weapon of Atlas. Dione and our lovely elven princess have proven to be powerful assets, so if we can find the sword, we'd be unstoppable! Either that, or... we’d need to locate another player with a Gem of Doom. And... we know one who has 5    Gems in his possession. If we can find Thanatos somehow... and take his Gems... we'll be halfway    there! I think it'll be best if each one of us attacks a different front. We can cover more ground. Orion: I have a pretty busy weekend, though. I'm going with Luna and her father to the Day of the   Dead celebration tonight, and tomorrow we have that costume party on the campus. I'm going with Luna and her father to the Day of the Dead celebration, and... Tomorrow we have that costume party on   the campus, and...                                                                                  Nancy: No worries! I have it all under control. I didn't conquer the Peloponnese in less than a week by misemploying my men. Let's see... First of all, Alex will try to find info about Ulysses or the Founder through her father and his belongings. I already asked her if she was comfortable with it,  and she loved the idea. That's a thread that needs to be pulled! Next, Penelope and Dalia will go to the Agora server and ask around to try to get some info about the Syndicate. I feel like they’ve   been at each other’s throats recently, so teaming up might do them some good. Annie, could you and  Luna go to the Plains of Denaria tomorrow evening? My men heard rumors about a Gem of Doom hidden in that server. I think it's worth checking out.                                                      Annie: Absolutely! I’m really familiar with that server! We won’t fail you, Nancy! No stone will be left unturned!                                                                                      Nancy: Sweet! And for the last mission... I'm gonna need you on Sunday morning, Orion. Would that be possible?                                                                                          Orion: Sure! Sunday morning should be good. What's the plan?                                        Nancy: We're gonna go to my office. I think we can get some useful info, now that my company is     working with Ulysses. But don't worry too much about it for now, I'll explain the details when we   get closer to it. Which brings us to the device we talked about over the phone, Nova. You know, the one that can steal the inventory of an Eternum player? Could you look into it? I mean, I guess that was probably just a Hollywood fantasy, and no one is really capable of doing that. And definitely   not on such short notice.                                                                           Nova: Maybe a newbie hacker couldn't do it, but lucky for you, I know the best one in the country!  I'm already working on it, and it should be able to steal the inventory of any player when they log into Eternum. I just need to figure out how to link the device to an Eternum Visor. *Giggles* Don't worry, guys, I'll create the best hacking device your eyes have ever seen! I guarantee it!          Nancy: Excellent! We should do a catch-up next week with everything we've discovered!               Orion: Sounds good!                                                                                 Chang: Oh boy, I can't wait to hear the mission that I have been assigned!                          Nancy: Oh... *Awkward chuckle* W-Well, you don't play Eternum, so I didn't really prepare           anything...                                                                                         Chang: O-Oh... Oh.                                                                                  Nancy: I-I'm sorry! I didn't think that...                                                          Chang: It's okay, ma'am. There comes a day in the life of every man and woman when the sun stops    shining. We must accept it. We came to suffer. For what is expectation but a kind of folly, and what is that folly but an excess of hope?                                                               Orion: Erm...                                                                                       Chang: All I ask? For this pain to seem purposeful.                                                 Give a mission to Chang                                                                             Orion: Um... D-Don't be sad, Chang! I have a mission for you! Something vital! You've gotta go to   the mall and buy us... Uh... M-Matching T-shirts! You can even choose the design! Every             self-respecting team should have matching T-shirts! What do you say?!                               Chang: . . . I'll get you the best matching T-shirts you've ever seen, guys! Don't worry, I won't   fail you!                                                                                           Orion: I'm sure you won't! *Chuckles* (It's easy to make him happy.)                                Don't give him any task                                                                             Orion: Um... Come on, Chang! Don't be sad! Next week, we'll go for an all day marathon of heist     movies! How’s that sound? What do you say?                                                          Chang: . . . Extended versions? With director’s commentary?                                         Orion: Of course!                                                                                   Chang: . . . You've got yourself a deal, my friend! I'll start selecting the movies!                Orion: *Chuckles* It's easy to make you happy.                                                      Nancy: *Standing up* Alright then, everything is settled! I should get going now, I'm supposed to   meet Penelope by the entrance.                                                                      Annie: I'll stay for a bit, I just ordered a tea.                                                   Nova: Yeah, I'll stay too! I want to continue my drawing.                                           Nancy: No problem at all! I'll see you later. Actually, can you pay for my latte, Orion? I left my  wallet at home, but I'll pay you back later, I promise.                                             Orion: Of course Nancy, and please, there's no need to pay me back.                                 Nancy: Aw, thank you sweetheart.                                                                    Orion: Yeah, I'll be on my way as well. I don't want Mr. Hernandez to get angry because I'm late.   Goodbye, girls! Bye, Chang!                                                                         Annie: B-Bye, Orion! I'll see you at home! Bye!                                                     Nova: Bye Orion! Don't forget about tomorrow's party!                                               Orion: I won't!                                                                                     Nova: See ya!                                                                                       Orion: Hi! Can you ring me up?                                                                      Clerk: One moment, please! I'll be right with you!                                                  Orion: Of course, no problem.                                                                       Nancy: I think the door of the bathroom is jammed. Could you help me with it, Orion? I've gotta go  before leaving.                                                                                     Orion: Sure, let me check.                                                                          Nancy: Thank you.                                                                                   Orion: Although... maybe they locked it. We should ask the clerk. Excuse me, is th– W-What?! What is going on?                                                                                          Nancy: I’ll be honest, those spreadsheets turned me on...                                           Orion: Um...                                                                                        Nancy: It's been quite a challenge trying to find you alone this past week, Orion... Every time     we've gotten some time for ourselves, we've been interrupted. Annie, Penelope, Dalia, a call from   work, or... a fucking war.                                                                          Orion: Y-Yeah, that was something else.                                                             Nancy: When are we going to continue where we left off, Orion...?                                   Orion: (Oh boy...)                                                                                  Nancy: I've been thinking about it since then...                                                    Orion: Well, we should find a day in Eternum to–                                                    Nancy: Fuck Eternum. We keep saying how there's literally no difference between Eternum and the     "real" world, so... why should I care? The people are the same, the consequences are the same, and  surely... *whispering* the sensations are the same... if not better...                              Orion: *Gulps* I guess you're right.                                                                Nancy: I'm not one of those young girls you hang out with, Orion, so... let's stop playing games and speak clearly, shall we? I want you to fuck me, Orion. Hard. And filthy.                           Orion: You naughty... You're really turning me on right now, Nancy...                               Nancy: And I want you to fuck me NOW.                                                               Orion: W-What? Now?                                                                                 Nancy: Now. Inside this restroom. With dozens of people right outside. *Giggles* I think I've never felt so horny. Not even when I was a teenager. I can’t wait anymore... I feel like I'm gonna explode if I have to wait one more minute.                                                                 Orion: (Oh god, this is happening!) We're gonna have to be really quick...                          Nancy: Oh, don't worry, with what I'm planning to do to you... I don't think you’ll last too long.  And this time, I won't let any–                                                                     Penelope: Hi! Have you seen my mother? Tall, green eyes, similar body to mine, redhead?             Dalia: She's 39 but looks 10 years younger.                                                         Nancy: (This can't be happening again...)                                                           Clerk: Yeah! She went to the bathroom.                                                              Nancy: F-Fuck! Hide!                                                                                Penelope: Ah! There you are!                                                                        Nancy: Penny!                                                                                       Penelope: Are you ready to go shopping?                                                             Nancy: S-Sure! I was about to get out and wait for you.                                             Dalia: Hi Mom!                                                                                      Nancy: Hi sweetie! I thought you were going for a run.                                              Dalia: Yeah, but I ran into my beloved sis at the park, and I knew I couldn't miss a chance to go to the mall!                                                                                          Nancy: I'm so happy to hear that. L-Let's go!                                                       Penelope: So... did Orion leave already?                                                            Nancy: Yep! Just a minute ago.                                                                      Penelope: Aw... that's too bad.                                                                     Dalia: Maybe if someone could run faster...                                                         Penelope: I'm wearing boots with heels!                                                             You hear their voices fade away as they leave the place.                                            Orion: I can't believe this happened... AGAIN! (Every time Nancy is in the mood and something       between us is about to happen, I get cockblocked by something or someone! What have I done to       deserve this? What god have I pissed off?!) *Sighs* (Anyway, I guess I should get going. I don't    want Mr. Hernandez to get angry because I'm late. Anyway, I guess I should get going. I don't wanna stay here all day. ...As soon as my erection passes. Alright... Spruce and Alder. Luna's Dad is     supposed to pick me up here. I have to remember to... Aww... FUCK. I forgot the wine I bought to    give to Mr. Hernandez as a thank you for inviting me. I'm a fucking mess. I’ll look so rude showing up with nothing to offer.)                                                                          You hear some music in the distance, as a car roars down the street at full throttle.               Orion: (Is that him?)                                                                               Mr. Hernandez: I LOVE PUNCTUAL PEOPLE! *Taking a deep breath*                                       Orion: *Chuckles* (Of course it’s Mr. H.)                                                           Mr. Hernandez: *Exhaling* Ahh! Isn't it a lovely day to celebrate the Day of the Dead?              Orion: *Chuckles* Well, I'm not so sure. I saw that it’s supposed to rain all afternoon.            Mr. Hernandez: EXACTLY! There’s nothing more appropriate!                                           Orion: Well, you have a point there! *Reaching out* It's a pleasure to see you again, Mr. Hernandez.Mr. Hernandez: Come give me a hug, Orion! And no need for formalities. You can just call me Victor! Orion: S-Sure! Thank you, Victor.                                                                   Mr. Hernandez: Thank YOU for joining us today, Orion. Luna and I are so glad you were able to join  us!                                                                                                 Orion: The pleasure is all mine, seriously. I bought some wine, but...                              Mr. Hernandez: Forget all about that! *Sobbing* You remind me of the son I lost after he fell ill   with smallpox. I see shadows of him in everything you do... *Sobbing* Even now, you're almost       bringing a tear to my eye...                                                                        Luna: You've never had a son, Dad. And smallpox was eradicated decades ago.                         Mr. Hernandez: Hey! It's just an old Mexican saying! You're losing your roots, Luna!                Luna: Hi Orion.                                                                                     Orion: Luna! I feel like I haven’t talked to you in forever!                                        Luna: We saw each other yesterday in school. In psychology class.                                   Orion: Oh... true. Well, I missed you anyway! (I really did, though. Luna's sweet voice always makes me feel peaceful.)                                                                                 Luna: It’s good to see you too!                                                                     Mr. Hernandez: Alright, alright, alright! Are you ready to try the best tacos you've ever eaten,    Orion?                                                                                              Orion: I can't wait!                                                                                Mr. Hernandez: It'll be the best Day of the Dead lunch you've ever had, I guarantee.                Orion: *Chuckles* Well, I haven't had many of those. And it's 7:40 PM already, so... I'd say it's   more of a dinner, actually!                                                                         Mr. Hernandez: Oh no, it's a lunch. We're going to my brother's house.                              Orion: Mmm... I'm not sure if I’m understanding. Why is it a lunch...?                              Mr. Hernandez: My brother lives in another state, 650 miles away.                                   Luna: We always gather together there to celebrate the Day of the Dead. It's a tradition. My        grandmother came up from Mexico too.                                                                Mr. Hernandez: It's a 10-hour drive, so we should be there by 7 AM. You can spend the morning at the pool while I cook.                                                                                 Orion: Wait... WHAT?! A 10-hour drive?! I-I thought it was today! I can't tomorrow!                 Mr. Hernandez: Oh, really? I figured you already knew it was far away. I thought I told you that    already. I'm sorry...                                                                               Orion: I mean... I already told Penelope and Nova that I'd be going with them to a costume party at the University tomorrow night, so... I already told Penelope that I'd be going with her to a costume party at the University tomorrow night, so...                                                      Mr. Hernandez: Oh... at night, you said? Then there's no problem! Luna will stay until Monday, but I need to come back sooner since I can't keep the cafe closed for so many days. I can drive you!     We’ll just have to leave after eating.                                                              Orion: Oh, really? You don't mind? And will we make it back in time?                                Mr. Hernandez: For sure. I know the road, I can make it a 7-hour drive. Or less, if the weather's   good.                                                                                               Orion: Um... (T-That sounds dangerous.)                                                             Get in the car                                                                                      Orion: Well, in that case... Alright, let's do it!                                                  Don't risk tomorrow's party                                                                         Orion: I appreciate the offer, but I don’t want to risk it. And I don't want to risk a car accident or getting a ticket or something for driving too quickly.                                           Mr. Hernandez: Oh... are you sure? Don't worry about the risk, Orion, I’ve done the trip plenty of  times, we’d almost definitely get back in time.                                                     Orion: No worries, it's okay, Victor. And I'm so sorry, I really wanted to go. Maybe next year!     Mr. Hernandez: Yeah... I guess we always have next year. Well, it is what it is. Take care, son.    Let's go, Luna, we've gotta go.                                                                     Luna: Sorry the college party clashes with the Day of the Dead celebration, Orion. I know you really wanted to hang out with everyone at the University. I didn't realize the party would be on the same day. I'm sorry about it.                                                                           Orion: Hey, it's no one's fault! It was just a misunderstanding.                                    Luna: Yeah... But it's okay. Thank you anyway, Orion. I'll see you at school.                       Orion: Bye! Have fun!                                                                               Luna: Goodbye.                                                                                      Orion: (Damn... That was cold. It kinda broke my heart to flake on her like that. But I can’t miss  that party! All those older college chicks... the University of Kredon better get ready for me!     Anyways... I guess my plans for today are just Netflix and Eternum. And I guess I could look into   making last minute adjustments for my costume tomorrow, too. Could be worse!) Well, now that I think about it, I don't really have any plans until Sunday morning... We would definitely be back        tomorrow?                                                                                           Mr. Hernandez: Yes! Luna will stay until Monday, but I need to come back sooner since I can't keep  the cafe closed for so many days. I can drive you! We’ll just have to leave after eating.           Orion: Well, in that case... alright, let's do it!                                                  Mr. Hernandez: EXCELLENT! Everyone, to the car! Don't worry Orion, time will fly by. Moreover,      Fiero's seats are super comfortable. You'll be able to sleep better than in your own bed.           Orion: Fiero?                                                                                       Mr. Hernandez: This beautiful car! He's older than Luna, and he’s never let me down.                Luna: My dad takes very good care of this Jeep. Fiero doesn't have a scratch. He even tried         convincing me Fiero was my older brother when I was younger.                                        Mr. Hernandez: Of course. He's like the son I lost after he–                                        Luna: Dad!                                                                                          Mr. Hernandez: *Clears throat* But enough talking, hop in!                                          Luna: You can sit in the front seat. The seat’s more comfortable.                                   Orion: Don't worry about me! I'm the guest, I'll sit in the back.                                   Luna: Seriously, I insist. I prefer to sit in the back anyway.                                      Sit in the front                                                                                    Orion: Okay, I'll be your father's co-pilot, then. I could probably catch some Zs too.              Sit in the back with Luna                                                                           Orion: How about we both go in the back! ...If you don't mind the company, that is?                 Luna: No... not at all! I-If that’s what you want.                                                  Mr. Hernandez: Alright, is everyone ready?                                                          Orion: Yes, sir!                                                                                    Luna: Ready!                                                                                        Orion: Should I look for a spot to stop at for a quick dinner on the way?                           Luna: There are a couple of things to eat in the car, but... it'll probably be best if we stop at a diner on the road.                                                                                  Mr. Hernandez: Nonsense.                                                                            Luna: Ready!                                                                                        Mr. Hernandez: Very well, then.                                                                     Orion: Should I look for a spot to stop at for a quick dinner on the way?                           Mr. Hernandez: Nope, totally unnecessary! Luna woke up extra early today and cooked up a storm!     There are snacks and cookies and sandwiches, just for you!                                          Luna: They're for everyone!                                                                         Mr. Hernandez: But you went to the cafe expressly to get carrot cake because you know Orion loves   it. And besides, how am I supposed to eat if I’m driving your brother?                              Orion: Is there cake?!                                                                              Luna: Dad! Stop embarrassing me! And stop calling Fiero my brother!                                 Mr. Hernandez: Okay, okay, sorry sweetie. LET'S GO!                                                 Luna: Oh, looks like the rain finally caught up with us.                                            Orion: *Looking through the window* Yeah, I think it's about to... And there we go! Wow, it's really coming down out there.                                                                             Mr. Hernandez: Yeah, the internet said it would be raining until early morning.                     Orion: Well, at least it'll stop by the time we get there.                                          Mr. Hernandez: So they said, yeah. I hope you love the rain as much as my daughter does, Orion.     Orion: Oh, I do! I’m still getting used to living in Kredon, so I'm not tired of the rain yet!      Mr. Hernandez: Good! Luna could spend hours looking through a window during the rain.               Luna: It's just so... relaxing.                                                                     Orion: Will this be a problem? Having to drive such a long distance in this weather?                Mr. Hernandez: Not at all. The more it rains, the more the car will slide and the faster we'll      arrive.                                                                                             Orion: Um... I'm not sure that's how...                                                             Mr. Hernandez: LET'S GO!                                                                            Orion: Mmmmm...                                                                                     Luna: Are you feeling better, Orion?                                                                Orion: Mmm yeah, I think I am, thank you. All those curvy roads were giving me some motion          sickness... too bad we can’t roll the windows in this downpour. But I've started to feel much better after sitting back here.                                                                           Mr. Hernandez: This road is basically straight for about 50 miles. That should help.                Orion: *Looking through the window* Yeah, I noticed! Where are we now? I'm totally lost.            Mr. Hernandez: We left the state already! Now we're in... the middle of nowhere, basically. This    road is practically straight for about 50 miles, and then we just have to cross through some woods, and we'll be there.                                                                                 Orion: Great! What time is it, by the way? It's pitch-dark out there already.                       Mr. Hernandez: Mmmm... 11:55 PM.                                                                    Orion: Damn, really?! Time ran by so quickly!                                                       Luna: True. It seems like we left Kredon only a few minutes ago.                                    Orion: Must be the good company! You're really making time fly by.                                  Mr. Hernandez: Thank you, Orion. Luna and I have a pretty unique rapport, but you really seem to    have adapted to it quickly!                                                                         Orion: *Chuckles* Well, I was referring more to Luna, but it's impossible to get bored with you     around, Victor!                                                                                     Luna: That horror podcast we listened to before also helped. I was on the edge of my seat.          Orion: I know! It was amazing! Is it true that all the stories are based on real events?            Luna: Yeah, it is. It’s like a true crime series. They collect stories and testimonies from all over the country. I think they even had an episode about a homicide that happened around here...        Orion: W-What? Here as in... this road?                                                             Mr. Hernandez: Yeah, I remember what Luna’s talking about. There's a small side road about 12 or 20 miles from here. It leads to a farm where the son murdered his entire family.                       Orion: Holy shit...                                                                                 Luna: Found it! According to Google, he claimed to have been obeying voices inside his head. He     skinned them alive and cut off their limbs.                                                         Orion: *Gulps*                                                                                      Luna: The farm is abandoned nowadays, but this forum says that visitors have claimed to have seen   visions or heard voices...                                                                          Orion: My... g-god! That's some pretty good nightmare fuel.                                         Luna: It would be awesome to visit that farm one day... It's too bad we're on a tight schedule      today.                                                                                              Orion: Ah, yeah, you’re r-right. That's too bad. It would have been awesome. Darn it. (Thank you,   Jesus.)                                                                                             Luna: We can definitely visit it another day, though! It's not that far. Maybe once I have my       driver’s license.                                                                                   Orion: *Trying to change the subject* H-Hey, you know what we should do now?! Play a game! Anyone   have a suggestion?                                                                                  Mr. Hernandez: Why don't we play that thing we were playing the other day, Luna? That one about     guessing people.                                                                                    Luna: Sure! Do you wanna play, Orion?                                                               Orion: Play what?                                                                                   Luna: Do you know "20 Questions"? It's the same thing, but you only try to guess people, so we      reduced it to 10 questions. You have to guess the person I'm thinking about by asking a maximum of  10 yes or no questions. It can be a fictional person or a real one, and they can be dead or alive.  Play the game                                                                                       Orion: Sounds awesome! Let's do it. I can ask 10 questions about the person you're thinking about,  and you can only say yes or no, right?                                                              Luna: Correct.                                                                                      Orion: Alright! I’ll start guessing, then!                                                          Luna: Okay, let me think... Alright, I have one. Shoot.                                             Pass                                                                                                Orion: Oof, that sounds complicated. I'm not good at these things. There's just too many people in  the world. I don’t want to make a fool of myself.                                                   Luna: Do you have any other ideas?                                                                  Orion: Mmmm... Let me think...                                                                      Luna: And if I'm not mistaken... that was your 10th question! You have to guess now.                Orion: Oh! Alright... I think I know... Is it... Raul? Is it... Idriel? Is it... Nova? Is it...     Is this person a woman?                                                                             Luna: No!                                                                                           Orion: So it's a man...                                                                             Luna: Yes. Yes.                                                                                     Is this person famous?                                                                              Luna: Not that I'm aware of! Yes... you could say that. Nope.                                       Was this person born in the USA?                                                                    Luna: I don't think so. No. Yes.                                                                    Is this person living in the USA now, though?                                                       Luna: Yeah! The answer is still no!                                                                 Does this person go to our school?                                                                  Luna: Yes! No!                                                                                      Are they a movie star or a athlete?                                                                 Luna: Wrong!                                                                                        Is this person our age?                                                                             Luna: No!                                                                                           Orion: (Older or younger, then? Mmm... They have to be older... right?)                             Have I ever seen this person... in Eternum?                                                         Luna: Yeah, you have.                                                                               Is this person... pretty?                                                                           Luna: Um... Well, I guess that would be subjective, wouldn't it?                                    Mr. Hernandez: Not always! Look at me! I'm handsome! 100% objective.                                Luna: *Chuckles* No one can deny that!                                                              Mr. Hernandez: Like father, like daughter! Don't you think Luna's pretty, Orion? I always tell her  that, but she says I'm looking at her through a father's eyes.                                      Luna: D-Dad!                                                                                        Mr. Hernandez: Orion?                                                                               She's perfect                                                                                       Orion: She's perfect.                                                                               Mr. Hernandez: AH, YOU HA–                                                                          No opinion                                                                                          Orion: *Laughs* I prefer to stay out of this discussion.                                            Luna: S-Stop interrupting, Dad! Can we go back to the game?                                         Orion: *Chuckles* Hey, I asked a question and no one answered!                                      Luna: Because it depends on who you ask!                                                            Orion: Let me rephrase it, then... Is this person pretty... to you?                                 Luna: Oh... to me? Um... I wouldn't say that's their most defining trait. To me, at least.          Orion: *Chuckles* I understand.                                                                     Luna: Yeah! For sure!                                                                               Orion: Thank you!                                                                                   Luna: Yeah! Absolutely!!                                                                            Orion: Thank you!                                                                                   Is this person smaller than the average person?                                                     Luna: Nope. No. Mmm... yeah, you could say that.                                                    Orion: Ohh, interesting...                                                                          Is this person bigger than the average person, then?                                                Luna: You might say that, yes. Mmm... no, neither.                                                  Orion: Mmmm... average then, I see.                                                                 Is their hair brown?                                                                                Luna: Nope!                                                                                         Orion: Mmmmm... It's not who I was thinking, then...                                                Is this person alive?                                                                               Luna: I have to say... no, I guess. Yes. Yes.                                                       This person's eyes are green?                                                                       Luna: Um... *giggles* I don't know.                                                                 Orion: You... don't know? Ohhh...                                                                   Does this person usually have something covering their eyes?                                        Luna: Yes... Yes...                                                                                 Is this person an AI?                                                                               Luna: *Giggles* Yes!                                                                                Is this person a hacker?                                                                            Luna: *Giggles* Yes!                                                                                Does this person have a brother or a sister?                                                        Luna: Um... I'm not sure. But if not a brother... they have someone very close. Nope. Nope, only    child.                                                                                              Does this person have a prominent mustache?                                                         Luna: *Giggles* Yes! NO! Wrong!                                                                     Orion: Really? Dammit, I was positive I had it. Who was it?                                         Luna: Raul! Idriel! Nova!                                                                           Orion: Oh... OH! Now that you mention it, that makes sense! Okay, okay, now it's my turn!           Luna: YES! Good job!                                                                                Orion: NICE!                                                                                        Luna: You're really good at this!                                                                   Orion: Thanks! It's all about asking the right questions. Okay, okay, now it's my turn!             Luna: Think of someone.                                                                             Orion: Mmm... done! Are you ready?                                                                  Luna: Yes! Let me think... Is your person a woman?                                                  Yes                                                                                                 Orion: Yes!                                                                                         Luna: Is it me?                                                                                     No                                                                                                  Orion: No!                                                                                          Luna: Is it my father?                                                                              Orion: . . . Dammit. Why do I always suck at games?                                                 Luna: *Giggles* It's just that me and my father have played this a lot. A simple "yes" or "no" can  have a lot of meanings, depending on the tone.                                                      Orion: Let me try again!                                                                            Luna: Do you wanna play again?                                                                      Yes                                                                                                 Orion: You bet! I'm on a roll!                                                                      Luna: Okay, let me think of another one... Um... Alright, I'm ready.                                Orion: This time I'm gonna discover it even faster!                                                 No                                                                                                  Orion: No way! I'm taking my unbeaten record home!                                                  Luna: *Chuckles* Fair enough.                                                                       Mr. Hernandez: Hey guys, I hate to interrupt but... I'm seeing a gas station ahead, and I don't     really know if there are any others beyond this point. Can anyone check?                            Luna: Uh... according to Google Maps, this is the last one until Uncle Hugo's house.                Mr. Hernandez: Then we're gonna make a quick stop. You don't mind, do you?                          Luna: No problem!                                                                                   Orion: Damn, this place would be perfect for one of your stories, Luna. It could be the scenario of a horror movie.                                                                                     Mr. Hernandez: OH! He's very right! It looks half-abandoned, but the sign says “Open”. I'll head    inside to pre-pay the pump. If I'm not back in 3 minutes, come inside and avenge me.                Orion: *Laughs* I will, I promise.                                                                  Luna: *Stretching* GGGgggg...!                                                                      Orion: Are you feeling stiff?                                                                       Luna: Well, not that much, I just needed to stretch my legs for a moment. Although I do feel a bit  sleepy already.                                                                                     Orion: Yeah, I think it would be good for us to sleep a bit now. We'd be there by the time we wake  up and we'd feel much better tomorrow. I'm just sorry about your dad.                               Luna: Don't be. He always sleeps very little, and today he even woke up late. He'll probably be as  fresh as a daisy tomorrow.                                                                          Orion: That makes me feel better, then!                                                             Luna: I think I'll go back to the car now. *Slightly trembling* It's a little chilly out here.      Orion: Yeah, the rain has cooled the air! I'll go for a walk around the station while your father is inside. I'll be right back! Ahh, I love this smell. *Taking a deep breath* (I don't care what      people say, I love the rain, and I always will. I feel like I could never grow tired of it. It gives me... peace of mind.) . . . (Man, I want to stay here forever. If I can convince Annie and Chang to stay in Kredon as well... there would be nothing pulling me back home. I mean, Dad has only called me once since I got here. He wouldn’t even care. And the people I’ve spent time with this month have all been so amazing. I can't leave them behind. I just... can't. Imagine studying at the University of Kredon! With all the girls! And Chang! God knows what amazing things we could get up to in those 4 years... *Trembling* Uggh, I'm starting to feel a bit cold too. I should get back to the–) . . . What... *Nervous laugh* What? I-Is this a tribute of some sort or...? H-Has that thing always been  there? W-What the fuck is going on...? H-How... *Turning around on a whim* W-WHO'S THERE?! THIS IS  NOT FUNNY! (What the fuck are these whispers?!) *Hyperventilating* I K-KNOW Y-YOU'RE THERE! (Fuck,  not this goddamn migraine again...) W-Whoever it is, show yourselves! ENOUGH! (W-Where's this voice coming from?!) *Spinning on yourself* F-FUCKERS! STOP!!! *Hyperventilating* Wha...                  Player: I don't give a shit about who you are! If you don't pay me, I'll put some dents into you! Do you think I won't do it because you're a woman? Because I will!                                    Calypso: Oh, please, I just drank one cup of that thing you call “ale”. You should be grateful that the Princess deigned to step into your filthy inn, commoner.                                        Player: Look, this outfit and roleplay of yours might work on horny teenagers, but not me. This is  my real job, and I won't let you leave without paying.                                              Calypso: *Sighs* As I have told you, I do not have any money with me now. We will need to discuss a compromise. As soon as I can access the treasury housed in El–                                      Player: ENOUGH! PAY ME NOW, BITCH! OR ELSE...                                                       Calypso: ...OR ELSE WHAT?!                                                                          Player: H-Holy shit!                                                                                Calypso: I AM CALYPSO, PRINCESS OF THE SY-TEL-QUESSIR. I AM THE LAST OF MY BLOODLINE. I WAS BORN TO RULE OVER ALL RACES! AND NEITHER YOU NOR ANYONE ELSE CAN COMMAND ME!                                Player: O-Okay, okay! Jesus Christ, please don't kill me, I'm level 24 already!                     Calypso: Get out of my sight!                                                                       Player: Y-Yes!                                                                                      The man leaves the inn running for his life.                                                        Calypso: And from now on, I can drink here without paying!                                          Player: O-Of course! It's on the house!                                                             Calypso: How dare he...                                                                             Orion: Why... W-Why am I seeing this...?                                                            Calypso: Huh? Orion? When did you get here?                                                         Orion: What...? You can hear me?                                                                    Calypso: Orion!                                                                                     Orion: Yeah! It's me! I don't know how I got here!                                                  Luna: Orion!                                                                                        Orion: What?                                                                                        Luna: Orion!                                                                                        Orion: F-FUCK! Wha... What?! Where am I...?                                                         Luna: At the gas station. You started screaming and talking alone all of a sudden.                  Orion: *Recovering your breath* Oh... oh god... That was so scary! I-I don't know what happened, I  started seeing Exit Portals, and voices, and then I was in some kind of medieval inn... I even saw  Calypso!                                                                                            Luna: Like... a bleeding case?                                                                      Orion: Bleeding? Oh, that thing when people start hallucinating Eternum servers in the real world?  God, it's possible... But I thought that only happened to people who had spent thousands and        thousands of hours in Eternum!                                                                      Luna: You've been playing a lot during the past weeks, though. While having pretty intense sessions. And maybe the 100% compatibility accelerated things too.                                           Orion: Mmmm... yeah, it's a possibility.                                                            Luna: In any case, Ulysses made it clear that the bleeding isn't dangerous, so don't worry! A       weekend without playing Eternum will do you good.                                                   Orion: Yeah... I guess you're right. I'm not gonna log into Eternum until next week! I've probably  been playing too much lately. And while I was logged off, I was still thinking about it... I needed to touch some grass!                                                                                Luna: Exactly!                                                                                      Clerk: Thank you very much, come back soon!                                                         Mr. Hernandez: HAHA! We just hit the jackpot, guys! They're having a promotion where you can get two full sacks of coal for free if you fill your tank! TWO! I can smell next week's BBQ already!       Everyone back to the car, quickly!                                                                  Luna: What do you say? Should we get back on the road?                                              Orion: For sure! I feel fine already, it was just a scare. Let's go! (I know that what happened is  supposed to be “normal”, but... damn. I wasn't expecting the bleeding to feel so real. It felt like I was really playing Eternum. I could see Calypso as if she was really in front of me... I even     almost tried to talk to her. Heh, I can't wait to tell her what happened. Luna's right, though. A   few days of not playing will do me good. I don't want it to happen again. I mean, what if it        happened while going down some stairs? Or driving?! What if–)                                       You suddenly feel Luna's head falling over your shoulder as she falls asleep.                       Orion: *Chuckles* (She did say she was starting to feel sleepy. She looks so cute while she sleeps.)Do nothing                                                                                          Orion: *Yawns* (I should try to get some sleep too. Tomorrow's an action-packed day, so I've gotta  be full of energy! I wonder if it will still be raining when I wake up...)                          Put your arm around her                                                                             Luna: *Talking in her sleep* Thank you for coming, Orion...                                         Orion: *Chuckles*                                                                                   Luna: We must return the body we exhumed to kill all the zombies...                                 Orion: . . .                                                                                        Caress her body                                                                                     Orion: (Sometimes it's hard to notice because of the way she dresses, but Luna has such a nice      body... Even with this hoodie... I can almost feel her figure pressed against me... I wonder if     she's wearing a bra. Maybe I could have a little feel through her clothes? She wouldn't notice...)  Mr. Hernandez: *Clears throat*                                                                      Orion: *Looking up in the rearview mirror* *Gulps*                                                  Mr. Hernandez: Is everything okay back there, Orion?                                                Orion: P-Perfectly fine, sir!                                                                       Mr. Hernandez: Good! Good... You should try to get some sleep now.                                  Orion: I-I'll try, sir! (Jesus, that was scary... He's right, though. I should try to get some sleep too. If I can...) Zzzzz...                                                                         Mr. Hernandez: Hugo! We're here! Come on, kids, wake up!                                            Luna: Mmm... . . . ?                                                                                Orion: Zzzz...                                                                                      Mr. Hernandez: HUGO!                                                                                Orion: Hmm...? (Oh, we’re already here?) *Yawns* AAaaaghh! G-God, I slept like a baby! This car sure is comfortable, Mr. H.                                                                             Mr. Hernandez: Good morning, Orion! Welcome to the mountain!                                        Orion: Ah, thanks! I can already feel the folksy... . . . Huh? What?! W-What is this?               Luna: Huh? What do you mean?                                                                        Orion: This house!                                                                                  Luna: Uncle Hugo's house?                                                                           Orion: I-It's a luxury mansion! You're a Bardot too, or what?!                                      Luna: *Chuckles* No! My uncle bought this house some years ago. He makes a very good living.        Orion: You can say that again! Look at this house, goddamn!                                         Luna: He even offered to help us pay the bills a few years ago when things got worse at the cafe,   but my father refused.                                                                              Orion: Ah, I know that feeling. I'm just as stubborn as him.                                        Mr. Hernandez: And that's a good quality to have, in my opinion. If you believe in something, don't let it go. Look at the cafe now, doing better than ever!                                            Orion: Good advice!                                                                                 Luna's uncle: Victor, pedazo de cabrón!                                                             Mr. Hernandez: AH! Aquí está el pinche pendejo más feo que ha salido de México! Dame un abrazo,     perro!                                                                                              Luna's uncle: *Patting his back* JAJA! Te veo viejo y gordo, hermanito!                             Mr. Hernandez: *Laughs* Chinga tu madre cabrón, al menos yo tengo pelo!                             Orion: What are they saying?                                                                        Luna: Um... They say they're so happy to see each other. ...sort of.                                Mr. Hernandez: Ah, yes, do you remember what I told you on the phone, Hugo? We should try to speak  in English today, out of respect for Orion.                                                         Luna's uncle: Of course, of course! No problemo! I just got so excited when I saw my dear family    after so many months, my bad.                                                                       Luna: Hi, Uncle!                                                                                    Luna's uncle: BUT LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL GIRL! You've grown so much since the last time I saw you,  Luna! I still can't believe how you can be so pretty after having a father so ugly.                 Luna: T-Thank you.                                                                                  Luna's uncle: And look at this! You need to spend more time with us! You've lost your accent!       Luna: But I was born and raised in Kredon. I've never had an accent.                                Luna's uncle: Oh, really? Well, you have to spend more time with us anyway! And finally... ah,      hello, young man.                                                                                   Orion: Hello, sir!                                                                                  Luna's uncle: I guess you must be Orion, Luna's boyfriend.                                          Luna: W-What? What have you told them, Dad?!                                                        Mr. Hernandez: Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie. I just told them Orion was your friend. And he's a boy, so... boy-friend, no? Isn't that how it works? I'm sorry, my English is no bueno.                        Luna: You've been living in the States for 30 years, your English is perfect!                       Mr. Hernandez: Sometimes I still have trouble with it...                                            Play along                                                                                          Orion: *Chuckles* That would be me, Luna's boy-friend. Nice to meet you.                            Luna: Orion, don't play along!                                                                      Luna's uncle: *Laughs* Nice to meet you, Orion! I'm glad you came.                                  Correct him                                                                                         Orion: *Chuckles* Yeah, I'm not her boyfriend. I'm just a friend from school. Luna and Mr. Hernandez invited me to lunch today, and I couldn't refuse.                                                  Luna's uncle: Well, we aren’t planning on anything too special, but I hope you enjoy your time here! I can guarantee you will have at least a pleasant morning and a good meal!                         Orion: Oh, of that I am certain!                                                                    Luna's uncle: Please, come inside. Feel free to explore the house and grab whatever you want from   the kitchen. My home is your home.                                                                  Orion: Thank you very much! You have a lovely house, Mr. Hernandez.                                 Luna's uncle: And you still haven't seen the views from the back balcony. They're spectacular!      Luna's grandma: *Going down the stairs* Victor? Is that you? Hugo? Is it him?                       Mr. Hernandez: MAMA! I missed you so much! Give me a...                                             Luna's grandma: *Smacks him with her cane*                                                          Mr. Hernandez: Ouch.                                                                                Luna's grandma: You're late!                                                                        Mr. Hernandez: I-I know, sorry. I stopped to have a coffee because I was feeling sleepy.            Luna's grandma: You were driving sleepy? With Luna in the car?!                                     Mr. Hernandez: That's why I stopped!                                                                Luna's grandma: Mmmm... anyway, it's halfway through the morning already, we have to start cooking! Mr. Hernandez: Yes, Mama!                                                                           Luna's uncle: Hehehe...                                                                             Luna's grandma: *Smacks him with her cane* And you, what are you laughing at?! Go prepare the pool  for Luna and her friend! And clean your room!                                                       Luna's uncle: Y-Yes, Mama!                                                                          Mr. Hernandez: Hehehe...                                                                            Luna's grandma: Oh my sweet summer child... Each day you look more like an angel!                   Luna: Thanks, Grandma.                                                                              Luna's grandma: You have your mother's flawless skin... Is your father feeding you well? You look so skinny!                                                                                            Luna: He is, yeah.                                                                                  Luna's grandma: Well... at least you'll eat properly during these two days. I'll make sure to       prepare enough food so you can take leftovers home.                                                 Luna: Thank you!                                                                                    Luna's grandma: Welcome, Orion! It's nice to meet you. My son has told me so many nice things about you.                                                                                                Orion: Thank you so much, Ms. Hernandez! I feel so honored to be invited. I appreciate it a lot.    Luna's grandma: The pleasure is mine. Luna never brought friends home to play with when she was     little, so it was a pleasant surprise when Victor told me that she wanted to invite someone.        Orion: I'm happy to hear that! Luna is a wonderful person.                                          Luna's grandma: Oh, I know. She'd give anything for others. Anything. Her mother was like that too. But anyways, go jump in the pool! We'll start cooking in the meantime.                              Orion: Are you sure you don't need us to help?                                                      Luna's grandma: Absolutely! Go and have fun. We'll call you if we need anything.                    Orion: Alright then, thank you! (Luna's family is so kind. I’m basically a stranger, and they’re    inviting me with open arms.)                                                                        Mr. Hernandez: Orion! Luna went to wash her face and get changed. You can grab a swimsuit from the  bathroom and use the pool too, if you want.                                                         Orion: That sounds wonderful! Thank you very much, Victor.                                          Mr. Hernandez: Actually, hang back a second... Now that we're alone, can I ask you something?       Orion: Of course.                                                                                   Mr. Hernandez: Um... What are your intentions with my daughter?                                     Orion: Um... E-Excuse me?                                                                           Mr. Hernandez: I mean, I know I like to joke around and everything, but... I just wanted to know how you feel about my daughter. She cares a lot about you, and I just want to make sure that her       feelings are in the right place.                                                                    Orion: Uh...                                                                                        She's just a friend                                                                                 Orion: I mean... she's a friend of mine. A very good friend! But... that's it. I don't see her as... anything else.                                                                                     Mr. Hernandez: . . . I see. That's perfectly fine. I'm sure you two can be great friends. Just...   try not to hurt her, Orion. I know she's not the most bubbly or affectionate girl on the outside,   but I’m sure you’ve seen how big her heart is. She cares... almost too much.                        Orion: I'd never intentionally hurt her, Victor.                                                    Mr. Hernandez: I know. You're a good lad, Orion. I like to think that I'm a good judge of character. *Clears throat* But anyway, I don't want to keep you any longer. I have some tacos to cook! Go have fun!                                                                                               Orion: Will do! Thanks!                                                                             I like her                                                                                          Orion: I mean... well... I like her. A lot. Luna was basically the first new person I met in Kredon, and getting to know her has been one of the highlights of my stay here. I don't know what will     happen in the future, but... even if I'd like to be with her, I'd never try to force her into       anything. She’s been nothing but kind to me and my friends since I’ve met her.                      Mr. Hernandez: I know. *Chuckles* I won't get in the way, don't worry. All I want is for my daughter to be happy. Growing up, Luna didn’t have the easiest childhood, and she went through a lot.       Bullies, trauma... and especially her mom’s death. It’s why I’m always trying to keep her laughing  and keep a smile on her face, I don’t want to see my daughter that sad ever again.                  Orion: Yeah... Luna has told me about some of the stuff you’ve mentioned, I can only imagine what   that must have been like for a young girl. You’re a good father, Victor.                            Mr. Hernandez: I've noticed her smiling a lot more often this past month. I have to believe it’s due to you. Thanks for keeping a smile on my little girl’s face, Orion.                                Orion: Thank you, Victor. That really means a lot to me.                                            Mr. Hernandez: Anyways, I don't want to keep you much longer. Thanks for having this talk with me.  Just remember to follow your heart and listen to its guidance.                                      Orion: Will do!                                                                                     Mr. Hernandez: Just one more thing... If you EVER hurt her, I will hunt you down across the outback till the day I die, Orion.                                                                          Orion: W-What?!                                                                                     Mr. Hernandez: I know she's not the most bubbly or affectionate girl on the outside, but I’m sure   you’ve seen how big her heart is. Don’t you DARE take advantage of her. I couldn't bear to see her  suffer.                                                                                             Orion: I-I'd never dare!                                                                            Mr. Hernandez: That girl is everything I have in this life. Everything. If you ever harm her in any way... I will kill you, Orion. I swear to god.                                                      Orion: I C-COULD NEVER HURT HER! NEVER!                                                             Mr. Hernandez: I know! I know you're a good lad, Orion. I'm a good judge of character.              Orion: *Gulps* Thank you, sir.                                                                      Mr. Hernandez: Well, I have some tacos to cook! Go have fun!                                        Orion: T-Thanks! (God, Mr. H sure knows how to be scary. But I guess he's just a father who cares   about his daughter. I mean, I get it. In the little time I’ve known Luna, I’ve grown super fond of  her. It would kill me seeing her suffer, I can't even imagine how Victor would feel. Hmm... did I   say the right thing? Yeah, I think I did. I’ve only known Luna for less than two months, it’s way   too early to think about relationship stuff. Hopefully being honest will put Victor at ease a little bit. I do agree with him though, I just want Luna to be happy. Maybe she just has this effect on   people... But anyway, I think I'm ready here! Let's go to the pool, she must be there already.)     Hmm... I'm gonna leave my boxers right here. I just need my swimsuit and a towel.                   You catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror.                                                      Orion: Hmm? (Hey... Is it just my imagination... ...or am I looking more buff lately? But that’s    impossible. I’ve been so busy since coming to Kredon that I’m actually going to the gym less than I went back home.) . . .                                                                              You flex your muscles and start posing.                                                             Orion: (I definitely look stronger, though. Must be the lighting. Or maybe Nancy’s food. I mean,    I've been either at school, or playing around in Eternum for the last few weeks. Huh, imagine if all that exercise done in Eternum made you stronger in the real world too? It would be the end of all  the gyms around the world. Kai would have to find a new way to flirt. Hmm... God, I feel so silly   posing like this. Should I take a pic and ask someone? Both Annie and Chang saw me at the beach     before we moved to Kredon. They'll be able to tell if it’s all in my head.)                         Send a photo to Chang                                                                               Orion: (Chang will know.)                                                                           Send a photo to Annie                                                                               Orion: (Annie is probably the better option. Hmm... Is this a good frame? I've never been much of a selfie-guy.)                                                                                        You snap a few shots of yourself.                                                                   Orion: (Yeah, this will do. I'll send her the pic and check what she said later. I'll send him the  pic and check what he said later. Shit, I've gotta join Luna at the pool. She must be thinking I'm  doing something else here... Let's go! Man, this house is amazing. I've gotta buy one like this one day... if I ever have the money. I’ve gotta find out what Luna’s uncle does for a living.)          You hear some splashing in the water.                                                               Orion: (Oh my god... And just like that... all my cares go up in smoke. Ms. Hernandez was right,    she’s angelic. Damn... Look at that skin... it doesn't have a single defect. She looks so...)       Luna: *Turning around* Hi Orion!                                                                    Orion: Oh, h-hi, Luna!                                                                              Luna: I was starting to think that something had happened to you. Toilet troubles?                  Orion: N-No! Not at all! Sorry, I got distracted looking at the views from upstairs.                Luna: Yeah, they're great, aren't they?                                                             Orion: For sure...                                                                                  Luna: *Sitting down* We're lucky it's sunny today, we would have gotten cold after getting out of   the water otherwise.                                                                                Orion: Yep, it feels nice to be able to take advantage of the last warm days of the year.           Luna: You have to try the water!                                                                    Orion: On it! Make room!                                                                            You jump into the water with a clean jump.                                                          Orion: (Man, Luna’s bikini doesn’t really leave much to the imagination... If she wasn't so         introverted, she'd be so popular. She definitely has the looks for it. I mean, look at that. I      already saw her body in Warthogs, but... that wasn't really her. It wasn’t the same. I guess she    feels really comfortable around me. Maybe we can– F-Fuck, I've gotta breathe!) *Taking a gulp of    air* AAah!                                                                                          Luna: Are you okay? Don’t drown!                                                                    Orion: *Coughs* Y-Yeah! I overestimated my lung capacity. The water's great, though! You were right. Aren't you getting in again? I wouldn't want you to burn.                                          Luna: Actually, you can get sunburnt while you're swimming, too. I have to put sunscreen of the     maxim–                                                                                              Orion: Um...  Do you have a chicken on your head right now...? Or did I hit my skull against the    bottom of the pool?                                                                                 Luna: Pancho!                                                                                       Orion: Pancho?                                                                                      Luna: *Petting Pancho* He's my uncle's chicken. He saved him from an illegal cockfight in Tijuana 4 years ago.                                                                                          Orion: No way! *Laughs* That is so awesome. And he lives here now?                                  Luna: Yeah! He’s always clucking around, right behind my uncle. I think he’s also become attached to me, though. I was surprised he remembered me when I visited last year. Chicken memory is better    than what is believed.                                                                              Orion: *Chuckles* That's pretty cool. Now I want a chicken too!                                     Luna: He probably wants to swim with us. He's not particularly fond of the water, but he loves his  swan float.                                                                                         Orion: Is that it, Pancho? You want to chill by the pool with us? I love this chicken. *Getting on  the floatie* This is so nice, Luna. It feels good to be able to relax for a bit. Kinda hungry       though, you think I should grab something to eat quickly?                                           Luna: *Getting on the floatie* Don’t even think about it! If my grandma catches you snacking before their feast is prepped, she'll get mad.                                                             Orion: Oh shit, better not to piss her off, then! (Man, it feels great to just sit back and relax   with Luna. I should probably take this chance to find out more about her. Especially after that chat with Mr. Hernandez... We haven’t ever really discussed her power, either. Not since the last time  at her house, when it didn’t seem to work on me.)                                                   “Do I look stronger to you?”                                                                        Orion: Hey, I wanted to ask you something... Do I seem... stronger to you? I mean, I was looking at myself in the mirror earlier when I was putting on my trunks, and I felt that I looked... different. It’s almost like I’ve gained straight muscle, without gaining any fat, while I’ve been in Kredon!  Which is weird, because I haven't worked out in a while, and between Nancy’s cooking and your cafe, I've been eating more than ever lately.                                                             Luna: Well... It's... it's the first time I've seen you shirtless, so I can't really compare it to  anything.                                                                                           Orion: (Oh... that’s right, Luna wouldn’t have ever seen me shirtless before... She's not even in   the same swimming class as me, Dalia, and Alex. Oh shit, I hope she doesn’t think I’m just trying to flex how I look or something. I don’t want to come off as a cocky asshole.)                        Luna: But... You have a very... g-good body.                                                        Orion: (Guess not. Smooth move, Orion...)                                                           Luna: I wasn't expecting you to look so cut. I mean... you looked fit, but not like... this. I can  tell you work out a lot.                                                                            Orion: Oh, thank you, Luna! You look great in a bikini too...                                       Luna: Oh please, I'm just skinny.                                                                   Orion: Come off it! You look fantastic. Do you do any sports?                                       Luna: Not really. Sometimes I’ll ride my bike around town to pick up groceries or supplies, but     that's it.                                                                                          Orion: Must be the taco diet, then.                                                                 Luna: *Chuckles* Must be that!                                                                      “Can you speak Spanish?”                                                                            Orion: You know... I'm curious, can you speak Spanish?                                              Luna: Of course! What, did you think I made up what my father and uncle were saying earlier?        Orion: No, no! I mean, it could be that you understand it, but can’t speak it. Having grown up in   Kredon and all that. A couple of my friends are like that.                                          Luna: Oh... I see. I know some people like that too, yeah. But yes, I can. My father taught me when I was just a kid. He and my mother only spoke in English, though. I can speak both languages without an accent.                                                                                         Orion: That's awesome! I wish I had learnt a second language when I was younger. Can you say        something in Spanish?                                                                               Luna: Um... Gracias por venir, Orion. Me gusta mucho pasar tiempo contigo.                          Orion: Hey! I heard my name there! What did you say?                                                Luna: *Chuckles* I just said that I'm glad you came with us today.                                  Orion: Ah, I'm glad to be here too, senorita! Your voice sounds really different when you speak in  Spanish! Almost musical. (She sounded sexy as fuck... I'm not sure why. I need to get her to speak  Spanish more often!)                                                                                “Do you have any hobbies?”                                                                          Orion: How do you like to spend your free time? You know, besides Eternum. Any other hobbies?       Luna: Well, to be honest, when I'm not in school or helping my dad at Loco's, I spend most of my    free time in Eternum. Although... sometimes I like to watch horror movies, or... shows and          documentaries about serial killers. I... I know it's a little weird.                                Orion: It's not! I love those too. As long as you don't watch them to get ideas...                  Luna: *Laughs* Of course not!                                                                       Orion: *Chuckles* No, but seriously, I know a lot of people who are “fascinated” by serial killers, me included. It's like... it appeals to our basic instinct of survival. Seeing what drives them to  kill, what makes them “tick”. I think it's really interesting.                                      Luna: Exactly!                                                                                      Orion: We should see one of these movies together some day. Have a little horror night!             Luna: T-That would be great!                                                                        Orion: I'll take a look at my collection... There HAS to be something good coming up on Netflix     soon. All of their shows have just been okay since Ulysses bought them out.                         “Don't you want to take your gloves off?”                                                           Orion: Can I ask a more personal question? And please, let me know if I'm overstepping. Don't you   want to take your gloves off? I noticed you were still wearing them earlier. You have nothing to    fear, there's only us in this pool. Well... and Pancho.                                             Luna: Oh... it's just a force of habit. I'm not used to taking them off... like, ever. But I guess I could do it now. Like you said... it's just us.                                                    Orion: Don't feel forced to! If you feel more comfortable this way then you–                        Luna: No... it's okay. I want to do it.                                                             Luna gets out of the floatie and leaves her gloves poolside.                                        Luna: . . .                                                                                         Orion: *Approaching her* Better?                                                                    Luna: *Breathing rapidly* Y-Yeah.                                                                   Orion: (Shit, she looks so anxious. Maybe I shouldn't have said anything. It'd probably be better if she put them on again.) S-Sorry, I shouldn't have said anything! You can–                          Luna: No, you're right. I need to get used to it.                                                   Orion: It's completely understandable to want them back on.                                         Luna: Can I... Can I touch you?                                                                     Orion: Touch me...?                                                                                 Luna: Yeah, I mean... Like the last time I took my gloves off.                                      Orion: Oh... of course! (How could I refuse when she says it with that sweet voice...)              Luna: . . .                                                                                         Small goosebumps appear all over Luna’s body as she slowly lays both of her hands on your chest.    Luna: I-I still can't believe this. I'm touching someone with my bare hands and not having any      visions! No visions at all!                                                                         Orion: That's... still a good thing, right...?                                                      Luna: Of course! It's amazing!                                                                      Orion: Any idea yet on why I'm the only person on whom your power doesn't work?                     Luna: I don't know...                                                                               Orion: (It's so weird. Maybe she only has visions with some people? I feel like we should look into it and experiment with her power a little bit. But I don't want to force her into anything. As much as I want to help her, we should move at her pace.)                                                 Luna: You're... so warm.                                                                            Orion: Hmm?                                                                                         Luna: You...                                                                                        She stops mid-sentence and stares straight into your eyes.                                          Luna: You... . . .                                                                                  Orion: (This moment... It's the same as when she touched my face for the first time at her house.)  Luna: . . .                                                                                         Orion: (All I want to do is hold her against me and crash my lips into her mouth... I can't waste   this chance. It's now or never.)                                                                    Kiss her                                                                                            Before you make a move, Luna quickly slips out of reach and goes back to the floatie.               Orion: (W-Wha...)                                                                                   Back off                                                                                            Orion: W-Well, I guess we can go back to the floaties now. Much better without the gloves, right?   Luna: W-What? Ah, yeah, sure... *Clears throat* T-Thank you, Orion, I feel much better now.         Orion: Um... I-I'm glad! You can touch me whenever you want! (God, that sounded so bad.)            Luna: T-Thanks. Will do.                                                                            Orion: (Change the subject, Orion, this is such a nice moment, don't make it awkward...) Uh... you  know what we should do now?! Just take a beat and listen to the sounds of the valley for a minute!  Luna: Ah! That sounds great, actually. I like the sound of the mountain.                            Orion: Right?                                                                                       Stop asking                                                                                         Orion: You know, I think I'm gonna follow Pancho's steps. Just take a beat and listen to the sounds of the valley.                                                                                      Luna: Sure! That sounds great, actually. I like the silence.                                        Orion: *Lying down* Ahh... This is the life. Can you imagine how it would feel to not have any      obligations?                                                                                        Luna: Like... not having to go to school?                                                           Orion: Yeah! No school, no job, no worrying about the future, no concerns at all... just a pool,    your pet chicken, and the morning sunlight.                                                         Luna: *Chuckles* It doesn't sound half bad.                                                         Luna's grandma: Luna! Come on, get out of the pool!                                                 Luna: Already? We just got into the water. Is the food already done?                                Luna's grandma: Not yet, but your father can handle the rest. It's time to dress up!                Luna: This year too?                                                                                Luna's grandma: Of course! I need my annual picture of my granddaughter. Hurry up, I'll be waiting  in the dining room.                                                                                 Luna: Okay, okay...                                                                                 Orion: Dress up?                                                                                    Luna: Yeah, each year, my grandma puts me in a dress and covers me in Day of the Dead makeup. I know it makes her happy, so I don't really mind.                                                        Orion: Oh boy! I've gotta see that! You better hurry up! She looked pretty formidable with that cane of hers!                                                                                           Luna: *Giggles* Okay, but promise not to laugh at me.                                               Orion: Never!                                                                                       Luna's grandma: Alright! Are you ready? Let's go upstairs, Luna.                                    Luna: Is it the same dress as last year?                                                            Luna's grandma: No, it's not! Actually, I made this one myself. I've been sewing for 4 weeks. I hope you like it.                                                                                       Luna: I'm sure I'll love it, yaya. Thank you!                                                       Luna's grandma: You’re such a sweetheart, mija. Let's do your makeup first, so you can get dressed  by yourself while I do Orion's makeup.                                                              Orion: What? Me too? Makeup?                                                                        Luna's grandma: Day of the Dead makeup! It's a tradi–                                               Mr. Hernandez: BE CAREFUL!                                                                          Luna's uncle: OH SHIT, the chilaquiles!                                                             Mr. Hernandez: AARGH! They're all over the floor!                                                   Luna's uncle: Okay, okay, don't worry, we can replace them with something else... Ah, wait, I think I have hamburger buns!                                                                              Mr. Hernandez: Oh! Great idea, should we get some fries from McDonald’s too?                        Luna's uncle: Taste this beef before you talk, trust me. This cow was raised in better living       conditions than any of us. I have steak too, if you prefer.                                         Mr. Hernandez: I'll see what I can do... Hey, where's the blue cheese? It was here just a second    ago. HEY! THAT FUCKING CHICKEN TOOK MY CHEESE! I'M GONNA KILL HIM!                                  Luna's uncle: *Gasps* Take that back!                                                               Orion: Um... Are they gonna be okay...?                                                             Luna's grandma: Of course! Don't worry about those two butterfingers. Let's focus on our thing. I   left some clothes in the guest bedroom. You can start getting changed, if you want.                 Orion: *Laughs* Alright then!                                                                       Luna: I'm sorry you got dragged into this, Orion.                                                   Orion: No problem! It actually sounds pretty fun. See you both in a minute! (Wow, another huge room. A house with all these bells and whistles must cost a fortune. Hmm... is that what I'm supposed to wear? Huh, country style. I like it. These clothes feel like pillows. How are they so comfortable?) Luna's grandma: Orion? Are you ready?                                                               Orion: Yes, ma'am!                                                                                  Luna's grandma: *Gasps* Dios mio... You remind me so much of my husband... You look like a true     Hernandez now!                                                                                      Orion: Thanks!                                                                                      Luna's grandma: Okay, time to paint your face! *Plugging in the record player* Let me put something appropriate on... I'm gonna need you to close your eyes and stay quiet. If this paint gets in your  eye, you're gonna go blind forever. Do you understand?                                              Orion: *Gulps* Mm-hm.                                                                               Luna's grandma starts painting your face at a surprisingly rapid pace.                              Orion: This song sounds sad.                                                                        Luna's grandma: DON'T TALK! But yes, it's supposed to be. The original song tells the story of the  ghost of a woman who roams rivers and towns wailing for her children... whom she drowned.           Orion: Damn... that's terrible.                                                                     Luna's grandma: Orion!                                                                              Orion: Mm-hmm!                                                                                      Luna's grandma: Okay, just a bit more green here... Outline on the edges of this... Last details,   and... DONE! You're perfect!                                                                        Orion: Can I go look at myself in the mirror?                                                       Luna's grandma: THERE'S NO TIME! LET'S GO TAKE THE PICTURE! YOU HERE! And you over here! AAAH, YES! You look so beautiful! Hugo! Bring the camera! Take a few photos of them for the album while I make my ofrenda!                                                                                         Orion: Hmm?                                                                                         Luna: . . .                                                                                         Orion: Oh... DAMN! You look stunning, Luna!                                                         Luna: Thank you! You look great too.                                                                Orion: Your grandma is an artist!                                                                   Mr. Hernandez: *Sobbing* Oh god, is that my daughter?                                               Luna's uncle: You look so beautiful, Lunita!                                                        Luna: Thank you, Uncle!                                                                             Mr. Hernandez: Why do they grow so fast, Hugo? Why can't they stay small forever?                   Luna's uncle: *Laughs* Enjoy it while you can, Victor. My daughters left the nest before I'd even   realized!                                                                                           Mr. Hernandez: Alright then, let's take that picture! Pose for the camera! Perfecto! Mama will love it. A last one?                                                                                     Stay in the same position                                                                           Mr. Hernandez: Sweet!                                                                               Hold Luna by the waist                                                                              Orion: Better like this?                                                                            Mr. Hernandez: Ah, yes, now we're talking! This is a photo to remember! Sweet! Okay, okay, okay!    It's almost time to eat! Do you wanna join my mother at the ofrenda while we set the table, Orion?  I'm sure she'd appreciate it.                                                                       Orion: The ofrenda?                                                                                 Luna: It's an improvised altar we place at home during the Day of the Dead celebration to remember  those who passed away. My grandma takes it very seriously.                                          Orion: Oh... I'd rather not disturb her, then.                                                      Luna: On the contrary! Like my father said, I'm sure she'd appreciate it if you went. I'll go myself after you and my father leave later today.                                                         Join the ofrenda                                                                                    Orion: Well, in that case... I'd be honored to go.                                                  Luna: We'll start setting the table. I'll call you when it's ready.                                 Orion: Sounds good!                                                                                 Luna's uncle: Luna, come here, please! I want a photo of Pancho with you!                           Orion: (Hmm, looks like she's praying. Oh, could that be... Luna's mom?)                            Luna's grandma: Thank you for coming, sweetheart.                                                   Orion: I'm honored, Ms. Hernandez. Thank you for letting me be here. I was wondering... Is this     woman...                                                                                            Luna's grandma: Yes. That's Olivia, Luna's mother.                                                  Orion: I see... She looks a lot like her.                                                           Luna's grandma: And not only physically. She was just as sweet. The best daughter-in-law a mother   could have ever asked for. Behind his cheerful attitude, I know Victor still hasn't fully gotten    over her death, even after all these years.                                                         Orion: I'm sure she'd be really proud of both of them.                                              Luna's grandma: . . . I wish my sister was still alive. She'd be able to talk to her.               Orion: Talk to her...?                                                                              Luna's grandma: . . . My family has always had a certain connection to... the metaphysical realms.  My sister was able to communicate with the dead.                                                    Orion: She could speak with the dead...?                                                            Luna's grandma: Don't worry, I'm not asking you to believe me. No one ever did anyway. Most people  always thought she was just a liar, but I always believed her and her visions. She was no liar. She could see them, Orion. Happy. Sad. Isolated. Together. She used to say that each of the dead had    their own unique... “heaven”.                                                                       Orion: (Hmm... Could this be related to Luna's powers...? Maybe...)                                 Luna's grandma: But anyway, forgive me. And forget what I said! Today is a day to celebrate, not to mourn!                                                                                              Orion: O-Of course!                                                                                 Luna's grandma: Take care, Olivia. You still live in the hearts of the ones you left behind.        Say something                                                                                       Orion: I never met you, but if Luna is a testament to the kind of person you were, I can safely say you were a wonderful mother. I promise to look out for her, just like the rest of her friends and   family. Rest in peace, Olivia.                                                                      Luna's grandma: That was very nice, Orion. Thank you.                                               Remain silent                                                                                       Orion: . . .                                                                                        Luna: Sorry to disturb you. The food is ready!                                                      Luna's grandma: Don't worry sweetie, we were already done here. Let's go to eat!                    Orion: Yes! I'm starving! I don't know what it is, but it smells fantastic.                         Pass                                                                                                Orion: Still, this sounds like a very personal thing. I think I should stay here, actually.         Luna: O-oh. If that’s what you prefer.                                                              Mr. Hernandez: Please help me set the table, then. You can get the wine from the cellar.            Orion: On it! Damn, Victor! This is quite impressive!                                               Mr. Hernandez: Well, we were forced to change the original plan because someone forgot to buy the   ingredients I asked him to... but it'll do!                                                         Luna's uncle: Are you blaming me?!                                                                  Orion: There's more than enough! And everything looks delicious. *Sitting down* Are these your      famous tacos, Victor?                                                                               Mr. Hernandez: Correcto! Eat as many as you want, Orion!                                            Orion: Thanks, sir!                                                                                 Luna's grandma: Make sure to fill your plate too, Luna! You've gotta eat more!                      Luna: Yes, yaya...                                                                                  Orion: Oh, and by the way, thank you so much for inviting me to your house, Hugo.                   Luna's uncle: Ah, don't even mention it, Orion! It's my pleasure. I like having guests. I wish my   daughters would come visit me more often.                                                           Orion: I've gotta ask, though, what do you do for a living? A house this fancy MUST have cost a     fortune.                                                                                            Luna's uncle: Oh, that's actually a good question. You see, I'm running a cartel and a human        trafficking ring.                                                                                   Orion: *Laughs* Okay, I see that the joking around and sarcasm are genetic! *Laughs* Hahaha!        *Laughs* Haha! Haha... Ha... Ha.... Ha... W-Why is no one laughing...? . . . H-Hugo... what's your  job?                                                                                                Luna's uncle: . . .                                                                                 Orion: . . . U-Um... Hugo? V-Victor? Luna?!                                                         Luna's uncle: . . . HAHAHA! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I swear I tried, but I couldn't stop myself from  laughing!                                                                                           Orion: *Laughs* I knew it! This was just another one of your jokes, eh, Victor?                     Mr. Hernandez: *Chuckles* Damn, you’ve caught onto me so quickly. You’re right though! I couldn't   help it.                                                                                            Orion: Well, I'm glad that Hugo isn't involved in human trafficking.                                Luna's uncle: *Laughs effusively* God, no! I don't have the guts! I wouldn't hurt a fly, don't      worry, Orion! *Stops laughing* I do run a cartel, though.                                           Orion: You really had me goin– Wait, what?                                                          Mr. Hernandez: Oh, mama, can you pass me that picture from the shelf?                               Orion: W-We're still joking, right?                                                                 Luna's grandma: The one with Luna when she was little?                                              Mr. Hernandez: Yes!                                                                                 Luna: Dad!                                                                                          Mr. Hernandez: Come on, sweetie! You were adorable! Here it is! Do you wanna see it, Orion?         Orion: Of course! Awwww... That IS adorable! (Luna's already wearing her gloves, so I guess this pic was taken after her mother died.) How old were you here?                                           Mr. Hernandez: She was only 5 years old. I had just picked her up from kindergarten.                Luna: I was 11!                                                                                     Mr. Hernandez: Really? Damn, it feels like ages ago. *Sobbing* My little girl's growing up, right   before my eyes...                                                                                   Luna: *Whispering* Dad, please, you’re embarrassing me!                                             Orion: *Laughs* I love this photo.                                                                  Luna: Can we start eating already, please?                                                          Orion: Hell yes! I'm so hungry!                                                                     Mr. Hernandez: Try one of my tacos, Orion. It's my special, secret recipe! Like we discussed the    other day, they're EXTRA spicy!                                                                     Luna: Be careful, Orion. When my dad says extra spicy, he means it. The sauce is really spicy.      Orion: I appreciate the concern, but seriously, there's no need to worry. I can withstand spicy     food. *Grabbing a taco* I don't want to brag, but I used to add Tabasco to my spaghetti when I      started cooking my own meals. I think I've almost become immune to it! Aaaah... Mmmm... MMMMm!      Mthis–                                                                                              Mr. Hernandez: Is anything wrong, Orion? You don't like my tacos?                                   Orion: *Hyperventilating* (JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. Is my mouth on fucking FIRE?!)                     Mr. Hernandez: Are you okay? You started sweating quite a bit.                                      Luna's grandma: Orion, your paint! I'll have to redo it!                                            Orion: H-Huh? O-Oh? Haha! N-No, no! They're p-perfect! Absolutely delicious!                        Mr. Hernandez: Ah, I'm glad! I knew you'd appreciate them! You’re sure they’re not a little too     spicy for you?                                                                                      Orion: T-Too s-s-spicy? N-Not at all! This is just how my body typically reacts to ethnic food.     W-What's in them, o-out of curiosity?                                                               Luna's uncle: Ground beef, tomato, cheese, avocado, fresh garnishes, and Carolina Reaper, the       hottest chili pepper in the world!                                                                  Orion: Ah, yeah. I-It adds the perfect touch, I can t-taste it. C-Can I get a drink?                Mr. Hernandez: Of course! A michelada? It's a Mexican beer with chili-based spices, served in a     salt-rimmed glass!                                                                                  Orion: C-Chili...? S-sounds like exactly w-what I need, s-sir.                                      Luna: *Giggles*                                                                                     Mr. Hernandez: Like we discussed the other day, these shouldn’t be too spicy.                       Orion: *Grabbing a taco* That was probably a good call. I don’t have a very high spice tolerance.   Aaaah... Mmmm... mmmm! Mmm, this is mdelicious!                                                     Mr. Hernandez: Really? Do you like them?                                                            Orion: They're so tasty! But... are these supposed to be “slightly” spicy?! Phew, thank god I didn't ask you to prepare the extra spicy ones!                                                           Mr. Hernandez: *Laughs* I'd have paid to see your face!                                             Orion: Oh, can I grab one of those chicken wings?                                                   Mr. Hernandez: Of course! AAAaaghh... I can't eat another bite! I'm about to explode.               Orion: Yeah, I've never been so full. Everything was just too good! (Thank god they had milk to     counteract the spice...)                                                                            Luna: *Standing up* I'm going to clean my face and do some sunbathing on the upstairs terrace before the sun goes down.                                                                                 Mr. Hernandez: Of course honey, just make sure to put on some sunscreen.                            Orion: *Standing up* That sounds good! Do I have enough time to join her for a bit?                 Mr. Hernandez: Sure, no problem. We'll leave for Kredon in 20 or 30 minutes. I'll do the dishes in  the meantime.                                                                                       Orion: Sweet! Thank you, Victor. (It's too bad I can't spend some more time here with Luna. I feel  at home with their family. But hey, better make the most of it while I’m here!) *Entering the main  bedroom* Did I hear Pancho running around up here? Can he climb stairs?                             Luna: Yeah! Can you close the door? My uncle gets nervous when he can't find Pancho.                Orion: *Laughs* This damn chicken is smarter than any of us. I wouldn't be surprised if he knew how to open doors too. That's... Oh boy... (She took her dress off and put her bikini back on... I      thought I wouldn't be able to see her wearing it after we changed clothes. The God of Tits & Ass    smiles on me again!) You changed fast!                                                              Luna: Yeah, the dress was easy to take off. And the paint fades with a little water.                Orion: Yep, I noticed that. I almost felt bad while washing my face.                                Luna: Don't worry! We'll always have the photos we took. And we can come back another day. Yaya     loves putting make-up on people, and my uncle loves having visitors. I mean... if you ever want to  come back, of course. There's definitely enough rooms for an overnight stay. Like a big sleepover!  And I'm sure my family wouldn't mind. They really liked you.                                        Orion: The feeling is mutual! And I'd love to come back, of course. Thanks, Luna. We could even go  hiking! These mountains are beautiful.                                                              Luna: Right? There's a nearby pond with a small grotto where you can swim too.                      Orion: Oh man, I have to see that! Sign me up. I could spend hours just staring at these views. I   bet these woods hide a lot of secrets...                                                            Luna: Yeah, this terrace is my uncle's favorite spot in the house, actually.                        Orion: Oh, I can see why. I assume that’s why he installed this massage table here?                 Luna: Yeah, he told us he even hired a couple of masseuses to visit from time to time.              Orion: Ah, living the life!                                                                         Luna: It's very comfortable and it’s water-resistant, so I usually sunbathe here after a quick swim.Orion: I see...                                                                                     Offer to give her a massage                                                                         Orion: You know... we have a few minutes left, and I’m a pretty talented masseur myself... It'd be a shame to waste this table.                                                                         Leave                                                                                               Orion: (Hmmm... nah, there's not enough time. It would be rude of me to keep Mr. Hernandez waiting. And... it might be a bit too much, honestly. I don’t want to risk my friendship with Luna by        offering something weird like that.) Anyway Luna, it was great hanging out with you today. Thanks so much for inviting me! You’re a really great friend – sorry I’ve gotta leave so early.              Luna: Don't be! Today was awesome. You really made it a great day. I know it probably wasn't worth  it to come all the way up here just to spend a few hours swimming and tasting my dad's tacos, but... I really appreciate you visiting, Orion.                                                           Orion: It was DEFINITELY worth it! I had so much fun. I'll be the one inviting you somewhere next   time.                                                                                               Luna: Okay! That sounds good.                                                                       Orion: Will you be back in Kredon by Monday?                                                        Luna: Of course! And good luck on your mission with Nancy tomorrow... whatever that is!             Orion: Thanks! I'll make sure to tell you all about it. Goodbye, Luna.                              Luna: Bye! A massage...? Like... You're offering to give me one?                                    Orion: Yep! Do you remember Dalia's back injury? It was me who miraculously healed her in less than a week! Right in time for her competition. And it was all thanks to my special massage technique, of course.                                                                                            Luna: *Giggles* I remember her mentioning that, actually.                                           Orion: I am quite the massaging miracle worker!                                                     Luna: *Giggles* It definitely sounds promising.                                                     Orion: So... what do you say? Do you want one?                                                      Luna: Hmm... *Lying down* O-Okay. If you really don't mind... I won't say no. You’ve convinced me!  Orion: Sweet! No one can refuse one of my rubdowns!                                                 Luna: Well, I don't know many people who would refuse a free massage. Unless the person offering it had some sort of ulterior motive.                                                                   Orion: *Chuckles* There's no hidden agenda, I promise. I can use some sunscreen oil too, if you     want.                                                                                               Luna: Yeah, sure. I could use some of it on my lower back. There's a bottle under the table.        Orion: Excellent then! Thank you for signing up for our premier massage package here at Richards    Massage Parlor. Are you ready, ma'am?                                                               Luna: *Giggles* Sure.                                                                               Orion: (Sweet Lord have mercy... This view is almost too much...) *Taking a deep breath* (But       luckily, you're not an animal, Orion. Inhale and exhale, now... Though, if Luna wanted me to be an  animal...)                                                                                          Luna: Orion?                                                                                        Orion: *Clears throat* Y-Yeah! I was saying... Ah, yeah! Please, relax and prepare to enjoy the     experience, ma'am.                                                                                  Luna: *Giggles* Mm-hm.                                                                              You gently put your hands on Luna's lower back. Her skin immediately tenses, and her breathing      begins to pick up.                                                                                  Orion: Is everything okay?                                                                          Luna: Y-Yes. It's just that... your hands are cold.                                                 Orion: Oops, my bad. On the other hand, your skin feels really warm after being exposed to the sun  for such a long time. Sorry about that!                                                             Luna: No problem...                                                                                 You start massaging Luna's lower back at a steady pace, squeezing your fingers in a firm but tender manner.                                                                                             Orion: Your lower back muscles are really tense, Luna. You're full of knots.                        Luna: Am I?                                                                                         Orion: Yeah, totally.                                                                               Luna: And what's the solution?                                                                      Orion: Well, my years of massaging experience have prepared me for this. It'll have to be a lengthy treatment. You'll need lots of relaxing, periodic caresses from a trustworthy masseur.              Luna: *Giggles* That would be you?                                                                  Orion: You happen to be in luck, ma'am.                                                             Luna: *Giggles* I think that’s a treatment plan I can follow...                                     Little by little, Luna's muscles begin to relax, as the temperatures of your hands and her body even out.                                                                                               Orion: Starting to feel better?                                                                     Luna: Yeah... It feels... great.                                                                    Orion: I'm glad. Do you like to sunbathe when you have the opportunity?                             Luna: I do... But my skin is so pale that, even if I manage not to get sunburned, I end up with     ridiculous tan lines. So I usually avoid it.                                                        Orion: I see. You can remove the top of your bikini, if you want.                                   Luna: Hmm? What...?                                                                                 Orion: Uh, I mean... (Did that sound too forward?) You know, if you don't want tan lines. I-I’ve    heard that’s what Penny does to avoid tan lines for modeling shoots! I know that most women try to  avoid them.                                                                                         Luna: Oh... Sure... good idea. I’ll have to thank Penny next time I see her.                        Luna takes off her bikini top and drops it next to the table.                                       Luna: . . .                                                                                         Orion: (Damn, I didn’t think that’d work. But I'm glad it did...) Oof, your legs are super tense    too. You’re lucky that I got here in time!                                                          Luna: *Giggles* I'll have to recommend your services to everyone I know. You're very caring.        Orion: Well, it’s the duty of a good masseur to leave every one of their customers satisfied! Here  at the Richards Massage Parlor, customer satisfaction is priority numero uno!                       Luna: *Giggles* That's a good policy.                                                               Orion: (She's totally relaxed now. It feels like she trusts me completely. And for some reason that makes me feel special. I just want to make her feel... safe. Is that normal? I mean, fuck, I'm      massaging a half naked girl with a 10/10 body and I can only think of how nice it is that she's     feeling comfortable around me. Although... Well, now that I’m thinking about it... Jesus, Luna's    body is breathtaking. The way she's arching her back makes her curvy butt stand out even more. I    wonder if she's doing that on purpose...) All good, Luna? You're so quiet all of a sudden. Please   tell me you didn't fall asleep. That would be devastating for my customer reviews.                  Luna: No... I didn't. I'm feeling better than I thought I’d be. It's just that... I love the feeling of your hands. You weren’t exaggerating about your expertise. It's like a... p-pampering           sensation.                                                                                          Orion: Happy to hear that...                                                                        Get closer to her private parts                                                                     Orion: (God, this is so sexy. And Luna looks... receptive. I wonder what would happen if things got a bit more intimate. You know what? Fuck it. Nothing ventured, nothing gained!) Um... do you mind if I step it up a gear, Luna...?                                                                      Luna: Step it up a gear? What do you mean?                                                          Orion: Well, you know... Something like...                                                          You move your hand along Luna's thigh all the way up until you can feel her pussy lips through the  thin fabric of her bikini.                                                                          Luna: Aaah...                                                                                       She lets out a small moan from the back of her throat.                                              Luna: . . . . . . ?                                                                                 Luna suddenly sits up and moves away from you.                                                      Orion: (Oh, fuck.) I-I'm sorry! I didn't want to... I m-misread the signals, sorry.                 Luna: N-No! It's my fault. I... I-I liked it. But... It's just that... It startled me. I'm not used to physical contact. Yet. I'm sorry.                                                                Orion: Don't be sorry! That makes sense. The last thing I want to do is make you uncomfortable.     Let's just say that it was no one's fault!                                                          Luna: Yeah. Um... you should probably make sure you’re ready to leave, my dad’s probably almost done with packing the car. I’m gonna change too. I'll see you Monday at school!                         Orion: S-Sure!                                                                                      Luna: Thank you for coming, Orion.                                                                  She flees the terrace, with her breasts covered and her back turned towards you.                    Orion: (God, that was awkward. I feel so... guilty. We were having such a good time and then I went and upset her like that.) *Sighs* (Anyways, I guess I should go get dressed too. I just hope she's  not angry. Luckily, knowing Luna, I'm pretty sure that's not the case. Or so I hope...)             Don't push it                                                                                       Orion: If you want to change your position or you want me to change anything, just let me know. The most important thing is that you are comfortable.                                                   Luna: I'm doing terrific... Just... Do you mind if I turn around?                                   Orion: *Gulps* Not at all. (Oh boy... Is she going to put her top back on, or...?)                  Luna: *Turning around* Thank you.                                                                   Orion: (Doesn't seem to be the case...)                                                             Luna: T-This is a little embarrassing, though.                                                      Orion: Nonsense! You have nothing to worry about, our employees are strictly professional. Their    gaze never drifts to where it doesn't belong. Just relax and continue enjoying your massage, ma'am. Luna: *Giggles* Mm-hm...                                                                            Orion: (My god, Luna's skin feels softer than silk. She barely has any body hair, and it almost     looks like porcelain.)                                                                              Luna: . . .                                                                                         Orion: (She’s completely changed since the beginning of the massage. It almost feels like she’s     asking me to touch it... to caress it... I know she's not used to touching other people with her    bare hands, but she's probably not used to any other kind of physical contact either. Maybe that's  what makes it so special.)                                                                          The birdsong above is only interrupted by the noise of your hands rubbing up against Luna's body and the soothing sound of her soft sighs and small moans.                                              Orion: (Man, this is getting hotter and hotter every second, and we're not even saying anything. I  wonder what she's thinking right now. She looks so... receptive. Would it be crazy to try to make   things a little more intimate...?)                                                                  Luna: . . .                                                                                         Orion: Does it feel good, Luna?                                                                     Luna: Mm-hm...                                                                                      Orion: If you want me to change the position of my hands, you just have to say so.                  Luna: Your hands...?                                                                                Orion: Yeah, I mean... I wouldn't want to cross any line that could make you uncomfortable.         Luna: Oh... Don't worry... I feel safe in your hands. I feel... good.                               Orion: Alright...                                                                                   You move your hand along Luna's thigh.                                                              Orion: (Alright... she didn't flinch. So far so good...)                                            Luna lets out a slight moan.                                                                        Orion: Are you okay? I can sto–                                                                     Luna: N-No. Don't. Don’t stop. It feels good. I-I want you to touch me.                             Orion: Touch you?                                                                                   Luna: Yes. I want to... feel your hands all over my... body.                                        Orion: (Oh god. Did she really say that?!) Alright, ma'am... Here at Richards Parlor... the         customer's always right. Your wish... is my command...                                              You start rubbing the palm of your hand against Luna's pussy as delicately as possible.             Luna: *Slightly moaning* Aahh...                                                                    Orion: (Jesus... I can feel Luna's fleshy pussy through the fabric. She's wetter now than when she  was in the pool.)                                                                                   Luna: Aaaahh...                                                                                     Orion: *Looking at Luna's chest* (Damn, Luna's tits sure are bigger than they seem at first glance). (She can barely cover them with her arm. Come on... let me see those pink nipples... Please...)    Luna's fidgeting accelerates, and her breath hastens.                                               Luna: Ahh.. ahh... ahhh... *Moaning* Oh my god...                                                   Orion: (OH YES!)                                                                                    Luna: *Moaning* O-Oh g-god...                                                                       Carried away by the situation, Luna’s arm drops to her side, completely freeing her breasts. Her    legs twitch nervously.                                                                              Orion: (That's what I'm talking about...)                                                           Her shyness almost completely forgotten, Luna’s body begins to roll on the massage table.           Luna: *Moaning* Ahh... aah... ah....                                                                Orion: (My god, look at those perfectly round boobs... I need to stop myself from bending down and  just going to town on her... I’m still not sure how she’d react. I have to imagine we’re close to   her limits, considering her lack of physical contact. I just want to take her and make her mine...  But... you've gotta wait, Orion... Now’s not the proper time for it.)                               Luna: *Moaning* Agh... aah...                                                                       Orion: (Luna's whimpers of pleasure are intoxicating. I never thought I’d live to hear them...)     Luna: *Panting* AAahh... ahh... aah...                                                              Orion: You're perfect, Luna... (Fuck, my pants are about to explode. Getting into some jeans was a  bad fucking idea.)                                                                                  Luna: *Moaning* Ahh...!                                                                             Orion: (Her back is tense and stiff, but instead of moving away, she's bringing her hips towards me. I like that... Judging by her reactions to my caresses, I bet that any kind of physical touch feels way more intense to Luna. As if her whole body had sensitivity cranked to max. How I'd like to     drive her crazy with pleasure...)                                                                   Luna: Ahh... ahhhh.... *Sitting up* Aaagh...! Oh g-god...                                           Orion: Is everything okay?                                                                          Luna: *Blowing out air* No... I mean... y-yes. I mean...                                            Orion: We can stop here, if you want.                                                               Luna: No... I...                                                                                    Luna puts her hand on your chest one more time. You can see a shiver running through her body as she sighs deliriously.                                                                                 Luna: I-I can feel your heart beating. It's pounding... I... I want you to keep massaging me.       B-But... I want to feel you somewhere else...                                                       Orion: Somewhere else? Do you mean... that you want me to touch you directly?                       Luna: Y-Yes.                                                                                        Orion: (Oh my god... Did Luna Hernandez really just ask me what I think she asked me?) My Luna...   You move the thin piece of clothing to the side, revealing Luna's smooth, pink pussy. You cautiously insert one finger inside her.                                                                      Luna: AAaahhh... OH M-MY GOD. Y-You're inside.                                                      Orion: I am...                                                                                      Luna: *Hyperventilating* Ahh...                                                                     You insert both fingers inside Luna's vagina and start massaging her insides with a steady rhythm.  Luna: *Panting* Oh g-god... Aaaahh... ahhhh... aaah...                                              Orion: (Jesus... like I expected, Luna feels incredibly tight. However, her pussy’s so soaked... my fingers are sliding in, like her whole body was begging me for them.)                               Luna: *Panting* Ahhh... *Panting* T-This is... incredible...                                        As you begin to increase your pace further, Luna's whole body twists and twitches. A high-pitched   moan escapes her mouth.                                                                             Orion: (Thank god the sounds of the mountain cover up her sounds.)                                  Luna: *Panting* AAahh... aahh...                                                                    Orion: (God, it drives me insane when she looks me in the eyes. I wonder how Luna’s sensitivity to  physical touch would affect her during sex... Would it be counterproductive? Or on the contrary...  would she become insatiable?)                                                                       Luna: *Moaning* AHHH...  *Moaning* Orion... *Panting* AHHH! *Panting* W-What is going on...         Orion: (Is she gonna cum?)                                                                          Luna: *Panting* AAAahhh... I can't... *Panting* I h-h-have to... AAAAAaaaaaAaahhh....               Orion: (You did it again, Orion...)                                                                 Luna: *Recovering her breath* Ahhh... ahghh... ahh... ahhh...                                       Orion: My god, your body is unbelievably perfect, Luna...                                           Luna: *Recovering her breath* Ahhh... ahh... ahhh... *Recovering her breath* F-FUCK...              Orion: Um... excuse me?! Did you just say the “F” word?!                                            Luna: *Recovering her breath* W-What...?                                                            Orion: *Chuckles* Nothing... (It's the first time I heard her swear in the time I’ve known her. That was hot...)                                                                                        Luna: *Recovering her breath* My god... t-that was... the most intense thing I've ever felt...      Orion: That's good to hear...                                                                       Luna's hand starts to move along your torso towards your jeans.                                     Orion: (Hmm...? Is she trying to sense my body as before? Or is she... Oh my god, is this really    happening?! Is she going to...)                                                                     Mr. Hernandez: Orion! Where are you? We've gotta leave!                                             Orion: W-What? (Dammit, I completely forgot about the world for a moment.)                          Luna: . . .                                                                                         Knocked out of her trance, Luna sits up and moves away from you.                                    Orion: (Oh, fuck.) Um...                                                                            Luna: G-God! It's so late! I... I-I'm sorry, I don’t want to delay you.                             Orion: What?! Don’t worry about that! I want to be with you! I can stay and–                        Luna: No! Don't do that! You've gotta leave, and... I have things to do here too! Um... I should go and get changed. I-I'll see you Monday at school!                                                   Orion: Um... of course.                                                                             Luna: Thank you for coming, Orion.                                                                  She flees the terrace, with her breasts covered and her back turned towards you.                    Orion: (God, that was awkward. What the hell happened? Everything was perfect, and then...          Goddammit. I hope she doesn't regret what we did. I know this was a huge step for Luna.) *Sighs*    (Anyway, I guess I should go get dressed too. I just hope she's not angry. Luckily, knowing Luna,   I'm pretty sure that's not the case. Or so I hope...) *Taking a deep breath* Hmm... Alright, ready  to go. (Dammit, I was kind of expecting to see her waiting for me here. Am I really gonna leave like this...? That farewell was... cold.) . . . (Agh, I ruined a perfect day. Should I go back inside to look for her? Maybe I can fix it...)                                                               Go back inside                                                                                      Orion: (Yeah, of course I'm going back! I have to find her! I can't leave without a proper goodbye. Let's...)                                                                                           You turn around and see Luna standing in the middle of the pathway.                                 Orion: L-Luna! I-I thought you wouldn’t come to say goodbye.                                        Luna: Of course! I... I'm sorry I left like that. It's just that... I was startled.                 Orion: *Chuckles* I guess that makes sense, given the situation. I'm honestly not sure how that     escalated so fast either, but... I'm glad I had that moment with you.                               Luna: It was... amazing. And not only the massage, everything was amazing today. Thank you for      coming today, Orion. I know you probably had a thousand things more fun to do than spending a day   with me and my family, so... I appreciate it a lot.                                                 Orion: A thousand things, surely. But more fun? No way. I could spend every day with you and never  get bored.                                                                                          Luna: . . . I've never opened up to anyone about my powers, my insecurities, or my thoughts... but  with you... it's different. I... I feel safe when I'm with you. As if I could tell you anything.    Thank you for being there for me, Orion.                                                            Orion: And I'll always be there, Luna. Always.                                                      Luna: T-Text me when you get to Kredon!                                                             Orion: Will do! Will I see you Monday at school?                                                    Luna: Definitely!                                                                                   Orion: Alright then... take care, Luna. I'll miss you! *Turning around* (Well, that was definitely  be–)                                                                                                Luna grabs you by the arm with her bare hand, this time with nary a shudder.                        Orion: Huh?                                                                                         Luna: W-when we were at the pool before... And I touched you without my gloves... D-Did you try to  kiss me?                                                                                            Orion: W-What? *Nervous chuckle* I thought you didn't notice. Um... yeah, I did.                    She gets closer to you.                                                                             Orion: (And here we are again... This time, though... She doesn't even have to say anything. Her    eyes are telling me everything I need to know.)                                                     Kiss her                                                                                            You and Luna silently merge your lips into a long, lingering kiss.                                  Luna: . . .                                                                                         Orion: . . .                                                                                        Luna: *Giggles* Sorry, that was probably very clumsy.                                               Orion: It was perfect. I just hope I didn't taste like your dad's tacos.                            Luna: *Laughs* You didn't, don't worry.                                                             Orion: Now I have something to think about during my return trip.                                   Luna: I guess so... W-Well, I've gotta go! I think my grandma wants to go for a walk. I should try  to find my boots.                                                                                   Orion: Alright then... Alright then... Take care, Luna. I'll miss you!                              Luna: Me too. Have fun at tonight's party, and... tell my dad to be careful when driving. Have fun  and... tell my dad to be careful when driving!                                                      Orion: *Laughs* I will! You have fun too! (Now... THAT was a good goodbye!)                         You hear Luna go back inside, and swear you can see her doing little jumps from the corner of your  eye. Don't go back inside                                                                           Orion: (Nah... it would only make things worse. Let's go back to Kredon. I'm sure everything will be fine after a couple of days, there's no need to make it awkward. What a fucking mess.)             Mr. Hernandez: Orion! Where are you? We've gotta leave!                                             Orion: Y-YEAH! I'M COMING, SIR, SORRY! I'm ready, sir!                                              Luna's uncle: *Sobbing* I'll miss you, brother!                                                     Mr. Hernandez: Me too, hermanito!                                                                   Luna's uncle: Promise me you'll pop back for Christmas!                                             Mr. Hernandez: Don't worry, I'll come back sooner than that. And hey, I'll see you tomorrow! You    have to bring my daughter back to me!                                                               Luna's uncle: Oh... I promise nothing. We love her too much.                                        Mr. Hernandez: *Laughs* Don't make me come back!                                                    Luna's grandma: Be careful driving, Victor!                                                         Orion: Well, I'm leaving too! Ms. Hernandez, Hugo, thank you so much for inviting me to your home   today. I had a lot of fun!                                                                          Luna's uncle: My pleasure, Orion! We enjoyed having you here with us, you're a very nice lad. A man who can survive my brother's extra spicy tacos is always worthy of my respect. I'm glad you're      friends with my little niece.                                                                       Luna's grandma: And thanks again for joining the ofrenda of Luna's mother and saying a few words,   Orion. It meant a lot to me. You can come back whenever you want.                                   Orion: Thank you very much! The pleasure was all mine.                                              Mr. Hernandez: Alright, Orion, are you ready?                                                       Orion: Ready!                                                                                       Mr. Hernandez: Then get in the car! Fiero will take us back to Kredon in 5 hours! Or maybe even     less!                                                                                               Orion: *Gulps* A-Alright. (Ah, home sweet home! Hmm... there's still an hour left until the party   starts. I still can't believe Mr. Hernandez managed to arrive on time. That man sure knows the road! It felt good to hit the gym again. Taking a couple of days off Eternum was the right call. I don't wanna start suffering from those hallucinations in real life that those Eternum addicts get...      Tonight's the party at Penelope's university. I guess she must have left already. That will probably be tons of fun... but I don't even have a costume, so I wouldn't have been able to go. Though, it’s not like I was even invited in the first place. Well, maybe next year. I'll go to sleep early      tonight. I'm supposed to go with Nancy to her office tomorrow morning anyway. I'll show her what I'm capable of! I think I received some messages earlier... I wish I could play with them! I'm sure the two of them make a great team. Let's see what else...) *Chuckles* (So she spent the afternoon here? That's pretty nice. I'm glad to see Nova becoming friends with Penny, Dalia and Nancy. Oh! I got a response from Annie too.) Hmm... (I can't really wait for her for too long, though. I've gotta– Oh  boy, that photo was sexy as hell. I'm saving that to my private gallery. And... well, that was all. Alright, let's go inside. The shower is calling me... Anyway... I hope Nova doesn't take too long.  Meh, I guess I was just imagining things. My mind must have been playing tricks on me. Alright,     let's go inside. The shower is calling me... Hmm... Anyway, I hope Nova doesn't take too long. I    can't really wait for her much lo– Chang hasn't answered yet. He read my message, though. That      sneaky bastard must be too busy thinking about how to make Micaela fall in love with him. I probably shouldn’t bother him with my bullshit. Alright, let's go inside. The shower is calling me... I hope Nova doesn't take too long. I can't really wait for her much lo– And... oh. It was just a spam     email about a new crypto platform. Really? That's all I got in 6 hours? I guess I'm not the most    popular guy in Kredon... Bah, who cares. I've got a costume party waiting for me! But first of      all... I should take a shower. I can even smell myself...)                                          Nova: HI!                                                                                           Orion: Gggh! . . . You'll never change, will you?                                                   Nova: *Giggles* Hey, you didn't scream this time! Just a little gasp.                               Orion: I must be getting used to your sneak attacks.                                                Nova: I’ll have to up my game!                                                                      Orion: Shouldn't you be dressed by now? The party will begin shortly.                               Nova: No worries! I left everything I need in my room and my mom will do my hair. It won't take me  more than 30 minutes!                                                                               Orion: Ah, I see you've got it covered! Alright girly, what do you need from me, then? Why did you  come back? Well... what do you need? I just got back and honestly, I'm a little exhausted.          Nova: I finished what I was drawing!                                                                Orion: OH! Awesome!                                                                                 Nova: I came to see Penelope and I brought this with me in case you were here. Do you wanna see it? Orion: Of course!                                                                                   Nova opens her folder with shaky hands, and gives you two sheets of paper.                          Orion: Hmm? Holy shit, that's... a manga comic! And... wait. Is that...                             Nova: *Clears throat* Ahem!                                                                         She starts imitating Thanatos' voice, trying to sound somber and intimidating.                      Nova: Soon, the ten Gems will be mine... nAnd I will rule over a sea of blood!                      Orion: *Laughs* You nailed him!                                                                     Nova: BANGGGG!!!                                                                                    She imitates the sound of a shot with her mouth.                                                    Nova: It's over, Thanatos! You are no match for Delilah Warren and Dione!                           Orion: *Laughs* Damn! I love anime Nova!                                                            Nova: *Giggles* Thanks!                                                                             Orion: Why is she holding the rifle like that, though?                                              Nova: DON'T INTERRUPT! CLACKKK!                                                                     Nova makes a metallic sound with her mouth you can't identify.                                      Orion: . . .                                                                                        Nova: She's reloading the magazine!                                                                 Orion: Ohhh!                                                                                        Nova: WHOOSH!!! *Gasps* He's so fast! You PATHETIC creature! *Gasps in her normal tone of voice*    Orion: *Chuckles* (I love how much passion and nenthusiasm she's putting into her narration.)       Nova: I will kill you, just as I killed hi- BAMMMM!!! AAAAARGH!!! The only fate of the weak... is to be crushed by the strong. KNOW YOUR PLACE, DEMON. Nothing personal, demon. JUST TAKING OUT THE     TRASH. You sealed your fate the moment you put your filthy hands on her, demon. GO TO HELL...       AGAIN.                                                                                              Orion: DAMN! That's my line!                                                                        Nova: *Giggles* Yes!                                                                                Orion: This last panel looks so cool! (Hmm... am I crazy or did she draw herself with bigger boobs?) Your anime self even has the same mole on your chest!                                              Nova: W-What? *Nervous laugh* O-Oh, yeah...! I wanted it to be accurate, y'know. I d-didn't think   you'd remember that...                                                                              Orion: (Hard to forget...)                                                                          You look back at Nova, who stands in front of you eagerly waiting for your final reaction. It's not my thing, but...                                                                                    Orion: Well, it's not really my thing, but... I can tell that you've worked hard on this!           It looks a little amateurish                                                                        Orion: It was a good first try, definitely shows a lot of promise. But I think your strokes here    look a little amateurish. You might want to look it over!                                           I just love it                                                                                      Orion: I just love it. Uh... Nova?                                                                  Nova: . . .                                                                                         Orion: I-I mean... It's awesome! I didn't word it well! Um... I just meant that...                  Nova: N-No worries! I know what you mean. I... We can't be good at everything. I shouldn’t waste    your time on stupid shit like this. I should focus on hacking so we can find the Gems.              Orion: That's not what I meant!                                                                     Nova: I know! I... uh... I'm sorry, this nerdy nonsense is probably so dumb to you. We should get   ready for that party, eh? I just hope my ridiculous costume isn't too ridiculous... haha...ha!      Orion: Come on, Nova, I'm sure it's amazing!                                                        Nova: Yeah... Anyway, I'll just take my drawings back home. Thanks for your feedback.               Orion: (Dammit... I can't help but feel bad now. Really put my foot in my mouth.)                   Nova: Alright! I'll meet you and Penelope in a few minutes! See ya!                                 Orion: Are you sure you're okay...?                                                                 Nova: Yeah! No worries. It's alright. Bye Orion!                                                    Orion: (Damn, she’s so sensitive to criticism. I feel kinda bad, but maybe it will be good for her  in the long term. And knowing Nova, I'm sure she'll get over it in just a few minutes. Or so I      hope.)                                                                                              Nova: R-Really?? Do you like it?                                                                    Orion: Seriously, I love it! You aced the characters. I can't believe you were able to draw Thanatos so accurately just after seeing him once.                                                          Nova: T-Thank you! I have a good memory. And I've always loved manga, so... I thought I’d try it    out. And I know you’re into this stuff too, so...                                                   Orion: You're just full of surprises, miss. And I really like how my anime self looks!              Nova: Oh... you mean the guy who rescues the girl from Thanatos? It's just a random hero.           Orion: A random hero...?                                                                            Nova: Uh... yeah. It's not supposed to be anyone in particular.                                     Orion: I mean, he has my hairstyle and hair color, green eyes, skin, he says my quote...            Nova: Well, I might have been inspired by people I know. An amalgam of the coolest guys I know.     Orion: *Chuckles* Ah, yeah, that makes sense. Well, in any case... can I keep it? Even if the hero  of the manga is totally not me?                                                                     Nova: Yes, you can! I'm glad you liked it!                                                          Orion: Well, we should start getting ready, don't you think?                                        Nova: Yes, you're right! I'll see you and Penny soon. Well, I gotta go! I'll see you tomorrow,      Orion!                                                                                              Orion: Sure! Thanks again for the manga!                                                            Nova: *Giggles* You're welcome, you're welcome! Bye!                                                Orion: *Chuckles* (Well, this was unexpected. Not everyone gives gifts without a reason like she    did. And I really meant it, she nailed it! I can tell that she spent dozens of hours drawing this. I should think about something to give back as a gift. Probably not another manga, it would look like something drawn by a five-year-old... But anyway, it's time to get ready. I’m making my college    debut tonight! Gotta impress all those university girls... Especially one or two in particular...   Especially one in particular...) *Yawns* (Anyway, I guess I should get inside. I think all the girls are out today, and Penelope is going to that party of hers shortly, so... I’ve got the whole house to myself. Just me, a TV, and a bag of chips.) *Sigh* (Living the dream, Orion! Ahh... a hot shower really does wonders. I needed this so much. Especially with the night I have ahead of me. I'm not   sure how wild these college parties are, but I doubt we'll be going to sleep early tonight. I'm sure it will be fun regardless, though. I can't wait to see Penny and Nova's costumes! I can't wait to  see Penny's costume!)                                                                               Penelope: *Knocks on the door* Orion? Is that you?                                                  Orion: (Ah, speak of the devil...) Yep! Sorry, I'm almost done. Give me 5 minutes.                  Penelope: No, no, I took a shower already! I just need to grab a couple of bottles from the cabinet real quick. Can I come in?                                                                          Yes                                                                                                 Orion: Um... sure. No problem.                                                                      Penelope: Thanks! I won't look, I promise.                                                          Orion: *Chuckles* It's okay. I’m not too shy about my body... I’ve got nothing to hide!             Penelope: Alright then... good to know. *Grabbing some bottles from the closet* I guess we have that in common. I’m perfectly fine with showing off my body too.                                        Orion: Y-Yeah. (Jesus, she's not even wearing a bra. Look at those huge tits... They’re basically   defying gravity. My god. Staring at these while I’m in the shower is probably a bad idea. I should  probably stop before she turns around and catches me with a boner.) *Clears throat* So... are you   planning to drink a lot tonight?                                                                    Penelope: *Giggles* I don't know... are you?                                                        Orion: Me? I'm gonna set some drinking records tonight!                                             Penelope: *Giggles* Just make sure not to pass out too early... I don't think I could carry you back home. You’re pretty... big.                                                                        Orion: *Chuckles* Don't worry, I know how to cont– *Turning around* T-To control...                 Penelope: *Looking at the shower shelves* Hey, is my conditioner in here? I thought I left it in the closet, but I didn't see it.                                                                       Orion: W-What?                                                                                      Penelope: My conditioner. For my hair. I need a very specific hairstyle for my costume, and I need  to nail it.                                                                                         Orion: Um... I-Is it the orange bottle? I think I saw it in the downstairs bathroom.                Penelope: Oh! Okay, cool. Thanks!                                                                   Orion: Y-You're welcome.                                                                            Penelope: *Chuckles* Are you alright?                                                               Orion: Y-Yeah... *clears throat* I mean, yeah.                                                      Penelope: I thought you said you didn't mind me coming in. That you weren't a shy person.           Orion: And I'm not! I'm totally cool with it. It’s just that... um... the steam from the shower     might mess up your hair. Might make your hairstyle all frizzy before the party, y'know.             Penelope: I see... Cool. Thanks for the concern. Anyway, now that we’ve both seen each other naked, there's really no reason to make a big deal about this in the future.                               Orion: Does that mean that I can enter the bathroom while you're taking a shower too...?            Penelope: Of course. As long as you have an urgent and compelling reason to barge into the bathroom while I’m wet and naked in the shower, of course...                                                 Orion: As urgent as hair conditioner, got it... That makes sense. (Good to know...)                 Penelope: Anyway, I have what I need. I'll go start getting dressed.                                Orion: S-Sure! I'll do the same. See you outside.                                                   Penelope: . . .                                                                                     Fully aware of your gaze on her, Penelope shifts her eyes downwards and stares directly at your bare penis.                                                                                             Penelope: . . .                                                                                     Orion: (Oh god. This should be an awkward situation, but those fuck me eyes are turning me on so    much... I think my cock just twitched. Please don't get hard now, she'll think I'm just a horny     fucking kid... W-Why isn't she saying anything, though? I-Is she smirking? W-What is going on?! Is  she trying to make me feel uncomfortable or is she...?) Uh... See anything interesting, Penny? D-Do you need anything else from the shower?                                                             Penelope: Yeah, I'll let you finish your shower, sorry. Didn’t mean to give you a hard time. We have to leave in 20 minutes, so don't take too long.                                                    Orion: S-Sure! I'll be ready in 10.                                                                 Penelope: See you outside...                                                                        Orion: (Penelope Carter... you’re gonna drive me mad. I was already looking forward to this party,  but after that... I should start getting dressed, I CAN'T be late! Let's BLOW UP that party!)       No                                                                                                  Orion: I'm almost done, just wait a couple of minutes, please. What do you need?                    Penelope: Just some hairspray. But it's okay, I'll grab it before leaving, no big deal. Don't take  too long, though! We have to leave in 20 minutes.                                                   Orion: Noted! (Aw, man, I could stay in here for hours. She's right, though, I should start getting dressed. I don't want her to be late because of me.) . . . (Just 15 seconds more... As fast as      Hermes... As strong as Heracles... And as wise as ATHENA! I am...) Hmm? (Dammit, I was just getting into the role.) *Turning the lights on* (Oh, it's Nova. Alright, let's not keep her waiting, then.) *Turning the lights on* (Agh, goddammit, it's just spam. I have to unsubscribe from this channel.   But I'll do it later. Time to go!) Penny? I'm ready! You all set?                                   Carolyn: *Meows*                                                                                    You look down and notice Carolyn staring at you with begging eyes.                                  Orion: Hey there, pretty lady! What's the matter? Did the girls forget about feeding you? Is that   it?                                                                                                 Carolyn: *Purring*                                                                                  Orion: Is that so?! How dare they!                                                                  Penelope: *Laughs* Don't let her fool you! She already had her dinner! If she had her way, she'd    never stop eating. Dalia and her are two peas in a pod.                                             Orion: Oh... my... GOD! Did I log into Eternum and forget?! I have the Lady of Eternum right in     front of me!                                                                                        Penelope: *Giggles* Do you like it?                                                                 Orion: I love it! You look spectacular, Penny. Really hit it out of the park! You somehow look      better than Idriel does... in her own costume!                                                      Penelope: Thank you! I thought it was appropriate, now that I'm an “Eternumite” too.                Orion: It's amazing! Was it hard to find? Or expensive?                                             Penelope: Not at all! A brand contacted me on Instagram to sponsor me and send me the outfit, so I  didn't pay anything. I just have to mention them in my next post. It’s a little tight in the bust   though, these brand sponsors always think I’m exaggerating my breast size... I thought of dying my  hair too for a perfect cosplay, but... I didn't want to risk it. A lot of things can go wrong, and  my hair is the most valuable asset in my modeling career!                                           Orion: Well... I wouldn't say the most valuable...                                                  Penelope: *Giggles* Don't be dirty!                                                                 Orion: *Chuckles* Seriously, though, you nailed it. Can you see anything with that blindfold,       though?                                                                                             Penelope: *Removing the blindfold* Yeah, I can. Although I'd rather not be wearing it all the time. I have to keep it on while taking pictures, though!                                                 Orion: For sure! Idriel wouldn’t be Idriel without her blindfold.                                   Penelope: Well... now tell me, what are you supposed to be?                                         Orion: Ah... I'm Eros! The Greek god of love and desire.                                            Penelope: Oh my... God of love and desire, huh? Are you planning to enchant anyone with your bow    tonight?                                                                                            Orion: We'll see, we'll see... I've gotta be careful, with great power comes great responsibility.  Penelope: Of course... Isn't Eros supposed to have wings, though?                                   Orion: Yeah... but they weren't included with the costume. *Chuckles* Don't expose me though! Not   everyone is an expert on mythology like you.                                                        Penelope: Nah, I'm no expert. Wings, a bow, son of Aphrodite and Ares, and husband of Psyche. That's all I know.                                                                                        Orion: Curious that you mentioned that, that's how I got the idea. Someone at that dinner where I   met the Founder told me about Psyche, and that made me think about it as a costume.                 Penelope: *Putting her blindfold back on* Well, I can tell it was a great idea, Eros. You look      great!                                                                                              Orion: Thank you!                                                                                   Penelope: It's too bad I couldn't dress up as Psyche. You know... so we could match.                Orion: (Oh boy... She’s really laying the flirt on tonight... If she's trying to provoke me, she's  definitely succeeding.) Yeah, that's too bad... Maybe next year?                                    Penelope: For sure. Maybe next year. Shall we go... Eros?                                           Orion: With pleasure... Idriel. Alright, here we are! This is the place, isn't it?                  Penelope: Yep. Nova sent me a message a few minutes ago saying she was on her way.                  Orion: Yeah, me too. She must be about to arrive, then. Is the uni building far from here?          Penelope: Nope, just a 7 or 8-minute walk. It's right behind those apartments.                      Orion: Are all those student flats?                                                                 Penelope: Yeah! All the students from outside Kredon have to live there.                            Orion: That's where I'll be living next year if I can get into this college, I guess.               Penelope: *Chuckles* Don’t be silly! You're staying with us until we say so. No escaping the        Carters!                                                                                            Orion: *Chuckles* I was hoping you'd say that, not gonna lie. Ouch. (What the hell was that? Did    someone throw a ball at me?) *Turning around* What the fuck... I'm sorry, can I help yo– Wait a     second... Nova?!                                                                                    Nova: Bang! Headshot!                                                                               Orion: Holy shit, that's really you!                                                                Nova: TA-DA!                                                                                        Orion: Wow, you look unrecognizable! You nailed your costume! Damn, I don't think I’d be able to    tell it was you if it wasn’t for your eyes.                                                         Penelope: WOW! We bought the outfit together, but I hadn't seen her with her hair done yet... Nova, you look incredible!                                                                                Nova: *Giggles* Thank you, thank you!                                                               Penelope: This costume was made for you!                                                            Nova: *Giggles* Thank you!                                                                          Orion: *Laughs* You look so different, but your reaction to praise gives you away, Nova.            Nova: You look great too, guys!                                                                     Orion: Thanks!                                                                                      Nova: Are you supposed to be “Orion”, Orion? The Greek huntsman hero?                               Orion: No! I'm... Wait, Orion was so much better. (What the hell, why didn't I think of that...?)   Um... Well, I'm supposed to be Eros. I'm supposed to be Eros.                                       Nova: Who...?                                                                                       Orion: Greek god. Son of Aphrodite and Ares, super cool god.                                        Nova: Uh... okay, if you say so.                                                                    Orion: Uh... he has a bow too. Go on, tell her Penny!                                               Penelope: He’s Cupid, Nova.                                                                         Nova: What? But I thought Cupid was just a fat baby with wings and some arrows?                     Penelope: Yeah... but that wouldn’t give Orion an excuse to dress up as a hot, half-naked model, eh?Nova: Ah, I understand it now!                                                                      Orion: *Laughs* Whatever, it's just something I bought online. Yours look much more elaborate!      Nova: Thanks! I've always loved Jinx and I've been wanting to cosplay her for a while. But I never  had any... party or event where I got the chance to do so. ...until now!                            Orion: Where did you buy it? Or is it handmade?                                                     Nova: Bit of both. Penny and my mom helped me with everything. I tried to be as accurate as         possible! I even dyed my hair with a special blue powder. It should disappear after washing it with shampoo.                                                                                            Orion: What about your eye, though?                                                                 Nova: It's okay, I've got it under control. The sun has already set, and since I've had it covered  for two days straight, I should be able to hold out for 5 or 6 hours, which is the time we'll be    there... more or less. Worst case scenario, I have an eye patch in case it starts hurting me. See?  Orion: Hmm... well, okay, okay, just make sure not to push it, okay?                                Nova: For sure! Don't worry.                                                                        Orion: Alright, girls... Now that everyone is here... Let's party!                                  Nova: Hell yeah!                                                                                    Penelope: Can you take a pic of us before going in, Orion? I haven't posted anything today yet.     Orion: Sure!                                                                                        Nova: W-What? Am I gonna be on your Instagram profile? With you?                                    Penelope: Yeah!                                                                                     Nova: Oh my god.                                                                                    Orion: Come on, Nova, look at the camera! Or we're gonna miss the good stuff!                       Nova: Y-Yeah!                                                                                       Orion: I'm finally here! A college party, baby! And before I’ve attended a single class!            Penelope: *Chuckles* You're too excited, Orion. If you think this is going to be like American Pie, you'll be disappointed.                                                                             Orion: Hey, there's a passed out Power Ranger next to a bottle of vodka by the entrance. That's     promising.                                                                                          Penelope: *Laughs* Fair enough.                                                                     Orion: In any case, I'm sure it'll be fun. I mean, as long as you two are here, I can't ask for     more! I mean, as long as you're here, I can't ask for more!                                         Penelope: The music's very loud, isn't it?                                                          Orion: That's one of the advantages of having a building with no neighbors, I guess. Nobody can     complain!                                                                                           Nova: And they do this every year? It looks amazing.                                                Orion: Is it the first time you’ve come, Nova?                                                      Nova: Yeah...                                                                                       Penelope: They do it every year for Halloween, yeah.                                                Nova: Cool... Yesterday this place looked nothing like this. Everything seems much more... boring on a normal day.                                                                                      Penelope: Alright... I think I see Judith at the counter. You should ask her before going in, she's the main organizer for all the events.                                                              Orion: On it!                                                                                       You approach the counter and wait for the girl to notice you.                                       Penelope: Orion looks pretty good in his costume too, don't you think?                              Nova: Yeah!                                                                                         Penelope: It makes him look very fit.                                                               Nova: I thought the same thing!                                                                     Penelope: Yeah... You know... *Giggles* Can I tell you a secret, Nova?                              Nova: O-Of course! My mind is a steel trap.                                                         Penelope: But you've gotta promise me you won't tell anyone.                                        Nova: I'd never! My lips are sealed.                                                                Penelope: Okay... *Giggles* I... I think... I might have a little crush on Orion.                   Nova: Y-You... what?!                                                                               Penelope: Isn't it crazy?! I've never been attracted to guys younger than me, but I don't know...   he's really cute!                                                                                   Nova: U-Uh... a-are you sure?                                                                       Penelope: I think so! I thought it was just a temporary thing, but... shit, I don't know anymore. I mean, I saw him naked in the shower earlier today and holy fuck, girl. You have no idea how much    that turned me on...                                                                                Nova: N-Naked?                                                                                      Penelope: *Giggles* I feel like I'm 15 again! But he might not be into me like that so... keep it   secret!                                                                                             Nova: O-Of course!                                                                                  Penelope: I just needed to tell this to someone so much! It feels great to have a bestie I can tell stuff like this to. But anyway, let's link back up with him. *Giggles* He'll probably think we're   conspiring together or something.                                                                   Nova: Y-yeah, and we're not. . . . (Oh my god. Penelope told me a secret. A BIG one!) *Giggles* (And she called me her “bestie”! I'm the confidant of the most popular girl in college. Me! But holy    shit, did she say she has a crush on Orion too?! That's... Wait... “too”? I don't have a crush on   Orion. Yeah, he's cute, he's funny, he likes what I like, he has a great body, he’s super kind, he's a badass in Eternum... And... well, did I spend more than a week drawing a manga for him? Yes, I   did, okay. But that doesn't mean anything. We're just friends. Friends. Do I like being with him? I mean, yeah, sure. Was what happened in the Egyptian server kinda hot when it should have been scary? Maybe. Do I think of him when I'm alone? Yeah, sometimes. A lot of times. Most of the time. BUT,   would I like to have something with him?) . . . (Oh my god, I WOULD. I have a crush on Orion. When  did this happen?! What am I supposed to do now?! Okay, there's no need to panic, Nova. Just act as  suave as usual. Nothing happened. So what if my new bestie Penny and I have a crush on the same     boy?)                                                                                               Orion: NOVA!!!                                                                                      Nova: I KNOW N-NOTHING I SWEAR SHE DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING IT'S A SECRET I CAN'T TELL!              Orion: What?                                                                                        Nova: . . . Erm... I mean, y-yeah, sure, I'm coming! S-Sorry, I was distracted.                     Judith: Oh, and tell Costa that the pool is closed! I can't have a rerun of last year!              Orion: Hi there!                                                                                    Judith: Oh, hi. Welcome to the University of Kredon's Annual Halloween Party.                       Orion: Thanks! Can we go in?                                                                        Judith: Of course, after paying the $49 fee.                                                        Orion: What?! Really? I thought it was free.                                                        Judith: It is, for college students. But as you can imagine, we can't let every random dude from the town come scrounging. It's an open bar, and there’s free food. Charging $49 is little less than an outright gift.                                                                                      Orion: Agh, I guess you're right.                                                                   Judith: And speaking of college students, it's so nice to see you here, Penelope. You look          spectacular!                                                                                        Penelope: Thank you, Judith! You know I wouldn't miss a party organized by you.                     Judith: Ah, you’re too kind!                                                                        Penelope: I'll pay the fee too. I know how much work it involves every year.                        Judith: Nonsense. You don't have to pay a cent. You're the star of this show!                       Penelope: *Chuckles* I wouldn't say that, but alright, thank you so much!                           Judith: You're very welcome. You have to pay, though. We accept dollars and eternals. Wallet number E-0XA5096F333.                                                                                      Orion: Okay, okay... (Fuck, my account is overdrawn. If I don't solve this soon, Ulysses will deny  me access to Eternum. I've gotta be careful.) I just sent you the money. I hope it's worth it!      Judith: Hmm... Got it. Thank you for your contribution. Enjoy the party!                            Orion: I plan to!                                                                                   Judith: And now you, baby. Pony up.                                                                 Nova: *Giggles* I understand the confusion, I guess I do look pretty much unrecognizable. I'm Nova! Judith: . . .                                                                                       Nova: . . . ...Nova Johnson.                                                                        Judith: . . . Uh... it doesn't ring a bell.                                                         Nova: Why the hell does no one ever remember me?! I'm a natural ginger. Long, curly hair. I wear an eye patch during the day!                                                                           Judith: . . . Are you over 18?                                                                      Nova: Oh, come on, Judith, we're taking 3 classes together!                                         Judith: . . .                                                                                       Nova: . . . ...I'm the one who slipped and fell down in the cafeteria 4 days ago.                   Judith: . . . *Laughs* AAAAH! I remember you! *Laughs* All your pencils flew away and the cupcake   landed on top of your laptop! That was hysterical!                                                  Nova: That is one seriously selective memory.                                                       Judith: *Laughs* Okay, okay, you can all pass. Enjoy the party, guys.                               Orion: *Chuckles* Thanks.                                                                           Penelope: Alright, we're all set! You ready?                                                        Orion: Absolutely!                                                                                  Penelope: Follow me! I want to introduce you to Lily and Marco. They're my friends from journalism  class.                                                                                              Orion: Sure thing!                                                                                  Nova: Ah, YEAH! I want to introduce you to all my friends too, Orion. There's... eh... John... Um... Nobara... Uh... Annie...                                                                           Orion: Annie? Our Annie?                                                                            Nova: No, not our Annie. Another one. Annie... Summers. Annie Summers.                              Orion: Can't wait to meet them all!                                                                 Nova: W-Well, we'll see. Maybe they didn't come. They're not party people.                          Orion: *Chuckles* I see.                                                                            College Student: Oh my GOD! Your Idriel costume is amazing, Penelope!                               Penelope: Oh, thank you!                                                                            College Student: And look at those giant bags of milk! They're magnificent!                         Penelope: Um...                                                                                     Orion: What?                                                                                        Penelope: Thanks, I guess?                                                                          College Student: Can I take a photo of you?                                                         Penelope: Sure, no prob-                                                                            College Student: *Grabbing her* SHE SAID YES! Come with me!                                         Penelope: W-What?!                                                                                  College Student: There's no good lighting here!                                                     Penelope: Orion! H-Help! SAVE MEEE!                                                                 The girl drags Penelope away.                                                                       Orion: W-What the hell just happened?                                                               Nova: WHAT?! A brand new Intel Xeon Dragon X?                                                       College Student: Yeah, so they said.                                                                Nova: And I just have to win a game?                                                                College Student: Yep, in pairs. But if you're interested, you should join ASAP. I think there's only one spot left to participate. Turn left and go to the cafeteria, then ask for Akira-san.           Nova: O-Okay, thank you! Did you hear that, Orion?! A brand new Intel Xeon Dragon X!                Orion: A what?                                                                                      Nova: The best CPU on the market! That thing alone costs more than $4000!                           Orion: Holy shit. That's almost 2 neural implants.                                                  Nova: Do you know the things I could do with one of those, Orion?! I NEED it!                       Orion: And they're giving it away?                                                                  Nova: It's the prize for winning a game! In pairs! You've gotta help me!                            Orion: You can count on me! Although, maybe we're late. That guy said they-                         Nova: FUCK NO! This game is the reason I’m here tonight! It’s my destiny! We can't lose!            Orion: B-But you didn't even know about it 3 minutes ag-                                            Nova: I'll run to get a spot! I'll wait for you there!                                              Orion: B-But-                                                                                       Nova starts running and disappears into the crowd.                                                  Orion: What the hell is happening...?                                                               Judith: *Laughs* They've left you all alone.                                                        Orion: Very funny... I’m happy my predicament is at least giving someone pleasure.                  Judith: It seems like you’ll be in for a fun night!                                                 Orion: You have no idea.                                                                            Judith: Alright, grab a drink and have some fun. If you need any directions, I'll be here.          Orion: Thanks! (Okay, so... Nova to the left, Penelope to the right. Hmm. That crazy girl took      Penelope to the right. This promises to be a bumpy night. I should grab a drink...) I should ask at the counter before going anywhere. (Hmm, I've seen a lot of people cosplaying anime characters. Nova would have enjoyed this... Hmm, Nova isn't back yet. I guess she must be with Akira getting the    prize.)                                                                                             Nova: Of course I study here! Computer Science!                                                     Orion: Sup!                                                                                         Nova: Ah! Hi Orion! This is my partner for the game!                                                Orion: Hi! You must be Akira.                                                                       Akira-san: Akira-san to you! You've gotta show some respect, boy.                                   Orion: Um... that's gonna be kind of a challenge given that you're not even wearing pants, but      sure... Akira-san. I heard you're running a game.                                                   Akira-san: That's correct. And the prize is no small reward! An almost brand new Intel Xeon Dragon  X, the best CPU on the market.                                                                      Orion: Why are you giving it away?                                                                  Akira-san: I'm a robotics and hardware engineer. I created my own processing unit, faster and better than any other in the world. So I decided to give away my old CPU, since it's of no use to me      anymore.                                                                                            Orion: Wow, that's actually very generous of you.                                                   Akira-san: It's not about generosity. The winners must prove their value! Only a truly worthy pair  deserves the victory. A piece of hardware like this must be in the hands of outstanding students.   Orion: That would be us!                                                                            Nova: We're super worthy!                                                                           Akira-san: You'll have to prove that... You must answer a question before I allow you to            participate. You know, as a filter.                                                                 Orion: Shoot.                                                                                       Akira-san: Straight to the point, eh...? I like it. Alright... What is packaging a microprocessor,  and what are the different types of packaging available?                                            Orion: Uhhh... (Fuck.) That's when you package the...                                               Nova: Packaging is the process of connecting a microprocessor with a computer's motherboard. The    types of microprocessor packaging are PGA, SPGA, SECC, and LGA.                                     Orion: Ah, that's just what I was about to say!                                                     Akira-san: Well, well, well... Finally, someone who knows what she’s talking about. Very well, girl! Haskel, Dolores, you have your rivals!                                                             Haskel: I was kind of hoping to get that CPU without playing the game, but beating you will be even better.                                                                                             Orion: Nice to meet you. There are no other contestants?                                            Dolores: They tried, but no one passed Akira's filter. It was funny seeing them get all of his      questions wrong.                                                                                    Orion: Well, I'm sorry to spoil the party, but you'll have no luck tonight. We're taking that CPU   home. Right, Nova?                                                                                  Nova: Hell yeah!                                                                                    Haskel: We'll see about that. There's no way on earth we're losing to two freshman rookies.         Nova: What do you mean, freshman? I'm in my third year!                                             Orion: Hah! We'll make you eat your words.                                                          Akira-san: The game is simple. 90 minutes. 5 challenges. You'll be competing against Haskel and     Dolores. The team with the most points after completing all 5 challenges is the winner!             Orion: Got it!                                                                                      Akira-san: Are you ready to begin?                                                                  Ready                                                                                               Orion: We're ready!                                                                                 Not yet                                                                                             Orion: Not yet. I want to have a look around first.                                                 Akira-san: I'll be here. Just don't rest on your laurels. I can't save your spot forever.           Orion: Gotcha.                                                                                      Nova: Whaaaat?                                                                                      Orion: I just want to go and check on Penny. I'll tell her we're here, so she doesn't worry.        Nova: Oh... okay. But don't take too long, please! There's only one spot left!                      Orion: I won't, I promise! I'll be right back.                                                      Akira-san: Welcome back! Are you ready to begin?                                                    Ready                                                                                               Orion: We're ready!                                                                                 Not yet                                                                                             Orion: Not yet.                                                                                     Akira-san: I'll be here. Excellent. Let's get started, then! This is our first challenge, ladies and gentlemen. I like to call it... The drinking.                                                      Nova: What do we have to do?                                                                        Akira-san: Simple. The team who can drink more beer in 10 minutes gets the point!                   Orion: *Chuckles* Really? I thought your “challenges” would be more... computer-related.            Akira-san: There are two things I know something about in this life, Orion. Computers and parties.  My winner must demonstrate being the king of both!                                                  Haskel: Scared of a little drinking, Orion? You need to be home before 12?                          Orion: Shut up, horseface! I'll knock you out! Alright, how are your drinking skills, Nova?         Nova: Uhh... they're probably not the best. I never drink.                                          Orion: Okay... well, don't worry. I got you. Just do what you can. Me and my fast metabolism will do the rest. We're winning this!                                                                      Nova: Hell yes! Thank you for helping me, Orion.                                                    Orion: Hey, a game where I get to drink free beer? I'd do this every week! Now let's show them who  they're dealing with!                                                                               Nova: YEAH! Oof... *Hiccup* Hic! I'm really, really drunk, Orion. I'm not sure I can... d-drink     anymore.                                                                                            Orion: W-What are you talking about? You didn't even finish your first one!                         Nova: But I w-weigh like 100 pounds! I can't- *Hiccup* Hic! I don't have your t-tolerance! With all your height, and your muscles, and your big... arms... and... *Hiccup* Hic! And legs...             Orion: I think we're... *Hiccup* Hic! ...we're fucked. D-Dammit, now you've given me hiccups too.   Haskel: Do you surrender? There's only 1 minute left and we're 2 beers ahead.                       Orion: N-No way! I can drink more!                                                                  You finish your 5th beer in less than 10 minutes.                                                   Orion: (God, the worst part is having to drink them all so fast. And I'd never seen this beer, but  I'm pretty sure it has a higher amount of alcohol than usual. Maybe I shouldn't drink anymore if I  don't want to end the night early. But I don't want to let Nova down either...)                     Drink another one                                                                                   Orion: *Drinking another one* (Bah, fuck it. Six! And I'm fine! Better than fine. I've never been   finer. Hey... Who's spinning the table...?)                                                         You fall to the ground like a cut down tree.                                                        Nova: Orion!                                                                                        Orion: MMmMm...                                                                                     Nova: Orion!                                                                                        Orion: Hmm... Oh shit, what happened? Nova? Oh fuck, did I pass out?                                Nova: Yeah... you've been sleeping for the past 30 minutes. Those two bastards won the CPU...       Orion: Oh... really?! Fuck, I'm sorry, Nova.                                                        Nova: Don't worry, it was my fault. It's me who couldn't even drink one- *Gagging* Hmm!             Orion: Are you okay?                                                                                Nova: Y-Yeah, I just need to go to the bathroom. It's just that anxiety makes me want to throw up.  And combined with alcohol, even more. And when I saw you falling I worried and... *Gagging* Hmm!    Nova runs out of the cafeteria.                                                                     Orion: (Man, I'm sorry for her. What a mess. I wonder what other challenges Akira prepared... Well, I can't go back in time. What's done is done. Let's go see what Penelope is doing...)               Stop here                                                                                           Orion: . . .                                                                                        Dolores: Are you gonna drink or not?                                                                Orion: . . . ...Maybe not. We should stop here, Nova. Think about it, if we're not drunk, we'll do  better in the other challenges.                                                                     Nova: Ahhh! Very cle- *Hiccup* Hic! Very clever!                                                    Akira-san: That settles it, then! Haskel and Dolores win the first point!                           Haskel: Piece of cake!                                                                              Nova: We're just giving them a free head start.                                                     Akira-san: Alright guys, it is time for our second challenge! I call it... The hunt.                Nova: What are we hunting?                                                                          Akira-san: Simple. The team who can bring me the bra with a larger cup size, wins!                  Orion: A bra?                                                                                       Nova: And what are you going to do with it, you old pervert?                                        Akira-san: Nothing. It's just for science! You have another 10 minutes. The time starts... now!     Dolores: *Standing up* Can we give you our own? Is that allowed?                                    Akira-san: Good question, my lovely Dolores. Yes, it is allowed. Just remember, the biggest one when the time runs out gets the point!                                                                  Dolores: *Giggles* I see. *Giggles* In that case we start with a great advantage.                   Nova: Huh? What do you mean by t...? . . . Grrr... “In tHaT cAsE wE sTaRt wIth a gReaT aDvAnTagE...” Ha, ha.                                                                                            Orion: Don't worry, Nova, we got this! We have an unbeatable trump card to play here.               Nova: We have to find Penny!                                                                        Orion: Yes! I'll go get her! Do you have a plan B? She wasn't wearing a bra because of her costume, so maybe she doesn't have one here. I mean... I-I think so. I'm not sure. I didn't look that        closely.                                                                                            Nova: Oh, I did! She wasn't wearing a bra. The only thing holding her big boobas was the net of     Idriel's dress. I'll go ask around in case she doesn't have one here.                               Orion: Okay! I'll see you back here in 10 minutes!                                                  Nova: Gotcha! Good luck!                                                                            Akira-san: Ah, Orion! Just in time.                                                                 Nova: I couldn't find anything, I'm sorry. What about you? Any luck?                                Orion: Yes! I got it!                                                                               Nova: Ah, sweet! I knew Penny wouldn't let us down!                                                 Akira-san: Okay gentlemen... show me your hunt.                                                     Nova: All yours.                                                                                    You hand Penelope's bra to Akira.                                                                   Akira-san: MY GOD... Enormous cup size, but a small band. The girl wearing this was slim, but with  huge boobs. No cheating here. What a magnificent piece. Can I keep it?                              Orion: No.                                                                                          Akira-san: Agh, that's too bad... Well, in any case... Orion and Nova win the second challenge!     Dolores: Really? Where the fuck did you find that?                                                  Nova: *Giggles* A magician never explains his tricks.                                               Dolores: Bah.                                                                                       Akira-san: This is getting interesting, guys. You're tied! And now... it is time for the third      challenge of the night! This is... The polygraph. Please, sit around the table. This entire         challenge revolves around one of my greatest inventions.                                            Akira puts a strange heavy-looking machine on top of the table.                                     Akira-san: The DK Tron ZLF-9000!                                                                    Nova: Not a very commercial name.                                                                   Akira-san: It's not the final name. But anyway, what matters is that it works! The DK Tron ZLF-9000 serves the same purpose as any other polygraph, but it doesn't require cables or annoying           connections. It is capable of detecting lies just by analyzing your voice!                          Nova: Really? Just like that?                                                                       Akira-san: Just like that! See for yourself. *Clears throat* The capital of Germany is Toronto. When you tell a lie, an alarm is triggered and that red bulb lights up.                                 Haskel: Wow, that's honestly impressive. It's true what they say about you in the department. You're brilliant.                                                                                         Akira-san: Of course, it only works if I'm aware that I'm lying. If I really believed that Toronto  is the capital of Germany, the DK Tron wouldn't detect it as a lie.                                 Orion: And what does the “fog” button do?                                                           Akira-san: What?                                                                                    Orion: The orange button.                                                                           Akira-san: It produces fog. What else would it do?                                                  Orion: . . .                                                                                        Akira-san: . . .                                                                                    Orion: What...?                                                                                     Akira-san: It emits a dense vapor that appears similar to smoke.                                    Orion: B-But why...?                                                                                Akira-san: Why what?                                                                                Orion: Why the hell does a polygraph have a fog feature?                                            Akira-san: Why not? It creates ambience.                                                            Orion: . . .                                                                                        Akira-san: . . . If you wanted to buy a polygraph and there was a model that releases fog and       another one that doesn't, which one would you buy? Same price.                                      Orion: . . .                                                                                        Akira-san: . . .                                                                                    Orion: Can I press it?                                                                              Akira-san: No.                                                                                      Orion: . . .                                                                                        Dolores: *Clears throat* Helloooo? Can we start or not? Can you leave your fog-business             conversations for later?                                                                            Akira-san: Ah, yes, sorry! The challenge is simple. We just have to hold a conversation for 5       minutes. The first team to lie 10 times, loses!                                                     Nova: 10 lies? In 5 minutes? Why would anyone do that?                                              Akira-san: Probably no one... ...unless you have something to hide.                                 Nova: Uh... I certainly don't.                                                                      Akira-san: You have nothing to worry about, then! We shall begin. The time starts... NOW! Tell me,  Dolores, how old are you?                                                                           Dolores: I'm 23.                                                                                    Akira-san: What are you studying, Haskel?                                                           Haskel: Engineering. Although... I'm very far from your level. I usually escape with a “C” minus.   Akira-san: Do you study here too, Orion?                                                            Orion: I don't. I'm still in high school, actually. I moved to Kredon a couple of months ago as part of a student exchange program.                                                                     Akira-san: When was the last time you masturbated, Nova?                                            Nova: W-Wait, WHAT? Why am I the only one who gets asked a lewd question?                           Akira-san: Just a question like any other. Tell me, when was the last time you touched yourself?    Nova: I-I don't remember.                                                                           Akira-san: First lie of the night!                                                                  Nova: What?!                                                                                        Dolores: *Laughs* You do remember! Come on, don't be such a prude. We're just having fun. I'll      answer too. I think it was... last Sunday.                                                          Nova: Last time...? Um... t-two days ago.                                                           Orion: (I'm starting to like this game...)                                                          Akira-san: Were you watching porn?                                                                  Nova: Well... y-yeah.                                                                               Akira-san: What kind of porn do you like?                                                           Nova: I-I don't wanna say it!                                                                       Akira-san: If you don't answer the questions, you lose this challenge!                              Nova: What?! This wasn't part of the rules.                                                         Dolores: Whatever, I'll start. I like group sex, squirting, and interracial. Oh, and lesbian!       Nova: I like... um... I'm not sure. Normal porn. OKAY, OKAY! JEEZ! It d-depends on the day. I like  role-play videos. And hentai. And... porn games.                                                    Dolores: Porn games? Like... “Press A to get fucked”?                                               Nova: Of course not. They're visual novels, but... for adults. With sex. And good stories! You      wouldn't understand it.                                                                             Dolores: It sounds like what I said but with extra steps.                                           Haskel: Porn categories, huh? I like big tits, and–                                                 Akira-san: Shut up Haskel, no one cares. So, Nova... no lesbian category, like Dolores?             Nova: Uhh... not really. B-But I like threesome videos. Or... group sex. Like... various girls in   the same scene. D-Does that make me lesbian?                                                        Akira-san: *Chuckles* I don't know. Have you ever been with a girl?                                 Nova: No!                                                                                           Akira-san: But if you had to hook up with another girl... Who would it be?                          Nova: W-What? I-I don't know. I hate this machine! Uh... P-Probably Penelope, I guess. I've always  admired her. And now that we're friends and we share some... interests... I don't know. If I had to do it, it'd be her.                                                                                 Dolores: Penelope? Penelope Carter? That IG model in the journalism program? *Laughs* Please, she   doesn't even know you exist.                                                                        Nova: Of course she does. We're besties!                                                            Dolores: Besties? I follow her Insta and I've never seen you there.                                 Nova: Because she met me not that long ago. But we play Eternum together!                           Dolores: That doesn't mean anything. Have you gone on a trip with her? Do you usually go to lunch   together? Have you seen each other naked?                                                           Nova: Actually, I have, smartass!                                                                   Dolores: What?!                                                                                     Nova: I mean, I saw some photos on her laptop when...                                               Dolores: She lent her personal laptop to you?                                                       Nova: N-Not exactly. I saw them... remotely.                                                        Dolores: *Chuckles* What? Are you a hacker or something?                                            Nova: A-A what? Of course not! O-Okay, maybe something like that. But I just took a peek! And I     haven't done anything like that in weeks! Not since Orion made me realize it was wrong! And I'll    never do it again, I swear!                                                                         Haskel: I'd lend my laptop to my Dolores without hesitation. I have nothing to hide.                Dolores: Yeah, I would too, honey. O-Okay, maybe not.  But it's a natural reaction. I had some bad  experiences with my ex.                                                                             Akira-san: Your ex, huh? How many boys have you been with?                                          Dolores: Uh... four.                                                                                Haskel: Four? When we started dating you told me I was your third.                                  Dolores: Did I? You must be misremembering it.                                                      Haskel: Huh? What does this mean? Didn't you tell me I was your third?                              Dolores: I didn't. I mean... when we started dating, I had been with four guys already. I'll break  this fucking piece of junk!                                                                         Haskel: You cheated on me?!                                                                         Dolores: Of course not, sweetie!                                                                    Haskel: How could you?                                                                              Dolores: It was just a kiss! O-Okay, this machine is completely broken! I-It was little more than a kiss! And why am I the only one answering things? Have YOU ever cheated on your boyfriend?          Nova: Who, me?! Orion and I aren't even dating. We're just friends.                                 Akira-san: What about your other relationships?                                                     Nova: Uh... I mean... I've never been in a serious relationship.                                    Dolores: Hah! Really? More of a one-night stand girl, eh? Are your knees skinned from all the head  you go around giving?                                                                               Nova: What are you talking about? My knees are smooth as hell.                                      Dolores: How many boys have you slept with?                                                         Nova: That's none of your business.                                                                 Dolores: You have to answer! Akira said so. How many?                                               Nova: Uh... slept with? I don't know.                                                               Orion: Stop saying you don't know things you do know, Nova! We're gonna lose!                       Nova: Okay, okay, sorry!                                                                            Dolores: Still waiting... How many guys have you had sex with?                                      Nova: S-Sex? As in... sex-sex?                                                                      Dolores: What kind of question is that? Yes, sex-sex.                                               Nova: Uhh.... I'm not sure... a few.                                                                Dolores: What? Wait... are you a virgin?                                                            Nova: No! This machine is broken!                                                                   Orion: There's nothing wrong with that, Nova.                                                       Nova: I-I know, but I'm not! SHUT UP!                                                               Dolores: Oh my god, you're still a virgin! How old are you?                                         Nova: Shut up.                                                                                      Akira-san: That's cute! You must be looking forward to having someone with whom you can test all    your kinky desires.                                                                                 Nova: I'm not. Can someone turn this shit off?!                                                     Akira-san: Do you want Orion to deflower you?                                                       Nova: WHAT? NO!                                                                                     Akira-san: Ladies and gentlemen... IT'S OVER! Nova activated the DK Tron 10 times. Dolores and      Haskel get the point!                                                                               Nova: I'm glad this thing is over. This machine of yours doesn't work, Akira. What a scam.          Dolores: Y-Yeah, I've gotta agree with Nova on that. You need to fix it.                            Haskel: For a moment I believed it was legit.                                                       Orion: Um... well, I can't really comment on it, I barely talked.                                   Akira-san: You can deceive yourselves all you want, my machines are perfect. But anyway... Let's    move on to the next challenge! You'll have to follow me to the Auditorium and put on the clothes    you'll find by the entrance.                                                                        Dolores: *Standing up* What for?                                                                    Akira-san: You'll see soon enough. This is... The other world.                                      Nova: AAAAH YES! That's more like it! Now this is a party I can fit in at!                          Orion: *Chuckles* I'll admit this is the last thing I was expecting to do tonight. Looks like I     can't escape from Eternum, no matter how hard I try.                                                Nova: I feel right at home wearing this! Not that the Jinx costume is uncomfortable or anything, but there's something about the E-suit... it feels like a second skin!                                 Orion: Yep, I've gotta agree on that!                                                               Dolores: Yeah, yeah, I love it too. It really emphasizes the curves of the body. *Chuckles* It works better than a pair of leggings! It can make the flattest of butts pop. Right, Nova?                Nova: What do you mean “right, Nova”? Are you implying that I have a flat butt? Because I have a    better ass than you.                                                                                Dolores: *Chuckles* Oh please, you're drunk, girl. Don't let alcohol embarrass you.                 Nova: I'm not... Well, I'm a bit drunk, but that doesn't change anything.                           Dolores: Don't feel bad. Everyone has their qualities. I have a great body, and you have... um...   that funny glass eye of yours.                                                                      Nova: *Grunting* It's not made of glass. And you won't change my mind. There are literally only     three things I'm confident in: my computer skills, my marksmanship, and my butt. I have a decent    butt. We even used it in a heist! As a distraction! I take it back, I have a GREAT butt.            Dolores: Is that what your mother tells you?                                                        Nova: Uh... Well, yes, but she's telling the truth. She always tells me everything I do wrong. Which is... a lot. So when she gives me a compliment, I know it's true. Dalia said so too! And she has   the best one I've seen. She said I have good muscle genetics or something like that.                Dolores: I have no clue who Dalia is, but fine, let’s let the guys decide, shall we?                Orion: Hmm?                                                                                         Dolores: Who has the best butt? Nova or me?                                                         Nova: Fine, whatever you want!                                                                      Orion: Uhh... Well, I'm not saying this because Nova is my...                                       Friend                                                                                              Orion: ...my friend, but she clearly has the best ass here.                                         Teammate                                                                                            Orion: ...my teammate, but she clearly has the best ass here.                                       Girl                                                                                                Orion: ...my girl, but she clearly has the best ass here.                                           Nova: Hah! See??                                                                                    Dolores: Well, duh, what's he supposed to say? Haskel?!                                             Haskel: Um... It's obvious that you have the best butt, Dolores. Clearly. It's much... better       looking.                                                                                            Orion: *Imitating the sound of Akira's polygraph* Meeeec!                                           Akira-san: Okay, guys! Please take a seat! I hope no one left their Eternum neural implant at home! Hahaha! Hah! You get it? Because it can't be taken out! No? Tough crowd... *clears throat* Okay, sit down!                                                                                              Nova: This one will be the easiest challenge, Orion. Between Dione and your powers, we'll destroy   them!                                                                                               Akira-san: I'll send you an invite. Please join the server and wait for further instructions.       Nova: *Putting the visor on* Bring it on, Akira. We're ready! Let's kick ass, Orion!                Orion: And here we go again...                                                                      Connected. Welcome back to Eternum. Please prepare to connect...                                    Orion: *Looking down* Holy cow...                                                                   Nova: Damn!                                                                                         Orion: We... W-We're hanging 100 meters above the ground!                                           Nova: *Laughs* This is so cool!                                                                     Orion: Holy shit, slipping here would mean an instant death.                                        Nova: Can you imagine? “Thanatos finds the last Gem of Doom and becomes the new CEO of Ulysses. The previous owner slipped off a crane and cracked his head.”                                           Orion: *Laughs* That's definitely not how I want to be remembered. *Standing up* Looks like we're in a harbor of some sort. But it's just a small island in the middle of nowhere, there's water in all directions. Do you have any idea of what this could be?                                             Nova: *Standing up* Hmm... I see no other players. I'd bet it's one of those private servers I've   heard about.                                                                                        Orion: (Hmm, Akira could have access to a private server just like Dalia, it's very possible.       Although, I prefer Dalia's. For several reasons...)                                                 Nova: Either that, or a Battle Royale server. Some people love that adrenaline rush, even if it     means the possibility of losing everything they have.                                               Orion: You know, if you chose this outfit to validate your previous statement about your butt... you succeeded. You look so sexy in it...                                                               Nova: *Giggles* Thank you! It's my combat outfit. I usually use this one in the servers where guns  are allowed.                                                                                        Orion: Good choice, no doubt.                                                                       Nova leans against the rail and the wind starts waving her curls.                                   Orion: *Chuckles* It feels almost weird seeing you with your normal hair again.                     Nova: Right? It's crazy how different a person can look just by changing their hairstyle.           Orion: You look good with any hair.                                                                 Nova: *Giggles* Thanks. Your outfit is pretty cool, too!                                            Orion: Yeah! I found it in a space server where I played with Annie. Yeah! Annie found it in a space server she usually plays.                                                                          Nova: Andromeda?                                                                                    Orion: That one! We've gotta go back there and play together sometime. That one! We've gotta go     there and play together sometime.                                                                   Nova: For sure! We could spend our whole lives in that server and we wouldn't be able to discover   everything. That server is gigantic.                                                                Orion: That sounds amazing. Although all servers in Eternum are amazing, in a sense. All of them    have something that makes them special. I wonder what Akira prepared for us in this one.            Nova: Whatever it is, we have to win! I NEED that CPU!                                              Orion: Is it really that important? The one you have right now isn’t good enough?                   Nova: Well... it is, but with better hardware I can do more things. And faster. So I'll be able to  help you more.                                                                                      Orion: You do enough, Nova. We wouldn't even have a Gem of Doom if it wasn't for you.               Nova: I know, but... I have to keep getting better. I feel like... I feel like if I don't contribute something to the team, if I'm not constantly helping you by hacking some network, getting an IP    address, or programming some device... I won't be needed anymore. And I... I don't want to be left  out.                                                                                                Orion: (I didn't know she felt like this. I guess that explains her constant need for validation.) I hope you realize how stupid that is. We're not gonna shut you out, Nova. Especially not me. I love spending time with you.                                                                             Nova: *Giggles* Hearing that makes me feel good. Thank you, Orion.                                  Orion: Which doesn't mean that you can stop being my personal hacker, of course! I need the best of the best on my team!                                                                                Nova: Oh, I won't let you down, rest assured!                                                       A strange looking drone suddenly approaches you.                                                    Orion: Oh? What's this?                                                                             Akira-san: Sorry for the delay!                                                                     Nova: That's Akira-san's voice!                                                                     Akira-san: The challenge is about to begin! It is very simple. You four are the only players in this harbor of 2 square miles. And each team has spawned on opposite sides of the island.               Nova: Oh... it's true! I can see them.                                                              Orion: Really? Where?                                                                               Nova: Right there, on top of that other crane at the end of the harbor.                             Orion: *Squinting your eyes* Hmm... that's way too far. How can you see them? I can't see shit.     Akira-san: You have 30 minutes to eliminate the other team! The last one standing, wins the         challenge! Questions?                                                                               Orion: Yeah, what happens if we die? Do we lose our level and inventory?                            Akira-san: You don't! This is a training server, the penalties for dying are not applied here. If   you win, you'll find an Exit Portal right in the center of the harbor.                              Nova: Can we use our own weapons?                                                                   Akira-san: Correct! You can use any kind of weapon in your inventory.                               Nova: Cool!                                                                                         Dolores: Do you see them?                                                                           Haskel: Yeah, I do... And I don't think they've spotted us. They don't have binoculars. We'll skirt those warehouses on the right and we'll take them by surprise on their way here. They won't see us  coming.                                                                                             Dolores: *Laughs* They're ours!                                                                     Akira-san: The countdown has officially begun, challengers. Good luck!                              The drone flies away from you.                                                                      Orion: Alright, Nova! Let's get to work! 30 minutes is a lot of time, but this place is huge. Here's my plan: after going down the crane, we split. I'll march forward towards their location through   the warehouses. You're gonna climb on those containers and you'll cover me with your sniper. At the end, I think it's all coming down to who spots the other team first. We need to exercise caution and watch each other’s backs. I'll try to keep a clear line of sight so we can see each other, but     whistle really loudly if you need back up! Thoughts? . . . Um... N-Nova? Is that... Dione? W-What... WHAT?!                                                                                             Nova: We won the challenge! Now there's only 1 left!                                                Orion: You're. The. Craziest. Most unpredictable. And downright the most amazing girl I've ever met! That shit was ridiculous!                                                                          Nova: *Giggles* Thank you, thank you. I had a clean shot, so I thought I couldn't waste that        opportunity. And besides, we lost the polygraph test because of me, so I make up for it a little    with this!                                                                                          Orion: You definitely did! By a landslide!                                                          Nova: We're tied 2-2 now. So... let's finish the job! No time to waste.                             Orion: *Laughs* For sure. Let's go find that Exit Portal. *Removing your visor* Holy fuck! That     was... fast!                                                                                        Nova: *Standing up* And that's how you play Eternum! We're the best team ever.                      Orion: *Laughs* I didn't do shit this time, but thanks.                                             Dolores: What... What the fuck happened...?                                                         Nova: *Sticking her tongue out* AAAAAH! Your ass got wiped out, that's what happened. You're not    mocking me now? Did you run out of sarcastic comments?                                              Dolores: Why would I? That was... AMAZING.                                                          Nova: Say what you want, I– Wait, did you say amazing? Really?                                      Dolores: That was so cool! Did you really spot and hit us with a missile launcher from that         distance?                                                                                           Nova: *Giggles* Well, yes. I took advantage of a small moment when the wind stopped blowing.        Dolores: Wow... consider me your new fan! If there's someone who deserves that CPU, it's you, Nova. Haskel, we're out of the competition. We'll let them win.                                           Nova: Really?!                                                                                      Haskel: WHAT?! Are you kidding me? We can still win the last challenge!                             Dolores: But we won't. Didn't you see what she did there while you were using your shitty           binoculars?! We're not worthy. Let's go back to the party. I just wanna forget about this and get   drunk.                                                                                              Haskel: Goddammit, Dolores...                                                                       Dolores: Take care, guys.                                                                           Orion: Bye, Dolores! Thank you!                                                                     Nova: Oh my god, Orion! Did you hear that?! We won! And we don't even have to do the last challenge! We won already! We-                                                                                Akira-san: ABSOLUTELY NOT.                                                                          Orion: What? We're the only participants left!                                                      Akira-san: I don't care. I won't give my CPU away unless you've earned it. There's still one        challenge left. If you can pass it, the prize is yours. If not, I'll keep it myself and sell it on  eBay.                                                                                               Nova: That's not fair.                                                                              Akira-san: My game, my rules!                                                                       Nova: What a buzzkill...                                                                            Akira-san: Don't worry guys, the last challenge is probably the funnest one and the easiest by far. Orion: You say that about all your challenges.                                                      Akira-san: But this time it's true! Please, put on your costumes again and come with me to the      library. This is... The temptation.                                                                 Orion: *Sighs* This better be the last one...                                                       Moving away from the party, Akira leads you upstairs and enters the last room on the right.         Akira-san: Here it is! Please, sit down.                                                            Orion: Okay, Akira, we don't have all night, so... straight to the point.                           Akira-san: Of course, of course! You see... in this last challenge, you must prove that you're      capable of controlling your impulses. I'll leave the room for 25 minutes, and all you have to do is stay away from each other.                                                                          Nova: Staying away? What do you mean?                                                               Akira-san: This is another one of the devices I created in my spare time. I call it... the TGF      Cyberspunk-X7.                                                                                      Orion: ...Naming your gadgets is definitely not your forte.                                         Akira-san: There's a sensor in this library that's capable of detecting Ulysses' neural implants,   like the ones we have on the back of our necks. If two implants get too close, an alert is          triggered.                                                                                          Nova: What if we didn't have neural implants?                                                       Akira-san: Then you'd have lost already, not being able to complete either of the last two          challenges. Anyone who doesn't play Eternum isn't worthy of my prize.                               Nova: Okay, so... if I understood this correctly, we have to keep away from each other for 25       minutes? That's it?                                                                                 Akira-san: That is correct. You can't leave this room, and you must stay at least 6 feet apart.     Otherwise, the alarm will be triggered and you'll lose the challenge.                               Nova: Hah! This doesn't make much sense, but it sounds easy enough!                                 Orion: Right? I don't see the point of this “challenge” if he tells us what we're not supposed to do beforehand, but hey, I won't complain.                                                             Akira-san: Well... now comes the interesting part. This is a special wine I brought home from       England last summer. It's only produced in a small village of less than 100 inhabitants and it is   said to be a very powerful aphrodisiac. People there called it... “Ember’s Moan”.                   Nova: A... powerful aphrodisiac?                                                                    Akira-san: Yes. But don't worry, there's only a little sip for each of you. The effects shouldn't be too extreme. You drink the wine, you stay here for 25 minutes, and, if you can resist the          temptation, you win the prize. Easy.                                                                Nova: *Laughs* What? You really think I'm gonna throw myself at Orion and start kissing him or      something just because I drank this thing?                                                          Orion: *Chuckles* Absurd.                                                                           Akira-san: Alright then! Let's do it. Cheers!                                                       You and Nova drink the wine in one gulp.                                                            Nova: Mmmm...! Is this really wine? It tastes like a strawberry lollipop.                           Orion: Mmm! Wine or not, it’s delicious.                                                            Akira-san: *Standing up* Fantastic! I'll be downstairs getting a rum and coke. Remember, you can't  leave the room or you'll be disqualified!                                                           Nova: Yes, yes, we got it.                                                                          Akira-san: See you in 25 minutes! Have fun! But not too much fun! And everything's clean, don't     worry!                                                                                              Orion: What a character.                                                                            Nova: *Standing up* Okay, Orion! We can finally say it: WE WON THE PRIZE!                           Orion: *Chuckles* Hell yes! This last challenge turned out to be way easier than I thought.         Nova: Now all we have to do is overcome boredom for 25 minutes.                                     Orion: Sounds simple enough. *Standing up* So, this is your library, huh? There are quite a lot of  books.                                                                                              Nova: Yeah, although no one uses them, to be honest. Students simply bring their laptops or tablets. Everything has become digitized. So now this place is mostly... a fuck pad where people come to    make out.                                                                                           Orion: *Laughs* Are those... condoms?                                                               Nova: *Giggles* Yeah, some fraternity is probably planning to play a dirty game here later. Either  that or Akira left this here for some reason.                                                       Orion: *Laughs* Yeah, I think it's the latter. I guess this is what he meant when he said that      “everything was clean”. There's more over here. Look at what I found! Would you be able to wear this while going around, Nova?                                                                          Nova: *Giggles* Shut up!                                                                            Orion: Hey be careful, don't get too close! I don't want to lose the challenge just because you     can't curb your irrepressible desire to kiss me.                                                    Nova: *Chuckles* Me? I won't move from here.                                                        Orion: *Sitting down* Sounds good. I won't move from here, then. More than 6 feet away.             Nova: Cool. You feeling anything?                                                                   Orion: Nope. Well... apart from the alcohol I already had in my blood. You?                         Nova: I'm fine. Just a little drunk.                                                                Orion: Cool. So... now we wait.                                                                     Nova: We wait.                                                                                      Orion: Just 24 minutes left.                                                                        Nova: Cool. Cool.                                                                                   Orion: Cool. Still good?                                                                            Nova: I'm fine! You?                                                                                Orion: I'm fine.                                                                                    Nova: C-Cool.                                                                                       Orion: Yeah, cool.                                                                                  Nova: Now we wait.                                                                                  Orion: Cool... *Taking a deep breath* (Okay... This...) *Hyperventilating* (THIS IS NOT COOL. What  the fuck was in that wine... I'm hornier than an off-duty marine in Thailand.) *Taking another deep breath* . . . (Jesus, I'd even fuck a watermelon if there was one in front of me. And what's with   this huge erection? It's starting to hurt, even. Was there Viagra in that damn drink?!) . . . (Am I the only one having a meltdown right now?)                                                          You can see Nova curled up on her chair nervously jiggling her legs.                                Nova: (Oh god. OH MY FUCKING GOD. I NEED TO TOUCH MYSELF. What is happening to me?! At this rate    I'll end up seeping through my pants. I haven't felt this horny since that day in the Egyptian      server. Oh no, Nova, don't think about that again... Not again... Stop thinking about that day...   God, that day... I wish that Orion fucked ME against the wall, not Maat... I wish that Orion fucked ME against the ground, not Maat... The way she was moaning with pleasure... There was... so much    force in those thrusts... The noise of Orion's hips slamming against hers... I’ve never played with anything that big. C-Could I even take it...? I wish Orion would have fucked me that day... Oh      Jesus...)                                                                                           Orion: *Clears throat* So... Still good, Nova? Are you feeling anything?                            Nova: Um... P-Perhaps just a tiny, liiittle, small something, y-yeah. Y-you?                        Orion: I don’t think I've ever felt hornier in my life.                                             Nova: . . . O-Okay, I lied. ME TOO. I-I don’t think I’ve ever felt so... slick. I-I guess we’re both in this boat together, eh? Haha... Who would have thought that drink would really work, huh?       Orion: *Nervous laugh* Y-Yeah, right? Crazy.                                                        Nova: I have like... t-this weird sensation inside... Like a... Burning. It’s like something is     making me just want to... tear off my clothes and go to town on myself...                           Orion: Right?!                                                                                      Nova: Must be the wine.                                                                             Orion: I guess so.                                                                                  Nova: . . . Are you... A-Are you hard?                                                              Orion: Um... yep. I've been stiff for quite some time already.                                      Nova: . . . Makes sense. Can't blame you.                                                           Orion: So... wetter than you’ve ever been, huh?                                                     Nova: Well... Yeah. My panties are just so... damp. Y-You know, the wine.                           Orion: Yeah, the wine... Isn't it funny how we always end up stuck in the most bizarre situations?  First, we're taken as hostages by a crazy Egyptian nympho... and now this.                          Nova: Oh, that day... y-yeah, I'd forgotten about it. But... well, this is different. That time we  were forced to... get intimate. This time it's just the opposite. Easier. Much easier.              That shit was nuts                                                                                  Orion: I wouldn't want to repeat that, that's for sure. I hope we never get to see that woman again.Nova: Yeah, I hope not...                                                                           Maat was hot, though                                                                                Orion: I'll admit it had a certain thrill. God, I'd pay to have Maat here and fuck her again... to  throw her up against the shelves and just go to town...                                             Nova: . . . I'm sure you would...                                                                   That blowjob was something else                                                                     Orion: That blowjob, though? My god, I'd go broke just to repeat that right now.                    Nova: . . . You're saying that because of the wine.                                                 Orion: Ehh... I'm not so sure, to be honest. I've been thinking about it since that day. It was...  fucking amazing. Those faces you made, Nova... The way you started choking...                       Nova: I mean... it was... entertaining, I guess. I was trying to make it look a-accurate, for Maat. I-I mean it’s not like I... wanted to... *Clears throat* B-But anyway, let's change the subject.    This is not helping.                                                                                Orion: Yeah... How much time is left?                                                               Nova: I don't even wanna know.                                                                      Orion: You know... I just had an idea that would make this much easier for both of us.              Nova: I'm all ears...                                                                               Propose touching yourselves                                                                         Orion: There's a way we could reduce this craving we're feeling.                                    Try getting distracted and hold on                                                                  Orion: Let's try to think of other stuff. Like a naked grandma, bad food, or disgusting stuff in    general. Time will fly by.                                                                          Nova: What a shitty idea.                                                                           Orion: Trust me, just do what I say.                                                                Nova: Hmm...                                                                                        Making an effort to think about non sexual things, you start feeling the craving gradually reduce   until the time is over.                                                                             Orion: Is it time? Fucking finally.                                                                 Nova: I don't feel so good...                                                                       Akira-san: *Knocking on the door* Hey there! I'm back! There's only 30 seconds left for you to win  the challenge! Nova? Orion? Are you still there?                                                    Orion: Yeah, yeah, we're here. We could... touch ourselves.                                         Nova: WHAT?!                                                                                        Orion: Think about it. A quick wank and all this urge goes away. We win the challenge, and          everyone's happy.                                                                                   Nova: You're crazy.                                                                                 Orion: Is that a no?                                                                                Nova: It's a... “do what you want”. I'm n-not touching myself in front of you. But suit yourself.   Orion: Oh thank god... I don't think I could have held back much longer.                            You take off the robes that were covering your hips and thighs, releasing your cock in all its      splendor.                                                                                           Orion: *Sigh of relief* Oh god... Much better...                                                    Nova: Goddammit, Orion, I thought you'd go to a corner or something!                                Orion: What's the fun in that? And besides, don't act like we haven't seen each other naked         before...                                                                                           Nova: *Mumbling* Hmm.                                                                               You begin to slowly stroke your dick.                                                               Orion: AAAaaagh... Man, I needed this so much... No more craving. Now the wine only makes the       sensation feel... stronger.                                                                         Nova: . . .                                                                                         Orion: I thought you wanted me to go to the corner, Nova? But you can’t even take your eyes off     me...                                                                                               Nova: *Shaking her legs nervously* Hmm.                                                             Orion: Ahhh, yes... This feels so good... When I close my eyes, I can see you kneeling in front of  me that day, Nova... Do you remember?                                                               Nova: *Shaking her legs nervously* Hmm... vaguely.                                                  Orion: Oh fuck, you were so good... And when you hit my cock against your cheek... So fucking       sloppy...                                                                                           Nova: *Hyperventilating* . . .                                                                      Orion: So warm...                                                                                   Nova: OKAY, FINE. Do you want me to touch myself? FINE, I'll do it.                                 Orion: (OH YEAH!) I only proposed that because it'll help us. All I want is for you to win that CPU.Nova: Yeah... s-so do I.                                                                            Orion: Oh boy... You have a damn great butt, Nova. Dolores never stood a chance.                    Nova: *Little giggle* Right?                                                                        Nova sits back on her chair, refusing to turn away from your erect member.                          Orion: (She's super petite and slim, but she has these thighs... I wish I could shove my face       between them. And the way she looks at me... goddamn.) The sooner you start, the sooner you'll feel better, Nova...                                                                                     Nova: Yeah... I guess...                                                                            Orion: *Fapping faster* Oh, fuck yes...                                                             Nova: This wine is making my head spin...                                                           Orion: If you don't feel comfortable, you can go to the corner, like you said. I won't-             Nova: Nah. I... I don't mind. It's not as if we hadn't done anything before. This is nothing        compared to that day.                                                                               Orion: No arguments from me...                                                                      Nova moves her panties to the side, exposing her perfectly waxed pussy right in front of you.       Nova: Fuck, my insides are burning...                                                               Orion: I bet... Now... do it...                                                                     Nova: AAaaaargh... Oh... F-FUCK!                                                                    Orion: Better, right?                                                                               Nova: Yeah... *Moaning* M-Much, much better...                                                      Orion: Told you...                                                                                  Nova: Mmmm... F-Fuck, it feels more intense than usual... for some reason... Ahhh... This wine...   Orion: I'm not sure everything is the wine's fault, Nova. Admit you enjoy seeing me stroking my     cock... You can’t take your eyes off me jacking off, can you?                                       Nova: *Giggles* Perhaps a bit... Perhaps I... AAaaah... *Hyperventilating* Ahhhgh... F-Fuck, why    doesn’t this burning go away?                                                                       Orion: I don't know, but I feel the same way...                                                     Nova: Aaahh... better...                                                                            Orion: Oh lord, I missed this sight...                                                              Nova starts fingering herself faster and deeper, turning her attention from her own labor to your   dick, and vice versa.                                                                               Nova: AAAahhh, fuck yes...                                                                          Orion: Better...?                                                                                   Nova: M-Much better, yeah... B-But... at the same time... I feel hornier and hornier every second.  I-It's not a bad sensation, but... It’s as if my body wants... more. I-Is it not happening to you?  Orion: It started happening when you started fingering yourself in front of me...                   Nova: *Giggles* You're crazy.                                                                       Orion: I guess we're just two of a kind, then.                                                      Nova: *Moaning* Aaahh... I-I guess so...                                                            Orion: You seem to be enjoying yourself...                                                          Nova: I c-could say the... *Moaning* Ahhh... I could say the same... I... *Hyperventilating*        F-Fuck...                                                                                           Orion: Are you okay?                                                                                Nova: Why is this not enough?!                                                                      Orion: You know, I have an idea...                                                                  Nova: D-don't move from your chair!                                                                 Orion: I won't! My idea is right behind you, actually...                                            Nova: Hmm? W-Wait, what? The dildo? I-I'm not using that.                                           Orion: Come on... you know you want to... If not for you, do it for me... I NEED to see you using   it. Just this once...                                                                               Nova: . . .                                                                                         Orion: Imagine how good it would make you feel...                                                   Nova: . . . Fuck. D-don't tell my mom what I'm about to do.                                         Orion: Good girl...                                                                                 Replacing her embarrassment with curiosity, Nova gets on top of the table with a quick jump and     grabs the toy.                                                                                      Nova: God, this thing is way bigger than I thought.                                                 Orion: (I can’t tear my eyes away from her pussy... It looks so fucking tight. She doesn't even mind showing it to me anymore.)                                                                         Nova: ...and softer.                                                                                Orion: Is it stiff?                                                                                 Nova: Um... well... not really. I mean, it's rigid, but also flexible. I guess this way it's easier to...                                                                                               Orion: To put it inside your pussy.                                                                 Nova: Y-Yeah, that.                                                                                 Orion: You think you can take it all?                                                               Nova: I can't.                                                                                      Orion: Have you ever tried something so big?                                                        Nova: I-I have toys, but... nothing even half the size of this.                                     Orion: Well, there's only one way to test yourself...                                               Nova: . . . F-Fuck it. I can't hold it.                                                             Orion: Attagirl...                                                                                  She lets out a high-pitched whine as soon as she feels the cold surface of the dildo against her    pussy lips.                                                                                         Nova: *Moans* F-Fuck, it's cold.                                                                    Orion: It'll get warm soon enough...                                                                Nova: *Moans* Aaaahhhhhh...                                                                         Orion: That's it...                                                                                 Nova's vagina offers no resistance as she softly sticks the dildo inside of her.                    Nova: AAAaahhh... Gggggh... T-That's more like it...                                                Orion: Is this soothing that sensation you were feeling?                                            Nova: D-Definitely...                                                                               Orion: *Fapping faster* God... Does it feel better than your fingers?                               Nova: Much f-fucking better... I feel... f-f-filled.                                                Orion: I wish I could be the one filling you up...                                                  Nova: *Giggles* AAagh...                                                                            Nova stares directly at your dick.                                                                  Nova: Y-You'd be too big for me...                                                                  Orion: Nonsense... You're handling that dildo like such a pro, Nova. Think of it like... practice.  Nova: *Giggles* T-Thank you...                                                                      Orion: I could slide right in...                                                                    Nova: Aaaah...                                                                                      Orion: Does my cock turn you on?                                                                    Nova: *Moans* F-Fuck, it does... Ahhh...                                                            Orion: Do you like thinking about me sliding all the way into you, Nova?                            Nova: *Moans* I-I do... AAAH, FUCK...                                                               Nova accelerates the pace of her movements and pushes the dildo as far as her untrained vagina      allows her to.                                                                                      Nova: *Moaning* A-A-A-A-AAHH...                                                                     Orion: You liked sucking my cock, didn't you?                                                       Nova: I... I did...                                                                                 Orion: You say that Maat pressured you into it... but you were already curious, right?              Nova: *Moaning* Fuck...                                                                             Orion: Would you do it again?                                                                       Nova: A-Again? I mean... It was so... juicy... So huge... So... heavy in my hands... *Moans* AAAH!  W-We've gotta ask Akira where he bought this wine.                                                  Orion: I agree...                                                                                   Nova: *Pinching her own nipple* It made my whole body so s-sensitive... I need... more... I...      Nova suddenly comes down from the table.                                                            Orion: What's going on?                                                                             Nova: That pose... doesn't let me... ...go deep enough.                                             Orion: Oh my... are you going to do what I think you're going to do?                                Nova: *Getting on top of the table* Perhaps... are we going too far?                                Orion: Why? We're just playing a game at a party. Nothing else.                                     Nova: A p-pretty intense game.                                                                      Orion: I like to win. Don't you?                                                                    Nova: I do.                                                                                         Orion: And do you still have that burning sensation from the wine?                                  Nova: Fuck, I do...                                                                                 Orion: Then we're doing nothing wrong. We're gonna win this shit... but we don't have to suffer more than necessary.                                                                                    Nova: . . . I guess you're right... I hope you enjoy the show, then.                                Orion: You know I will...                                                                           Nova: AAAAAHHHH... Aaaaahhhh... Oh my god...                                                        Orion: Oh baby...                                                                                   Nova: *Panting* F-Fuck...                                                                           Orion: Are you finally feeling better now?                                                          Nova: Better... yeah.... MmMMm... much better...                                                    Orion: Did you ever get yourself off like this before?                                              Nova: *Panting* N-No... *Panting* T-The toy I have at home can't even stand upright...              Orion: I already know what to get you for Christmas this year, then.                                Nova: *Giggles* D-Don't you dare... AAAaaaahhh... y-yeah... *Panting* Fuck, this feels so good...   Nova continues to ride the dildo tirelessly while her own juices drip and soak the toy.             Orion: God, I love seeing your ass bouncing like that, Nova...                                      Nova: *Panting* Do you?                                                                             Orion: But I know you can take it deeper... I know my personal hacker girl can do better than       that...                                                                                             Nova: *Panting* Aaahh... can I...? I-Is that what you want?                                         Orion: Fuck yes...                                                                                  Following your command, Nova shoves the dildo deeper and deeper inside her with each bounce until   she's able to take it almost entirely.                                                              Nova: AAAAAaaaahh...                                                                                Orion: Good girl...                                                                                 Nova: Ggggghh... *Panting* L-Like this?                                                             Orion: Oh my fucking god, yes...                                                                    Nova: *Panting* AAaahh... aaahhh... ahhhh...                                                        Orion: (She looks so gone... her mind must be going a mile a minute.) The fact that I'm watching you while you ride that dildo turns you on, doesn't it?                                                Nova: *Panting* It does... I want you to watch me... I w-want you to keep your eyes on me, without  l-looking away...                                                                                   Orion: How many times have you fantasized about the Egyptian server?                                Nova: *Moaning* Aahhh... S-So many times... God, that was s-so f-fucking hot...... I couldn’t get   the sight of your... c-cock out of my head, Orion... And your groans when I took you into my        mouth... I think I masturbated for 2 weeks straight t-thinking about it.                            Orion: Oh yes...                                                                                    Nova: But it shouldn't have been so... hot... that was supposed to be... s-scary. W-Why was it so   hot? *Panting* Is it bad that I thought about it so much, Orion? The smells, the sounds... The way  my heart was racing... Am I... broken, Orion?                                                       Orion: No, you're not, Nova... You’re just... curious.                                              Nova: AAAaaaahh... *Panting* F-Fuck... *Panting* I g-got to the bottom...                           Orion: That's my girl... You're such a fast learner, Nova.                                          Nova: *Panting* F-Fuck yess... *Groaning* AAAaaaAAAAaahh...                                         Orion: Oh sweet Lord...                                                                             Nova: HHHHhhggg... t-this is so good...                                                             Orion: (I can't stop imagining Nova riding my cock instead of that dildo... She always seems to have infinite energy. I bet she'd be able to bounce up and down for hours until I passed out... Boy,    I've gotta live to experience something like that one day...)                                       Nova: *Groaning* Aaaaahh... f-fuck... F-FUCK! I'm gonna cum, Orion...                               Orion: The things you said at the cafeteria... they were all lies, right?                           Nova: *Groaning with pleasure* Ehh...? Ah... y-yes...                                               Orion: You ARE looking for someone to fulfill all your kinky desires.                               Nova: *Groaning* YES...                                                                             Orion: And you want ME to fuck you...                                                               Nova: I'm gonna c-cum...                                                                            Orion: I asked you a question...                                                                    Nova: AAAAHHhh...                                                                                   Orion: Nova...                                                                                      Nova: YES! I want YOU to fuck me! *Panting* Only you...                                             Orion: Oh babe...                                                                                   Grab Nova and fuck her                                                                              Nova: W-What...?! No! I-I was almost there! Orion! W-What the fuck are you doing?!                  Orion: Nova, I need to feel that tight pussy of yours...                                            Nova: WHAT?! We're gonna lose the challenge!                                                        Orion: Fuck that challenge...                                                                       Nova: I don't... I... My god, y-your cock is even bigger than the dildo! AND WAY THICKER!           Orion: Imagine how it'd feel inside of you...                                                       Nova: I... eh... I-I'm not gonna lose my virginity in a lib- I-I mean... I don't... I can't!        Orion: You said that you wanted me to-                                                              Nova: It was the wine talking! J-Just dirty talk! And the burning is gone already! I-It was a great idea, so now we can sto...                                                                          Akira-san: *Knocking on the door* Hey there, guys! The challenge is over! Nova? Orion?              Nova: F-Fuck! Told you! G-Get off me!                                                               Orion: (Goddammit...)                                                                               You quickly get dressed again and hide your boner as best as you can.                               Orion: (Fuck. What the hell happened to me? I knew the challenge was about to end and he could be   back any second. I got carried away... I need to learn some self-control.)                          Akira-san: Hello?                                                                                   Orion: *Clears throat* Y-Yeah, yeah, we're here.                                                    Let her cum                                                                                         Nova: Oh god... Yeah... OH GOD! I'm cumming! *Groans* AAAAAaaargh...                                Nova lets the full length of the dildo get inside her and orgasms, contracting all the muscles of   her slim body.                                                                                      Nova: *Groans* AAaaah... *Collapsing* Jesus...                                                      Orion: My god... That was hot as fuck, Nova...                                                      Nova: *Panting* Yeah...                                                                             Orion: Why can't I cum too?! This cursed wine is fucking with me... I'm horny as fuck, but I can't  cum!                                                                                                Nova: *Recovering her breath* That got a bit out of hand.                                           Orion: You did great. I knew you could take it all...                                               Nova: *Recovering her breath* It sure was... intense...                                             Akira-san: *Knocking on the door* Hey there, guys! The challenge is over!                           Nova: F-Fuck! The challenge! I almost forgot about it! D-Distract him, p-please!                    Orion: W-What? Me?                                                                                  Nova: Y-Yeah! I s-still have a dildo inside my p-pussy, in case you didn't notice!                  You quickly get dressed again and hide your boner as best as you can.                               Orion: (Fuck. Why the hell couldn't I cum? This fucking blue-balling wine...)                       Akira-san: Nova? Orion?                                                                             Orion: *Clears throat* Y-Yeah, yeah, we're here.                                                    Akira-san: Ah, wonderful! Happy to see you in one piece!                                            Orion: Y-Yeah, thanks.                                                                              Akira-san: You guys... won Akira-san's challenge! Congratulations!                                  Orion: A-Awesome!                                                                                   Akira-san: Or... that's what I'd say if you had really won.                                         Orion: Wait, what?                                                                                  Akira-san: Don't play dumb, Orion. The alarm on my receiver was triggered just a moment ago. I know you two got too close. You failed my challenge.                                                     Nova: *Appearing from under a table* W-What? That's absurd! It must have been a defect of the       device.                                                                                             Orion: (Did she put her top on backwards...?)                                                       Akira-san: *Chuckles* Funny! But my devices have no defects.                                        Nova: Then... maybe someone else with a neural implant got right under me on the floor below. So... the device was triggered! I mean, think about it. We held out for 24 minutes just to fail at the    last second? That doesn't make any sense!                                                           Akira-san: Hmm... Well, now that you mention it... ...yeah, the truth is that it would have been    ridiculous. And I guess that could have happened, indeed.                                           Nova: Exactly.                                                                                      Orion: (Phew.)                                                                                      Akira-san: Let me begin again, then... You guys... won Akira-san's challenge! Congratulations!      Nova: Hell yes!                                                                                     Akira-san: Tell me, how did it go?                                                                  Nova: *Appearing from under a table* YES! We did it!                                                Orion: (Did she put her top on backwards...?)                                                       Akira-san: Indeed. Tell me, how did it go?                                                          Nova: W-What? I mean, oh well, *nervous laugh* it's true that it makes you hornier. WAY hornier. But it wasn't a-anything we couldn't handle! Right, Orion?                                             Orion: T-Totally!                                                                                   Akira-san: Now... what if I told you that my “wine”... was just sugary fruit juice?                 Nova: *Gasps* What? You can't be serious.                                                           Akira-san: Just sugar and strawberry juice. Everything you felt... was already within yourself.     Nova: Oh my god...                                                                                  Orion: . . . That's such bullshit.                                                                  Akira-san: Eh... Okay, okay, you got me. It looks cool when they say this in movies. Uh... yeah, it really was a powerful aphrodisiac, not fruit juice. It's actually illegal in many countries.        Nova: Hmm...                                                                                        Orion: Fucking trickster...                                                                         Akira-san: In fact, it's not recommended to drink it along with alcohol to avoid gastric problems.  Nova: . . . Oh god, I don't feel so good...                                                         Akira-san: Yeah... that's what I was referring to. It doesn't make everyone sick, but the ones      affected can't stop puking for a good 30-60 minutes.                                                Nova: Fuck, you could have said that before... Aghh... My stomach hurts. I-I  need to go to the     bathroom.                                                                                           Orion: Do you want me to go with you?                                                               Nova: No, no, I don’t want you to see me like that. Go and check on Penny, or... I don't know, wait for me somewhere nearby.                                                                            Akira-san: I'll go get the CPU and bring it back to you.                                            Nova: Y-You better! I'll come find you if you... . . .                                              Nova rushes out from the room.                                                                      Akira-san: Yeah, she probably drank too many beers...                                               Orion: She only drank one!                                                                          Akira-san: But she was drunk! That's what matters! Look at you, you drank the same amount of wine   and many more beers than her, but you are fine! We all have different metabolisms.                  Orion: Is she gonna be okay?                                                                        Akira-san: Of course, of course, don't worry! I'll wait for her next to the bathroom so I can give  her the CPU.                                                                                        Orion: Well alright... Tell her to join me and Penelope when she's done!                            Akira-san: Will do! Farewell, Orion. It was a pleasure playing with you. Adios!                     Orion: O-Okay, see ya. (Man, that sure was a peculiar... game. At least I can say the University of Kredon has a well-deserved reputation. Those inventions were mind-blowing. I feel sorry for Nova,   but there's not much I can do for her right now. I'm certain this was an interesting experience for her, though. I wonder if she really meant everything she said in here or if she was just playing    along because of the wine. In any case, I bet she doesn't regret it... Or... well, so I hope. Let's see if Penelope managed to clean the beer from her hair.) I should ask at the counter before going  anywhere. (I've gotta find Penelope before she sees the photos. Let's go to the main hall, she's    supposed to be there.)                                                                              You start heading towards the main hall, just to stumble upon Penelope checking her phone.          Orion: (Oh, fuck.) Erm... H-Hey Penny! I... I-I was looking for you! I went to... Uh...             Penelope: Yeah! I...                                                                                Orion: Um... (Shit, is she crying?) D-Did you see the photos?                                       Penelope: Y-Yeah. I... I see you two were having fun, huh?                                          Orion: It's not what it seems! We didn't do any–                                                    Penelope: Hey, you don't have to give me any explanations. I'm not your mom! Or... your girlfriend, or anything. This is a party, right?                                                                Orion: I-I don't know what I was thinking. I just...                                                Penelope: It's my fault. I shouldn't have asked you to help me with my boring shit. I see it now.   You just came here to drink, have fun, and meet girls, and I... just kept bugging you with...       Orion: You didn't bug me with anything!                                                             Penelope: Hey, you can do whatever the fuck you want. It's just that... *Crying* T-That... With her? Regina? Really?                                                                                    Orion: Regina doesn't mean shit to me! She just tricked me!                                         Penelope: Tricked? Then how did you end up naked with her in the locker room?                       Orion: Um... W-Well...                                                                              Penelope: *Sobbing* God, I'm a fucking idiot. I can't believe I was so damn dumb.                   Orion: I'm so sorry, Penny... I didn't want any of this to happen.                                  Penelope: It's my fault. It always is. I... I'm sorry, I'm such a drama queen, eh? *Sighs* I...     guess I'm just gonna go home.                                                                       Orion: Aw, come on, don't say that.                                                                 Penelope: I've embarrassed myself enough for one night. I'll see you tomorrow, Orion. Say sorry to  Nova for me.                                                                                        Orion: Wait! (And... she left. Aaaaagh, what a fucking mess. I'm such a moron. I'd be mad too if    someone had ignored me like that just to try to hook up with someone I don't like. I'll have to     think of a way for her to forgive me... But anyway, let's go home. I don't feel like partying       anymore. This is not how I wanted to end the night, that's for sure... Oh, the college locker rooms Penny mentioned before. Oh, the college locker rooms. Hmm... there are no Halloween decorations in  here. It doesn't seem to be part of the party.) Um... *Whispering loudly* Penny? You there?         Penelope: ...Orion?                                                                                 Orion: Yeah, it's me! I thought you'd still be here after what happened earlier. Someone told me    you'd be here. Something about... a bucket full of beer?                                            Penelope: Are you alone?                                                                            Orion: Yep, there's only me here.                                                                   You hear a locker closing across the room.                                                          Penelope: Hey there!                                                                                Orion: Hey Penny!                                                                                   Penelope: Are you having fun?                                                                       Orion: I am! What about you, though? Are you okay? Will you be able to save your dress?             Penelope: Nah... it's all stained and sticky. And it smells awful. And look at my hair... ugh...    it's all greasy.                                                                                    Orion: Agh, I'm sorry to hear that... you were rocking the party with your Idriel costume. What a   bummer.                                                                                             Penelope: I'd like to think it was just bad luck, but... I know that Regina bitch isn't very fond of me. I'm sure she did that on purpose.                                                              Orion: Oh, yeah, I talked to her... I think she's jealous of you. Very jealous.                     Penelope: Huh, interesting way to channel her frustration.                                          Orion: What are you gonna do, then?                                                                 Penelope: Going back to the party, of course! That's not going to stop me. I have a dress in my     locker that I can wear. I mean, it's not a costume, but... it'll do the trick. *Sighs* And I'll have to shampoo my hair. It's completely ruined. I'll make myself a ponytail or something to muddle     through. This is gonna take a while, so don't worry about me. I'll join the party again when I'm    ready.                                                                                              Orion: Alright! We'll be around!                                                                    Penelope: So... did you need anything, or were you just missing me?                                 Orion: Oh, true! I almost forgot. Uh... it's a long story, but Nova and I joined a game that a weird guy with a painted-on mustache organized. There are some challenges, and the prize is a next-gen   processor. A really good one. The current challenge is finding a bra and bringing it back to him.   The team who gets the biggest one wins.                                                             Penelope: I see... And you thought of asking your big titty blonde bimbo friend to lend you hers,   right?                                                                                              Orion: *Laughs* You know I don't think that of you.                                                 Penelope: Of course, of course... Hmm... Agh, I thought I had my blue bra here. What have I done    with it...? I don't remember seeing it in my drawer at home... Mom must be taking my clothes again! Orion: Y-You and Nancy share your lingerie?                                                         Penelope: *Chuckles* She steals mine! She says she does it unintentionally because we use about the same cup size, but I'm not buying that!                                                             Orion: Oh boy...                                                                                    Penelope: Anyway, I just have this one. Will this do?                                               Orion: F-For sure... You don't need it?                                                             Penelope: Nah, don't worry. It's all yours.                                                         Orion: You know, you don't have to cover yourself. It's just me here...                             Penelope: *Giggles* I'm fine, thank you.                                                            Orion: Not even a little peek for your manager?                                                     Penelope: Nope. I don't want to distract you from this game of yours. And I need to wash my hair    before it's too late! See ya!                                                                       Orion: *Chuckles* You're evil. And after the game?                                                  Penelope: *Giggles* After the game? Who knows... The night is young... Goodbye, Orion!              Orion: *Chuckles* Bye, Penny... (Oh boy, she sure loves to tease me... Alright, I have the bra! Back to the cafeteria. Hmm... looks like Penelope isn't back yet. Maybe she's in the locker room? Hmm... Penelope isn't back yet. I'll go wait for her on that couch right there. Hmm... there's the girl   that dragged Penelope right off.)                                                                   Penelope: Hi there!                                                                                 Orion: Oh, hi there! *Laughs* I see you managed to escape your captor.                              Penelope: *Laughs* Yeah, she told me she's a follower of mine that started studying here this year. She just wanted a selfie together.                                                                  Orion: Problems of being Insta-famous!                                                              Penelope: *Chuckles* Problems of living in a small town where everyone knows each other and loves to gossip. But anyway, let me show you around! This is algebra class, and right in front of it you can find the locker rooms and the gym where the basketball team plays. If you look out the win–        A girl throws a bucket filled with some liquid all over Penelope.                                   Orion: What the fuck...                                                                             Penelope: W-W-Wha...                                                                                Regina: OH MY GOD, WHAT HAVE I DONE?! I'm so sorry, Penny! I lost my grip.                          Penelope: Regina...                                                                                 Regina: Oh my, I'm so clumsy... I ruined the dress of the prettiest girl at the university! You have no idea how bad I feel... Especially considering that the smell of beer doesn't leave so easily.   Penelope: WHAT?! This is beer?! Why are you carrying a bucket full of beer?                         Regina: One of the barrels at the other side of the building was broken, and we used this to collect what was pouring. I was taking it back to the cafeteria.                                           Penelope: Oh fuck, my hair is gonna stink all night!                                                Regina: Yeah... and get very sticky. That's too bad...                                              Penelope: That sure was a huge coincidence.                                                         Regina: I wish I could do something to remedy it, but... *Giggles* I guess it is what it is, huh?   Penelope: Yeah...                                                                                   Orion: Damn... I'm sorry, Penny. Can I help you somehow?                                            Penelope: No, don't worry... I'll... I'll go to my locker.                                          Orion: Will you be able to clean it?                                                                Penelope: I'll have to change my dress. This one will stink all night otherwise.                    Orion: You have to change your Idriel costume?!                                                     Penelope: Yeah, I should have something I can use in my locker, although... it won't be a costume.  And I'll have to wash my hair too. It’s a good thing I already got that Idriel pic for the IG       sponsor though.                                                                                     Orion: Damn, that sucks...                                                                          Penelope: Hey, I'm not backing out now. I came to this party to have fun, and that's what I'm still planning to do. I don't care what people think. Just let me go get cleaned up. You can wait for me  here, or check on Nova. I'll be right back!                                                         Orion: Okay then, alright! See you later!                                                           Regina: Oh, damn, how unfortunate for her. Poor, poor, Penelope.                                    Orion: ...You did that on purpose?                                                                  Regina: Oh please, not at all! As I said, it was just an unfortunate incident. *Checking you out*   But anyway, I don't think we've met before... Apollo?                                               Orion: Close, Eros. I'm Orion, I came with Penelope.                                                Regina: I see... Are you her... boyfriend?                                                          Orion: No, not really. We're just friends. I've been in Kredon just for a couple of months,         actually.                                                                                           Regina: Interesting. I like your style, Orion. You definitely deserve someone better than Penelope  to accompany you at this party.                                                                     Orion: Better than the most popular girl in college? That'll be hard to find.                       Regina: Well, that depends on whether you prefer a dumb, boring, walking piece of titty meat, or... something spicier.                                                                                  Orion: I'm sorry?                                                                                   Regina: Anyway, I should leave this bucket in the cafeteria. I'll see you around, Orion...          Orion: (Did this girl try to sabotage Penelope's costume on purpose? It sure looked like it... But  anyway, I guess I'll go wait for Penny to come back. Or... I could go see what Nova is doing. I     doubt Penny can get changed and wash her hair that quickly. Hmm... Penny doesn't seem to be here.   But that girl is the one who dragged her off. I'll go ask her.)                                     Regina: Hi, handsome.                                                                               Orion: *Turning around* Hmm? Oh, hello there...                                                     Regina: *Checking you out* I'm Regina. I don't think we've met before... Apollo?                    Orion: *Chuckles* Close! Eros. I'm Orion. Nice to meet you, Regina.                                 Regina: I see... Can I help you somehow, Orion?                                                     Orion: Actually, yeah! I'm looking for Penelope. Penelope Carter. Do you know her?                  Regina: Oh, of course I do! How could I not know the most popular girl in our beautiful town? She   just left. She had an unfortunate incident.                                                         Orion: What?! What happened?                                                                        Regina: She was super clumsy and accidentally ran into this bucket full of beer. She went to the    locker room to fix her pretty hair and get changed into something else. She'll have a terrible smell all night, poor girl.                                                                              Orion: ...The bucket you're holding right now? You did this?                                        Regina: Oopsie. I guess I was a little clumsy too, whoops.                                          Orion: You did that on purpose...?                                                                  Regina: Of course not! As I said, it was just an unfortunate incident. But... tell me a bit about   yourself. Are you her... boyfriend?                                                                 Orion: Um... no, not really. We're just friends. I've been in Kredon just for a couple of months.   Regina: Interesting. I like your style, Orion. You definitely deserve someone better than Penelope  to accompany you at this party.                                                                     Orion: *Chuckles* Better than the most popular girl in college? That'll be hard to find.            Regina: Well, that depends on whether you prefer a dumb, boring, walking piece of titty meat, or... something spicier.                                                                                  Orion: What...?                                                                                     Regina: Anyway, I should leave this bucket in the cafeteria. I'll see you around, Orion...          Orion: (Did this girl try to sabotage Penelope's costume on purpose? It sure sounded like it...     Anyway, I'll go check the locker room she mentioned. Or... I guess I could wait for her here, but if I do that I probably won't make it back to Nova in time.)                                          You prepare yourself a drink and spend some time greeting people.                                   Orion: *Sitting down* (Man, this could be my class next year. I've gotta get into this university by any means. With everything that has been happening lately, it's hard to focus on my studies, but I can't throw it all away now.)                                                                       Regina: Hi there!                                                                                   Orion: Hmm? Oh... hi. Regina, right?                                                                Regina: Yes. Good to see you, Orion. Are you having fun?                                            Orion: Sure am! The open bar is a killer.                                                           Regina: *Giggles* Be careful not to get too drunk... it's harder to keep track of free drinks than  ones you have to pay for.                                                                           Orion: *Chuckles* That's true.                                                                      Regina: What are you doing here all alone?                                                          Orion: Waiting for Penelope. She went to get changed and wash her hair. It's been a while already,  so she should appear at any moment.                                                                 Regina: Well... I wouldn't count on it, to be honest. You know how those Instagram girls are...     always superficial, only caring about how they look. She arrived with that pretty Idriel costume... and now she has to improvise a costume from a dress in her locker and a ponytail? I'd have gone home if I was in her shoes.                                                                             Orion: I don't know, she told me she'd join back after getting changed. I don't know, that would be very unlike her.                                                                                    Regina: Oh, and I honestly hope so. I'd like to see her wearing whatever she had in her locker...   Penelope: Well, lucky for you, you don't have to wait anymore, Regi. Hi, Orion! Sorry for the wait. Orion: Holy... fuck! Goddamn, this dress looks GREAT on you, Penny.                                 Penelope: Thank you! I wish I'd have had more time to get a fancier hairstyle or better makeup, but I'll muddle through with this.                                                                      Orion: “Muddle through”? You look spectacular.                                                      Regina: I see you reused the bracers from your other costume.                                       Penelope: Indeed. Thanks for noticing, Regi... Who'd have thought it'd look good with a normal dress too.                                                                                               Regina: Yeah, I guess that's the problem now... It's not a costume. Just a... normal dress. At a    costume party. It feels weird.                                                                      Penelope: *Passive-aggressive tone* Yeah... I used to have a good costume, remember? But because of that “incident”...                                                                                  Charlotte: OH. MY. GOD. Who cares if it's not a costume?! You look even better than in your pics!   Penelope: Aw, thank you, cutie.                                                                     Orion: (Hey... that's Charlotte, Axel's friend.) Charlotte?                                         Charlotte: Huh? Do I know you?                                                                      Orion: Come on, I've been in your class for weeks. I'm Orion. The new guy. Chang's friend.          Charlotte: Ahh... yeah... what are you doing here?                                                  Orion: I came with Penelope. I live with her, as part of the Student Exchange Program. What about   you? What are you doing here?                                                                       Charlotte: Uh... partying, duh. And I wanted to see Penelope. I'll be studying here next year, and  she's literally me, just... older. If I have to be the new most popular girl at this university next year, I've gotta take notes from my predecessor.                                                   Orion: Um... you and her are nothing alike, but... whatever. Where's Axel, by the way? I'm surprised you're not following him around like a puppy.                                                      Charlotte: Bah, don't talk to me about him. He's been ghosting me all week. He doesn't come to      school anymore, he doesn't reply to my messages, he's never online on his social media...           Orion: Wait, really? (It's true, though... I haven't seen him since the fancy dinner in Eternum.    Hmm... I've gotta ask Alex, perhaps she knows more. Maybe he's ill?)                                Charlotte: Chang turned out to be a fraud, Benjamin died, and now Axel vanished from school. What a shitty school year thus far.                                                                        Orion: Can't relate, to be honest. Mine's been the best one of my life, by far.                     Penelope: *Sitting next to you* Oh, really? And does that have something to do with us?             Orion: *Chuckles* I'd say the Carters played a big role in that, yeah...                            Penelope: Ah, that makes me feel accomplished.                                                      Regina: I was gonna sit there, Penelope.                                                            Penelope: Oh, really? I'm sorry, I must have missed the “reserved” sign. I hope you don't mind.     Regina: *Passive-aggressive tone* Of course not, girl. We're all friends here, and there's plenty of space.                                                                                             Penelope: Yeah, we are...                                                                           Regina: Now let's get wasted! This is a party, and I have an entire bottle of Jager right here,     ready to be drunk. Just be careful when you're grabbing the cups, you wouldn’t want your straps to  slip and suffer another wardrobe malfunction.                                                       Penelope: Any problem with my dress, sweetie?                                                       Regina: Not at all, darling. Very revealing. Definitely seems like your style.                      Penelope: Thanks, Mom, I'll keep it in mind.                                                        Orion: (Something tells me they don’t like each other much... I’d better not get in the middle of   this.) *Clears throat* I want a cup! *Laughs* W-What? Are you serious? You're a teacher?!           Professor Connor: Yeah, man. Teaching is like, my passion. And these students are my life. Just     don't tell the dean I'm smoking in here.                                                            Orion: *Chuckles* I won't, don't worry.                                                             Regina: Alright, guys, this was fun, but I wanna go dance before they turn out the lights.          Charlotte: Hell yeah! Let's decimate the dance floor.                                               Regina: We should play a game before going, though. To set the mood.                                Orion: Sure, sounds fun.                                                                            Regina: Let's do one final round of Truth or Dare. Each one of us can choose the person they want.  If they don't answer the question or don't perform the dare, they have to drink 3 shots.            Charlotte: I'm in!                                                                                  College Student: Sure!                                                                              Penelope: Should be fun.                                                                            Regina: Alright! I'll begin, then. And I choose... Orion. Truth... or dare?                         Orion: Um...                                                                                        Truth                                                                                               Orion: Truth.                                                                                       Regina: Okay... Tell me, Orion, how big are you?                                                    Orion: Um... do you mean...                                                                         Regina: You know what I mean.                                                                       Orion: Uhh... I don't really know, honestly. I've never measured it.                                Regina: All men have.                                                                               Orion: Well, not me.                                                                                Regina: Give us a guess.                                                                            Orion: Uh... Maybe like... 20 cm? 21?                                                               Regina: How much is that?                                                                           Orion: Oh... like... 8 inches? 8.5?                                                                 Penelope: . . .                                                                                     Charlotte: W-What?                                                                                  Regina: Come on, seriously. If you're embarrassed to say it, you can drink instead.                 Orion: I'm serious. Why would I lie? If you have a measuring tape I can go to the bathroom and tell you the exact length, if you want.                                                                  Regina: Wait... so you're not kidding?                                                              Orion: Nope.                                                                                        Regina: Boy, you've gotta be the palest Blacked actor I've seen. Holy fuck... I guess that's why    Penelope likes you.                                                                                 Penelope: S-Shut up, Regina. I haven't even seen it yet.                                            Regina: Yet?                                                                                        Penelope: Uhh... I-I mean... Alright, who's next? Let's continue!                                   Dare                                                                                                Orion: Dare.                                                                                        Regina: Okay... You have to kiss... Penelope on the neck.                                           Orion: Ohh... this is the kind of dare I like.                                                      Penelope: *Giggles* I bet you do.                                                                   Orion: It's my time to shine. Please, stand up, m'lady. *Grabbing her by the waist* I love this     dress, Penny. The incident with the beer doesn't seem like such a tragedy anymore.                  Penelope: Thanks. You... smell good.                                                                Orion: Ah, my $50 cologne is paying off already! Do you want to take a closer sniff?                Penelope: *Chuckles* Show me, stud.                                                                 You approach Penelope and start giving her small, gentle kisses on her neck, slowly moving up and   down.                                                                                               Penelope: (God, this is so hot. I wonder if he's kissed many girls. He's really good at this...)    You start alternating between tiny nibbles and wide kisses using your tongue, but making sure not to leave a hickey.                                                                                    Penelope: Mmmm...                                                                                   Regina: (Huh, I thought she'd refuse. So the bitch really likes him, eh? Interesting...) Okay, okay, that's enough! Stop before you get every girl in here all wet, Eros.                               Orion: How did I do?                                                                                Penelope: Not bad at all... At least an 8. Maybe a 9.                                               Orion: Hmm... I'll have to keep practicing, then. I need to achieve perfection.                     Regina: Okay, guys, let's continue playing!                                                         Penelope: Who's next?                                                                               Regina: Let’s go with you. Choose someone.                                                          Penelope: Me? Mmmm... I'll go with Professor Connor. He's still such a mystery to all of us. Truth  or dare, professor?                                                                                 Professor Connor: Uh... imma go with truth. I'm too old for dares.                                  Penelope: Okay... There's a rumor that says that you slept with Dean Meyers. I need to know, is that true?                                                                                              Professor Connor: *Laughs* If I answer that, my job would be at risk, Penelope.                     Penelope: Ah! Don't worry, that answered my question sufficiently.                                  Regina: I won't be able to look at her the same way.                                                Professor Connor: Let's keep this between us, guys.                                                 Penelope: Don't worry, sir, if no one snitched that you smoke joints during your lessons, no one    will say a word about this either.                                                                  Professor Connor: I appreciate it.                                                                  Charlotte: Aight, it's my turn! I choose Penelope!                                                  Penelope: Alright... I'm gonna say... truth.                                                        Charlotte: Okay! Here's my question: if you had to do a threesome with 2 people at this party right now, who would you choose?                                                                          Penelope: A t-threesome? And with someone in the university right now...?                           Charlotte: Yeah!                                                                                    Penelope: And do I have to say 2 boys?                                                              Charlotte: Not necessarily. Whatever you'd like!                                                    Penelope: *Giggles* Alright... In that case I'm gonna say... Nova...                                Orion: (Hot...)                                                                                     Penelope: And...                                                                                    Regina: Who's Nova?                                                                                 Orion: You don't know her? She studies here too. She usually wears an eyepatch, long curly ginger   hair... You saw her by the entrance when we arrived!                                                College Student: Me? Ah, yeah, the girl cosplaying as Jinx, right?                                  Orion: Yes!                                                                                         Charlotte: What's a Jinx?                                                                           College Student: A character from League of Legends.                                                Charlotte: The fuck is League of Legends?                                                           Regina: I remember that. Isn't it one of those ancient video games people used to play before       Eternum came out?                                                                                   Orion: Well, technically, she's cosplaying as Jinx from Arcane, the Netflix show, not the game.     College Student: Did you see last season? It was crazy good! When Vi goes to the-                   Charlotte: Whatever, I don't care. Let's go back to my question. This Nova and...?                  Penelope: My friend Lily and... Hmm... Who else could I say...                                      Orion: *Chuckles* I swear if you don't say my name, I'm gonna grab my things and go home.           Penelope: *Snorts* Okay, okay, I'm gonna say Orion. Just don't let it get to your head.             Orion: Penelope Carter just said that she'd like to have a threesome with me. It's difficult not to be enthusiastic.                                                                                    Penelope: I had to say someone. It's just a game.                                                   Orion: *Chuckles* Hey, don't ruin my mood!                                                          Regina: Okay, professor, it's your turn.                                                            Professor Connor: Oh, me? I'm gonna choose... Orion. I want to get to know my possible future       students better. What is it gonna be, my boy?                                                       Truth                                                                                               Orion: Let's go with truth.                                                                         Professor Connor: Alright. I don't know what the deal is with you young kids these days, so let me  ask you... Have you ever made love to a girl during her bleeding days?                              Orion: Damn! Uh... no, never have, no.                                                              Penelope: Would you do it, though?                                                                  Orion: Have sex with a girl on her period?                                                          Penelope: Mm-hm. A girl comes to you horny as fuck wanting to give you the ride of your life, but   she says she's on her period. What would you say?                                                   Orion: I'd say...                                                                                   Let's do it                                                                                         Orion: You better have a spare change of sheets, girl, because we're gonna leave a big fucking      mess...                                                                                             Penelope: *Snorts* You're a dirty, horny, fucking dog.                                              Orion: I'm not scared to get my hands dirty. And what's not to like? Extra lube and I get to fulfill my vampire fantasies. My future self would worry about the cleaning. Don't you like to get carried away sometimes?                                                                                     Penelope: Can't say I don't like to sometimes, yeah...                                              No, thanks                                                                                          Orion: I'd politely decline and arrange a new meeting. I'm a gentleman. I’d set up a time where we  can both be satisfied. And maybe throw in a little extra for missing the first appointment.         Penelope: Oh my, chivalry isn't dead after all...                                                   Orion: Not while I'm still around.                                                                  Dare                                                                                                Orion: Let's go with dare.                                                                          Professor Connor: Good choice. Orion, I dare you to eat one of my magic mushrooms.                  Orion: *Laughs* Magic mushrooms?                                                                    Professor Connor: Hand-picked in the Brazilian Amazon. Eating a few of them can take you on a trip  that some people describe as a religious experience. The indigenous people claimed they allowed you to get in touch with your own soul and even speak with the gods.                                    Orion: Um... I appreciate it, but I think I'm gonna pass.                                           Professor Connor: Don't worry, just eat one. The effects are immediate, but only last a couple of   minutes, at most. You'll see more vibrant colors and deeper shadows. You’ll feel more relaxed during that time, and after that there are no side effects.                                               Orion: Uh... well, okay then, in that case... I'll try it. And I have to eat it all at once?        Professor Connor: Yes, sir. Just eat it, close your eyes, and count to ten.                         Orion: Alright, I guess I can trust a professor of the University of Kredon. Aaaah...               You swallow the mushroom without chewing.                                                           Professor Connor: Now keep your eyes closed for a minute and let your mind go blank.                Orion: (Hmm, it's true that I feel something. Like a... slight dizziness. How can it take effect so fast, though? Maybe it's absorbed through the taste buds? Hmm, well, it doesn't seem to be anything I can't handle so far.)                                                                             Professor Connor: You can open your eyes.                                                           Orion: *Taking a deep breath* Hmm...                                                                Penelope: Do you feel anything different, Orion?                                                    Orion: Uh... T-This feels a bit stronger than what you told me, Professor.                          Professor Connor: Yeah, the first time always hits a bit harder. But after a while it barely affects you. We used to eat dozens of them every night when I was young.                                   Penelope: Do you want a glass of water, Orion?                                                      Orion: N-No... I'm fine, actually! Haha!                                                            Penelope: Oh... well, alright, then.                                                                Orion: Your tits look huuuuuge with this dress, Penny, did I tell you? They're moving with such a   hypnotic dance...                                                                                   Penelope: ...Moving?                                                                                Regina: Haha, is he really hallucinating?                                                           Orion: H-Hey, your tits are dancing too, Regina.                                                    Regina: I wanna try one of these mushrooms.                                                         Orion: I wouldn't recommend it, honestly. It feels waaaaay too trippy. How long did you say the     effects lasted, Professor Connor? Huh...? Heeeyy... Where did everyone go? Is the party over        already? I guess we're alone now, Penny... Oh... Haha, now I see you with your Idriel costume again! Crazy...                                                                                           Idriel: You need to go back, Orion.                                                                 Orion: W-What? You have her voice too...                                                            Idriel: Eternum is calling you.                                                                     Orion: Wait... what is going on... Is this the bleeding effect again? Like the gas station with     Luna?                                                                                               Idriel: You have to remember.                                                                       Orion: AAAAAH! Aww shit, I might need that glass of water now, Penny.                               Idriel: They need your help, Orion.                                                                 Orion: W-What? Who?                                                                                 Idriel: If you had to toss a coin a hundred times... And it came up heads 99 times... What would you bet on for the last throw?                                                                         Orion: What? This again?                                                                            Idriel: What would you bet on?                                                                      Orion: Uh...                                                                                        Heads                                                                                               Orion: Heads again, of course.                                                                      Idriel: You still don't understand, Orion.                                                          Tails                                                                                               Orion: Tails.                                                                                       Idriel: You’re beginning to understand, Orion. You must look beyond. Break. The. Chains.            Orion: AAAH! W-What the fuck?!                                                                      Penelope: Are you okay, Orion?                                                                      Orion: *Laughs* I mean... y-yeah, I am! This shit is insane! Holy fuck, what a trip. I saw tons of  colors and weird shit. You're a crazy bastard, Connor.                                              Professor Connor: *Laughs* I get that a lot. Before you ask, I don't have any more magic mushrooms, I'm sorry.                                                                                          Orion: *Chuckles* I wasn't planning to eat any more, don't worry.                                   Regina: Are you good to continue, then?                                                             Orion: S-Sure! *Taking a sip* I just need another shot to get back to reality.                      College Student: My turn, my turn! I wanna ask Penelope!                                            Regina: *Sighs* How original.                                                                       Penelope: Uh... I'm gonna say truth again...                                                        College Student: That works! I wanna ask... Where is the weirdest place you've ever jilled off?!    Penelope: Jilled off? Uh... I should stop drinking before I reveal something I shouldn't...         Orion: Nonsense. You're doing fine. And I really wanna hear that story.                             Penelope: *Giggles* Okay... but I'll keep it short. I guess it was probably... in a jacuzzi.        Orion: Oh. That's hot. Nothing out of the ordinary, though.                                         Penelope: Well... I was in the jacuzzi with Mom and Dalia.                                          Orion: OKAY, now this is getting interesting... Can you go into specifics?                          Penelope: The three of us went to a spa like 3 years ago, for my 18th birthday. There was this hot  tub in the women's baths, and we were all chilling there, relaxing in the water. Then I put my legs over the side of the hot tub in an attempt to get more comfortable and... I found a water jet.      Orion: Oh god...                                                                                    Penelope: *Giggles* I knew I should have stopped, but god, it just felt too good... I orgasmed 2    times without any of them noticing. I had to cover my mouth with my hands.                          Orion: Oh my, that's so fucking HOT. Can't wait to tell Dalia and Nancy...                          Penelope: *Snorts* I'd kill you.                                                                    Regina: Okay, okay, fascinating story. Lots of questions, and very few dares. Booooring. There's    only Orion left, so let's do only dares now! I don't know about you, but I think people in this     party are wearing way too many clothes...                                                           Orion: You're not wrong there, Regina...                                                            Regina: So... who are you daring?                                                                   Orion: Hmm...                                                                                       Penelope                                                                                            Orion: *Looking at Penelope* Who could I choose...                                                  You stare directly at Penelope's huge attributes.                                                   Penelope: I'm not gonna get naked in front of everyone, Orion.                                      Orion: Not naked, the dare is just flashing your tits.                                              Penelope: Not now, and not with 10 more beers.                                                      Orion: Let me finish! AND not in front of everyone. You have to flash your tits to someone. The     person you choose. Someone sitting around this table.                                               Penelope: Ah, of course... And I can choose?                                                        Orion: Totally up to you.                                                                           Penelope: Mm-hm... Okay, I can do that. And I'm gonna choose Charlotte.                             Charlotte: What?! Really?                                                                           Orion: *Laughs* You're not really gonna do this to me, right?                                       Penelope: I feel more comfortable doing something like this with a girl. Nothing personal.          Orion: *Chuckles* You're enjoying teasing me so much tonight, aren't you?                           Penelope: *Giggles* You don't know how much.                                                        Penelope stands up and goes with Charlotte to a corner of the classroom.                            Penelope: *Giggles* God, I can't believe I'm really doing this.                                     Charlotte: Don't worry, I know what it’s like to be the most popular girl in school. Everyone wants to see you naked. Everyone wants to be with you. You chose the right person.                        Penelope: Alright, there we go. A dare is a dare...                                                 Orion: (Aw man, I wish I could be on the other side... She's not even wearing a bra...)             Penelope: *Putting the top of her dress back on* Oh god, this was embarrassing! *Sitting down*      Alright, I guess this ends the game.                                                                Charlotte: . . . H-How can they be so big and so perky at the same time? W-why doesn't gravity      affect her? What cruel fate is this...?                                                             Regina                                                                                              Orion: I'm gonna choose... you, Regina. And here's my dare: You have to flash your tits.            Regina: Hah. In front of everyone?                                                                  Orion: Oh, no, just... in front of the person you choose.                                           Regina: The person I choose, huh?                                                                   Orion: Mm-hm.                                                                                       Regina: *Giggles* Alright, cutie, let's go to that corner.                                          Orion: Oh shit, are you gonna do it?                                                                Regina: A dare is a dare...                                                                         Regina stands up and goes with you to a corner of the classroom.                                    Regina: You're such a pervert, Orion, did you know that?                                            Orion: Hey, it was you who complained that the game was getting boring.                             Regina: Touché.                                                                                     Regina unzips her vest and takes it off entirely.                                                   Orion: Goddammit...                                                                                 Regina: Enjoying what you see?                                                                      Orion: Very much, yes... Can I touch?                                                               Regina: Oh my, this boy sounds thirsty!                                                             Penelope: What is he supposed to do when you're practically putting your boobs in his face?         Regina: Someone sounds jealous...                                                                   Penelope: Jealous of a skank showing her tits to a guy she’s known for an hour?? Not really, no.    Orion: You're hot, Regina. And your nipples are so pointy...                                        Regina: Thank you, Orion. We have to leave it here for now, but... let’s see where the night takes  us.                                                                                                 Penelope: Are you done back there? I wanna leave for the dance floor already. I guess this ends the game, doesn't it?                                                                                   Regina: *Sitting down* Yes, it does.                                                                Charlotte                                                                                           Orion: I'm gonna go with Charlotte. And here's my dare: You have to flash your tits!                Charlotte: Excuse me? In front of everyone? I'm not doing that.                                     Orion: No, not in front of everyone. Just one person.                                               Charlotte: Ah, I see where this is going... You want to see the most popular girl in school naked.  The classic nerd fantasy. Alright, Orion... I'm drunk, and it's your lucky day. Let's do it.        Charlotte stands up and goes with you to a corner of the classroom.                                 Charlotte: Okay, Orion... I'll let it pass for now because you're kinda cute, but if you tell anyone at school about this, I'll ruin your life. Understood?                                             Orion: Mm-hm.                                                                                       Charlotte lifts her top to leave her boobs exposed.                                                 Charlotte: *Giggles* Enjoy the view.                                                                Orion: . . . . . . (Jesus Christ, why do they sag so much? They almost hang down to her belly       button. And are those... wrinkles??)                                                                Charlotte: *Going back to the couch* Okay, okay! That's enough! *Giggles* You're welcome for the    dreams you're gonna have about this!                                                                Orion: *Shivers* (Oh god, I really fucking hope not. It would be my worst nightmare. I won't doubt  Dalia and Alex ever again.)                                                                         Penelope: I guess this ends the game, doesn't it?                                                   Regina: Yes, it does.                                                                               Professor Connor: This was fun, kids. These parties always make me feel young again.                Regina: Thank you for joining us, Professor. And again, sorry for losing this cohort's yearbook, on behalf of all students.                                                                             Professor Connor: No worries... it's all good.                                                      Penelope: Thank you for reminding us about the missing yearbook every day, Regina.                  Regina: It's the least I can do.                                                                    Orion: Hmm? A yearbook? What's this about?                                                          Penelope: The University of Kredon has this tradition where they publish a yearbook with photos,    signatures and notes from all the students. It’s passed from hand to hand until everyone has added  something.                                                                                          Regina: And Penelope lost it.                                                                       Penelope: Someone stole it from my bag.                                                             Regina: Don't worry, sweetie, no one is holding it against you. Being a little forgetful isn’t the  worst thing in the world. Besides, it fits with the old ditsy blonde stereotype, haha.              Penelope: SOMEONE STOLE IT.                                                                         Regina: Whatever you say... Anyway, I'll go see what music's playing in the main hall. See y’all    later!                                                                                              Charlotte: I'm going with you!                                                                      College Student: Me too!                                                                            Penelope: *Standing up* Yeah, I think I'm gonna head back home now.                                 Orion: Really? So quickly? *Looking at your phone* Oh, damn, it's 2:30 AM already. Time really flew by. Alright then, let's go look for Nova and head back home! Alright then, let's go back home!      Penelope: No, no, don't worry, you can stay. I'll see you at home.                                  Orion: No way I'm staying here without you. You're the reason I came in the first place.            Penelope: Seriously, stay. I just feel like taking the scenic route on the way home. I don't mind,  really.                                                                                             Orion: . . . Scenic route? At 2:30 AM? I know you well enough to know you're up to something.       Penelope: I'm not up to anything. I’m a good girl.                                                  Orion: Penny...                                                                                     Penelope: . . . Okay, it's about that damn yearbook.                                                Orion: I knew it!                                                                                   Penelope: I KNOW it was Regina who stole it to make me look bad. She's been fucking with me all     year. All 3 years of college, really! I'm going to her dorm to retrieve it. It has to be there.     Orion: Why are you so certain that she has it?                                                      Penelope: Well... I have no evidence, but I have a gut feeling. I know it was her. I saw her        sneering smirk when the dean chastised me about losing the book. And if it's not there... I'm sure  I’ll find a clue or something.                                                                      Help her                                                                                            Orion: Come on, Penny. Whether she took it or not... do you really think revenge gets you anywhere? Penelope: Yes.                                                                                      Orion: Yeah, I’m fucking with you, I don’t like that girl either. I don’t think taking the high road will work on someone like her. Let's get that bitch.                                               Penelope: *Giggles* I knew I could count on you.                                                    Orion: Always. And be honest... you like it when I play the bad boy.                                Penelope: *Giggles* I'll admit it's kinda sexy.                                                     Orion: What's the plan, then?                                                                       Penelope: Meet me by the stairs of the main hall. The dorm building is right beside the one we're in right now.                                                                                         Orion: Gotcha. See you there! (Oh boy, I got up too fast... my head's spinning. Between beers,      Akira's wine, shots, long drinks, and those damn mushrooms... Between beers, Akira's wine, shots,   and long drinks... Between beers, shots, and long drinks... My stomach is begging for a break. Only water until next month...)                                                                          Regina: Where are you going so fast?                                                                Orion: Hmm? Oh, I thought you left to dance.                                                        Regina: I thought of a better activity.                                                             Orion: A better activity?                                                                           Regina: Something we could both do... together.                                                     Orion: What do you mean...?                                                                         Regina: Well, you can continue following Penelope like a puppy, like everyone else, doing what she  wants and telling her how pretty she is all the time... Or you can come with me to the locker room  and do something you’ll never forget.                                                               Orion: Uh... are you proposing that we...                                                           Regina: You're hot, Orion. I’m hot. And... I'm horny. Let's just enjoy this party together. What do you say?                                                                                            Orion: Um... just to be clear, when you say “something you’ll never forget”, do you mean...         Regina: I mean that I'd let you fuck me so hard that I’d need a walking stick tomorrow.             Orion: *Gulps* Damn.                                                                                Regina: 10 minutes. You and me. The locker room. And Penelope won’t find out, don't worry. I'll be  there waiting for you...                                                                            Orion: (Damn... Regina wants to shag me! I'm getting real lucky with the ladies this year. Now I can score with college ladies without even trying! Maybe this new cologne really is the chick magnet it was advertised as.)                                                                                Discourage her from doing it                                                                        Orion: Come on, Penny. We're better than that. Whether she really took it or not... revenge gets you nowhere.                                                                                           Penelope: Baaaahh, really? Don't be such a bore! Where did you leave your spine, Orion?             Orion: I don't need to play the bad boy. And neither do you. It doesn't suit you.                   Penelope: You used to be way cooler... *Sighs* But you're probably right. I’m just being too rash. I guess I'll go home for real.                                                                       Orion: You made the right decision.                                                                 Penelope: If you still want to accompany me...                                                      Orion: *Chuckles* Gladly. Let's go find Nova. (Alright... the locker room. I have a few minutes     before Penelope or Nova start missing me... I wonder if Regina was actually serious or if she was   just messing with me.)                                                                              Regina: Hi, handsome.                                                                               You turn around and see Regina standing behind you, swaying her hips in a slow, sensual way.        Orion: Oh boy... (I guess she was serious after all...) Looking good, Regina.                       Regina: Thank you... you too.                                                                       Orion: So... tell me, what did you have in mind?                                                    Regina: Oh my, wasn't I sufficiently clear? I want you to fuck me, Orion.                           Orion: Oh fuck yes...                                                                               Regina: We don't have much time, though... You'll have to strive for it. Just... don't worry about  me. I can handle... anything...                                                                     Orion: O-Oh god... I'm gonna make a mess out of you. Come here, baby...                             Regina: Ah, ah, ah, not so fast! I want you to get naked for me first. Let's see what you're hiding under there...                                                                                      Orion: With pleasure...                                                                             You hastily remove your robes and throw them against the wall. Your cock starts getting hard in     anticipation.                                                                                       Regina: Jesus fucking Christ... You really weren't kidding during the truth or dare game... I can   see why Penny is so interested in you...                                                            Orion: To be fair she hasn't even seen me naked yet. Well, not hard, at least. But... wait, she's   interested? What do you know? Did she tell you anything?                                            Regina: Don't get distracted on me now, boy. Do you want me to milk that cock of yours or not?      Orion: Oh, fuck yes, I do...                                                                        Regina: Turn around then...                                                                         Orion: What for?                                                                                    Regina: Trust me, no one has ever done something like this to you before...                         You do as Regina says and turn around.                                                              Orion: Oh my god...                                                                                 Regina: The question here is, do you really know how to make a girl roll her eyes upwards? A big    dick is good for nothing if you don't know how to use it.                                           Orion: Oh, trust me, you're gonna...                                                                You hear the sound of a phone taking pictures.                                                      Orion: Huh...? *Turning around* What the hell...                                                    Regina: Damn boy, what an erection. You really were horny, eh?                                      Orion: What the fuck are you doing?!                                                                Regina: Taking pictures of you.                                                                     Orion: What for?                                                                                    Regina: To send them to Penelope.                                                                   Orion: What?! Are you out of your fucking mind?! You told me she wouldn't find out about this!      Regina: *Snorts* Yeah, well, I also said we were gonna fuck and we're not gonna, so...              Orion: You're a fucking bitch! Why are you doing this?!                                             Regina: I could explain it to you, but if you have to ask that you're too stupid to understand it.  And I don't really have the time. It was fun, though. Think of this as... your freshman initiation  prank! You just got one a year earlier. Lucky you!                                                  Orion: You're such a cunt.                                                                          Regina: *Snorts* Whatever, I'll let you get on with your things. *Giggles* God, can't wait to see   Penelope's face! Take care, Orion, I'll see you around. Welcome to the University of Kredon!        Orion: (Aw, man... What a mess. Thinking about it, though... I really was stupid. Goddammit, Orion.) *Sighs* (I should get out of here and go look for Penny.) Hello there! I couldn't help noticing you were sitting here all alone, babe. Can I buy you a drink?                                          Penelope: *Giggles* I'm sorry, I'm waiting for someone.                                             Orion: Oh, my bad. Your boyfriend, I'm guessing?                                                    Penelope: Not really, no... Just a friend who's gonna help me sneak into the dorm room of someone   who stole something from me. A mission to regain my honor, you could say.                           Orion: Oh, damn, that sounds exciting! That guy sounds like a real Prince Charming! I don’t see him anywhere though... You know what? I'll help you. Fuck that dude you were waiting for, whoever he    was.                                                                                                Penelope: *Giggles* Alright... I like you, mysterious stranger. I accept your help.                 Orion: *Chuckles* Do you know where Regina’s dorm is?                                               Penelope: Yeah, it's in a dorm building by the entrance of the campus. Most people will be at the   party right now, and the ones who didn't come or left already must be sleeping or hooking up, so... we should have free rein.                                                                           Orion: Alright then, let's go! You lead the way. Hmm, you were right, there's no one here.          Penelope: Told you! And we'll have returned to the party before anyone misses us. It's the perfect  crime.                                                                                              Orion: Which one’s Regina's room?                                                                   Penelope: It's the second door on the left. People here don't lock doors when they're out partying  because they usually come back drunk as skunks.                                                     Orion: You seem to know a lot about these dorms.                                                    Penelope: Yeah, I used to stay over at my friend Lily’s dorm during finals weeks or longer parties. I also looked into them before starting college, but having Mom's house less than 30 minutes away?  No chance! And I know we're always at each other's throats, but I'm sure Dalia would miss me too    much.                                                                                               Orion: And wouldn't you miss her as well?                                                           Penelope: Uh... Honestly? A lot. More than what I'd ever admit in front of her.                     Orion: *Chuckles* (They're more alike than they realize.)                                           Penelope: *Whispering* Now quiet. *Whispering* We don't know if her roommate is in the room.        Orion: *Whispering* Is it this one?                                                                 Penelope: *Whispering* Yeah. *Whispering* But I don't hear anything. I think it's empty.            *Whispering* Let's just shoot for it.                                                               Orion: *Whispering* I got your back.                                                                Penelope: Nice! It's empty!                                                                         Orion: Sweet!                                                                                       Penelope: *Turning the light on* Okay, I'll lock the door from the inside, just in case. Take a look at drawers and shelves, the yearbook has to be here!                                               Orion: Hmm... Regina's room looks way more “girly” than I imagined. Maybe it's because of her       roommate?                                                                                           Penelope: I doubt it. She just does this because it's what sells on social media nowadays. *Puffs* I mean, look at this. “Not all those who wander are lost.” “Do more of what makes you happy.”        “Believe in your dreams. They know the way.” Wow... those are some inspirational lines! I've just   heard them... ...like a thousand times before. Find a new source to steal quotes from, Regina. Maybe if you were a bit more original, you'd get those followers you yearn for.                          Orion: Original, huh? Something like the pic of Carolyn wearing a mini witch hat that you posted the other day? Is that the key to being a successful influencer?                                       Penelope: *Laughs* More or less, yeah. Can you believe that became one of my most liked pics?       Orion: Carolyn is just too photogenic. It was such a great pic. Probably my favorite of yours. I    mean from the ones on your Instagram profile, of course. My absolute favorites are still the ones   from our private session...                                                                         Penelope: Hah. I bet they are... Maybe we'll have to do another photo shoot some day.               Orion: Nothing would please me more...                                                              Penelope: We might not be able to use the studio this time, after the Valentino incident. We’d      probably have to settle for another one, or just shoot at the house. I have a pretty good spot set  up in my bedroom, too...                                                                            Orion: Sounds good...                                                                               Penelope: All in good time, though. Let's do what we came to do.                                    Orion: Y-Yeah, of course!                                                                           Penelope: Someone could appear at any moment, so we should leave this place ASAP. Take a look at    that bookcase over there, I'll go through the drawers.                                              Orion: On it! *Squatting* What exactly are we looking for?                                          Penelope: Uhh... well, it looks like any other book. Like... a foot long, brown cover.              Orion: There're only normal books here. “If it fits, I sits”? Hmmmm...                              Penelope: I have that book! It's a phrase used as a caption for photos of cats sitting in unusual   locations.                                                                                          Orion: Oh. I'll admit that's not what was running through my head...                                Penelope: *Kneeling down* Orion! Look at this! This drawer has a lock on it!                        Orion: Hmm...                                                                                       Penelope: They must keep all their valuable things here. The yearbook has to be there!              Orion: So... dead end?                                                                              Penelope: What do you mean? We just have to open it!                                                Orion: How?                                                                                         Penelope: Uhh... aren't you like, super strong? Can't you just rip it out?                          Orion: ...I don't think I can.                                                                      Penelope: Maybe using a crowbar?                                                                    Orion: Or... we could take the entire drawer. And then open it at home.                             Penelope: Interesting... That might be the best option. Can you rip the entire drawer out?          Orion: I can try.                                                                                   Penelope: Let's do it.                                                                              Regina: What? Goddammit, Bella locked the door again? *Sighs* Now where the fuck did I put my       keys...                                                                                             Penelope: *Whispering* F-fuck, Regina's back!                                                       Orion: *Whispering* What is she doing here?! The party isn't over yet!                              Penelope: *Whispering* I don't know, maybe she came back to grab something. *Whispering* S-She can't find us here, Orion! *Whispering* She's friends with the dean, she'll get me expelled and bar you  from getting into this university next year!                                                        Orion: *Whispering* Shit, w-what do we do?                                                          Penelope: *Whispering* T-The window! *Whispering* Let's jump!                                       Orion: *Whispering* Are you crazy?! It's the third floor!                                           Penelope: *Whispering* T-Then let's hide inside the wardrobe!                                       Orion: *Whispering* But that shit is too small!                                                     Penelope: *Whispering* Then crouch down! Please!                                                    Orion: *Whispering* But–                                                                            Regina: Huh?? What the hell? She even left the lights on. What a mess. (Anyway, let's get rid of    that shit. That bitch is beginning to suspect.)                                                     Regina opens the drawer and takes out a book from inside.                                           Regina: (I'll just dump it in the river or something before someone finds it.)                      Penelope: *Whispering* I knew it! *Whispering* That's the yearbook! I knew it was her who took it!  *Whispering* Fucking cunt.                                                                          Orion: (God, this is such an awkward pose. Although... Penny's literally resting her butt against my hips. I don't have any complaints there.)                                                          Regina: *Sitting down* (I can't believe I just got stood up. Everyone's just a bunch of             ass-kissers.)                                                                                       Penelope: *Whispering* Tsk, is she really gonna use her phone now?                                  Orion: (She smells so good...)                                                                      Penelope: *Whispering* I'm sorry I dragged you into this, Orion. *Whispering* Are you okay back     there?                                                                                              Orion: *Whispering* Y-Yeah, I'll have some soreness tomorrow from holding this pose for too long,   and some hanger's poking me in the back, but... *Whispering* Apart from that, I'm good.             Regina: (Hmm, Ginny uploaded a photo of herself from tonight. Look at how everyone is drooling in   the comments. Bunch of retards.)                                                                    Penelope: *Whispering* Come on, leave already...                                                    Orion: (Fuck, Penny’s ass is getting me hard. If I don't move she shouldn't notice it in this pose, though. Please, don't move...                                                                       Regina: Bah, let's go back to the party.) *Stands up* (But let's get rid of this thing first.) Say  goodbye to your reputation, Penny.                                                                  Penelope: Finally! I think she left, Orion! Phew, that was close!                                   Orion: C-Cool, just be careful when going out, there's a...                                         Penelope: *Opens the wardrobe door* O-Oh SHIT!                                                      Orion: B-Be careful with– Ouch... A-Are you okay?                                                   Penelope: *Laughs* Hahaha!                                                                          Orion: *Chuckles* What are you laughing at?                                                         Penelope: *Chuckles* Nothing, I'm just laughing at the absurdity of this situation. Oh god... At    this point I don't care about Regina anymore. I don't even care about that damn yearbook. Honestly? I just want to spend time with you doing cra... C-Crazy... *Jumping up* Orion!!                     Orion: What?                                                                                        Penelope: Y-Your toga! Y-You're...                                                                  Orion: Huh? *Awkward laugh* Oh... erm... shit. *Standing up* It's just that... that wardrobe was way too small, and...                                                                                  Penelope: W-Where are your underpants? Have you been going commando all night?                      Orion: Um... yeah, I didn't want them to ruin my costume.                                           Penelope: . . . My fucking god, Orion, you're hung like a fucking horse. That cock is a weapon! I   thought you were messing with Regina when she asked you how big you were. Now I think you were      underselling it.                                                                                    Orion: Uh? But you stared at me before the party. In the shower. Didn't you?                        Penelope: Well, y-yeah, but you weren't hard. And you were in the shower. There must have been...   shrinkage or something, I don't know. Now it's like... three times the size.                        Orion: I-I've just been trying to keep it in check all night. But it doesn’t help that you’ve been  teasing me, Penny... And the fact that you can't take your eyes off it isn't helping either...      Actually, it's turning me on even more.                                                             Penelope: *Laughs* EXCUSE ME? Now your donkey dick is my fault?                                     Orion: Oh, absolutely. Our conversation in the bathroom, the locker room when I asked you for a bra, the truth or dare game... First the locker room when I asked you for a bra, then the truth or dare game... First our conversation in the bathroom, then the truth or dare game... I even dared you to  flash me, and you snaked your way around that! You ruined the sanctity of Truth or Dare, in my      opinion. It’s like you’re trying to set a world record for bluest balls! Pretty rude to your        manager, if you ask me. I might have to shelve you for my other clients...                          Penelope: *Giggles* What other clients? And it's not my fault that you're a horny dog. Are you      telling me that I'm to blame for you getting an erection at awkward moments? I don’t think it’s my  fault that you can’t control yourself around me...                                                  Orion: It’s your fault, a hundred percent. It's been like torture.                                  Penelope: *Giggles* Oh my, I had no idea you were suffering this much, baby! I'm so sorry.          Orion: Nuh-uh, I don't forgive you.                                                                 Penelope: *Chuckles* Pretty please... Orion?                                                        Orion: Nope.                                                                                        Penelope: Come on... Isn’t there anything I can do for you to forgive me? I’m so very sorry for     flaunting my lewd body in front of you, Orion. I had no idea it would cause you so much stress...   Orion: (I like where this is going...) Well, as compensation for all the teasing that you've made me go through... What if you let me see what you’re hiding under that dress...?                       Penelope: You want to see me naked? The photoshoot wasn’t enough for you, perv?                     Orion: Oh, but now it's different. That day was strictly professional. I was just performing my due diligence as a prospective manager.                                                                 Penelope: And today?                                                                                Orion: Today it's... a personal request.                                                            Penelope: A personal request, huh?                                                                  Orion: Just a quick boobie flash! That's all I’m asking for.                                        Penelope: And what's in it for me?                                                                  Orion: Hmm... my forgiveness?                                                                       Penelope: *Snorts* Hmm.                                                                             Orion: And the possibility to keep working with the most respected manager in Kredon. It's a pretty sweet deal, if you ask me.                                                                          Penelope: Hmm. Here?                                                                                Orion: Here...                                                                                      Penelope: Okay, superstud... you’ve convinced me. I guess you have a point. I really wouldn’t want  to risk upsetting my manager... *Giggles* And honestly? The truth is that I've definitely been      teasing you for quite a bit... and it’s been very, VERY fun.                                        Orion: (Oh yes... FINALLY!)                                                                         Penelope: Okay, take a good look, Orion. It won't last...                                           Penelope slips off the top of her dress, her bare breasts heaving before your eyes.                 Orion: Oh, fuck yes... I'd forgotten how perfect they were, Penny. I suspected you weren't wearing a bra when I saw you in that dress. With tits like yours, you wouldn’t even need one.                Penelope: Happy now, Mr. Richards? Do you forgive me for acting naughty? For being such a tease? For flaunting myself all around you?                                                                   Orion: Not quite yet, Miss Carter... You'll have to try much harder.                                Penelope: *Giggles* Okay, okay... Hmm, I wonder what else I could do...? How about...               Orion: Much better... My god, this was worth the wait... I’ve been wanting to see you like this ever since I saw that first pic on Instagram...                                                         Penelope continues stripping for you. She leans softly against the bedpost, and curves her rear into an inviting pose.                                                                                  Penelope: Okay... I don't have a single piece of clothing left on me. This should more than         compensate you for all the teasing. I hope you enjoyed the spectacle.                               Orion: Penny... you're a fucking goddess. Your face, your ass, those gumdrop nipples... you’re      making a man drool...                                                                               Penelope: Yeah, I can tell that you're liking the show. Your cock has been growing redder and redder throughout this little exhibition... not to mention bigger.                                        Orion: I’m not the only one enjoying this. You like showing off for me, don’t you? You like when I  gaze at your bare tits... Admit it. You like being my personal little model, Penny.                 Penelope: I could say the same thing about you. Orion Junior seems to be really enjoying himself.   *Giggles* You should see your face. I'd love to know what's running through your mind right now.    Orion: Well, since you asked... I was thinking about how those huge, heavy tits of yours would feel in my hands.                                                                                        Penelope: Oh, really...? Well... In the interest of science... do you wanna feel for yourself?      Orion: Wait... are you serious?                                                                     Penelope: Mm-hm... Yeah, why not? You’ve caught me in a pretty good mood. Treat yourself...         You move closer to Penelope, frantically trying to memorize every square inch of the model’s        ethereal body.                                                                                      Orion: God...                                                                                       Your hands enclose both of her breasts, indulging in their warmth and tenderness. Penny releases a  little squeak of surprise.                                                                          Penelope: Aaah...                                                                                   Orion: Dear Lord, they feel so incredibly soft... They're firm enough not to sag... yet, they’re so supple. And I can barely fit them in my hands... *Grabbing her by the waist* Can I try one last     thing before we end this, Penny?                                                                    Penelope: W-What? What are you gonna do?                                                            Orion: Something I've been dreaming about since I first spotted you and your “assets” in Kredon.    You wrap your mouth around Penelope’s erect nipple, and begin licking the “best tits on Instagram.” Penelope: W-What are you doing...? Oh fuck... *Giggles* You're crazy, Orion... Although... I've     gotta say that I kinda love your cockiness.                                                         You wrap your arms around Penelope's waist, holding her in place with a firm grip before beginning  to suck on the blonde's voluptuous breasts.                                                         Penelope: Damn, Orion... Mmmm... F-Fuck, keep sucking... I d-didn't know I was so sensitive there...Orion: (Jesus Christ... Her skin, her scent, the heat she radiates... This feels like a goddamn     dream come true.)                                                                                   Penelope: MMmmmmmm...                                                                               Unable to resist, you suck on Penelope's breast as hard as you can, alternating between little      nipple flicks and small bites, determined to leave some sort of mark.                               Penelope: Aaahh... y-yeah... you're doing such a good job...                                        Orion: (There are thousands of men in Penelope’s DMs who would pay exorbitant amounts of money just to see her naked. Yet here I am, seeing them up close and personal. No... not only that... I'm      feeling her... I'm tasting her... She's mine... For at least tonight, Penelope Carter is all        mine...)                                                                                            Penelope: Aaaah!                                                                                    Orion: (I feel like I could do this all night. I just want to devour her...)                        Penelope: *Shoving your face away* Okay, okay, that's enough!                                       Orion: Aw, really? I was just starting to enjoy myself!                                             Penelope: *Giggles* You've been enjoying it since the beginning. Besides, Orion Junior was          constantly poking me down here, in case you didn't notice.                                          Orion: Not my fault. Your tits are literally making me lose my mind, Penny.                         Penelope: You really like my tits, huh?                                                             Orion: “Like” is an understatement. I want to worship them on an altar.                             Penelope: *Giggles* You're a filthy little degenerate.                                              Orion: Can't deny it. What can I say, your tits bring it out of me.                                 Penelope: Hmm... You know what... Since you seem to like them so much... *Shoving you down to the   couch* How about I give you a little memory that’ll truly be unforgettable...                       Orion: Oh god...                                                                                    Penelope: *Giggles* Jesus, Orion, how long can you keep up an erection like that?                   Orion: With your naked body in front of me? Probably hours. I mean... holy fuck, Penny. Your body is almost indescribably perfect. It’s like someone pushed all your body’s features to their max       settings.                                                                                           Penelope: Well, I'm not the only one with their “features” pushed at the max here...                Penelope kneels between your legs and ties up her hair.                                             Penelope: Well...                                                                                   Orion: O-Ooh god...                                                                                 Penelope: We're gonna have to do something about this, don't you think? We can't go back to the     party with you in this state. What if it slips out of your costume again? We can’t have Nova or     another girl accidentally catching sight of this monster dick, can we?                              Orion: Definitely... there have already been too many wardrobe malfunctions tonight... Did you have a plan in mind?                                                                                     Penny grabs both of her boobs and quickly buries your cock between them.                            Orion: OH GOD... Oh my fucking GOD. They're so damn warm...                                         Penelope: *Giggles* I can imagine. Do you like feeling my big titties wrapped around your cock like this?                                                                                               Orion: Fuck me, keep going... I love it when you stare into my eyes, Penny... Keep looking at me    with that face... It’s like you’re drenched in lust...                                              Penelope: *Giggles* I confess that doing this in Regina's dorm is kind of... arousing. We could get caught at any... single... moment.                                                                  Orion: AAAahh yeah... My god, Penny, please don't stop...                                           Your dick begins to lubricate itself with precum, and, as if motivated by the liquid, Penny         increases her pace with a quiet determination. Her eyes flit back and forth between your face and   the meat buried in her chest.                                                                       Orion: O-O-Ohhh fuck yes, that's it... T-This is amazing... The “Best tits on Instagram”, eh...? How many DMs have you gotten about this exact situation?                                               Penelope: *Giggles* I've lost count. They offer me money, gifts, and even trips sometimes!          Orion: Aaaahh... this feels so good...                                                              Penelope: I rejected all their requests, but here I am doing it for free, for some high school kid  with a fat dick. Not a very good business move, I guess...                                          Orion: *Chuckles* Y-You won't catch me complaining... But I’m not just some high school kid,        y’know...                                                                                           You stand up and seize Penelope's breasts with your hands, your dick still trapped between them.    Orion: I think it’s time for me to take the lead, Penny... You're okay with it, right?              Penelope: Yeah, I guess you can take a shot...                                                      Orion: Aaaahh... yeah! YEAH! That's it, Penny... Keep staring into my eyes like that... (My fucking god, Penny's cleavage feels like fucking a pussy... I'm FUCKING the best tits on Instagram!)        AAaaahh...                                                                                          You thrust into Penelope’s cleavage frantically, your balls slapping against her tummy with each    stroke.                                                                                             Orion: This sensation is amazing... AAaahhh... A-Am I squeezing them too hard?                      Penelope: I like it that way... *Giggles* It feels good when you’re a little rough with them...     Being used for your pleasure like this is... pretty fucking hot, not gonna lie.                     Orion: Oooh god... you’re a naughty girl, aren’t you... You're gonna make me cum way too quickly... You abruptly grab Penelope and lift her to her feet.                                                Penelope: W-Why did you stop?                                                                       Orion: I don't wanna finish yet...                                                                  Penelope: You don't?                                                                                Orion: Not yet, babe...                                                                             Penelope: F-fuck... y-you're... Y-You're touching my pussy with your dick...                        Orion: Your lips are literally dripping over my cock, Penelope... I don’t think it would be fair if I was the only one to cum tonight... Besides, you’ve been so generous tonight... And you’re so...   tempting...                                                                                         Penelope: Don’t even think about it, Orion. W-We're not gonna f-fuck. I’m not a first date kinda    girl, y’know... Besides, we don't even have a condom...                                             Orion: Oh... so a condom is what’s stopping us? If I had one, we would be fucking right now?        Penelope: *Giggles* I didn't say that. We’ve already done so much tonight. You’re not satisfied yet?You turn Penelope around and slide your penis between her thick thighs again.                       Penelope: Aahh... AAaaaah... What are you d-doing to me?                                            You carefully begin to slide your dick between Penelope's legs, each thrust slightly spreading apart her pussy lips.                                                                                    Orion: Oh god, Penny...                                                                             Penelope: Fuck, Orion...                                                                            Orion: You're actually dripping... Did you get that turned on from having my cock between your tits?Penelope: AAaahhh...                                                                                Orion: (I know she'd get mad just for trying, but... I’m literally going insane trying to not bury  my cock balls-deep inside of her.)                                                                  Penelope: *Slight moan* AAaahh...                                                                   Orion: Do you like this? Gliding your pussy along my cock?                                          Penelope: I-I do... I like it a lot... Move faster... please move faster...                         Orion: You want it faster? Tell me, Penny...                                                        Penelope: Y-Yesss!                                                                                  Romantic approach                                                                                   You hasten your pace, slamming your hips against Penelope's generous buttocks while exhaling small  breaths on her neck.                                                                                Penelope: AAAAhhh...                                                                                Rough approach                                                                                      Your hands wrap around Penelope’s soft neck as you hasten your pace, your hips slamming relentlessly against the blonde's buttocks.                                                                     Penelope: Mmmghhh... y-yess...                                                                      Orion: Ohhh Penny... This feels so fucking good...                                                  Penelope: AAaaahh... I-It d-does... s-so fucking good... K-Keep up that pace, Orion...              Penelope squeezes her legs together, and more juices drip down her thighs. Your dick begins to slide even more smoothly against her lips.                                                               Orion: Oh g-god, yes...                                                                             Penelope: MmmMmmm...                                                                                Orion: I know you were craving for this... I know you fingered yourself thinking about me... You    love this, don't you? My hands wrapped around your neck, thrusting into you from behind... I know   you want to be fucked roughly... I know you like ropes... You want everyone to treat you like a     princess, but deep down you’re a kinky little girl, aren’t you, Penny...? Don't think I forgot what you said that day in Warthogs, miss... Or are you gonna tell me that was all a lie?                 Penelope: *Choking* A-A-AAhhh... *Giggles* I-It w-wasn't a lieeee... I-I want to be fucked so hard  that my pussy is sore the n-next day...                                                             Orion: Ohh... f-fuck me, Penny... You like me using your body as a toy, don't you?                  Penelope: *Choking* Y-Yeagh... u-use me as your fucking toy, Orion...                               Orion: I wanna make your body writhe in pleasure, Penny...                                          Penelope: *Giggles* A-A-AAhhh... I-It was just because you were the only guy in the house...        *Moaning* AAaaahh... Y-You’re telling me you haven’t jacked off to me since arriving in Kredon? The walls aren’t that thick y’know, it’s amazing what you can hear in the hallway during a midnight     b-bathroom trip...                                                                                  Orion: Aaah... You’re right, I haven't been able to stop dreaming of spending a night with you in   weeks...                                                                                            Penelope: Aaaahh...                                                                                 Orion: My only wish is seeing your divine body writhe in pleasure...                                Penelope: AAAaaHhhh...                                                                              Orion: After I pump it... all... night... long...                                                   Penelope: AAAAAAAAAAAGHH... *Choking* F-Fuck... I'm gonna cum, Orion... F-Fuck, Orion... I'm gonna  cum...                                                                                              Orion: M-Me too... God, Penny... F-Fuck, I'm about to...                                            Penelope: Y-YEAH! Cum for me, baby...                                                               Orion: F-Fuck, I can't stop it...                                                                   Penelope: AAAAH...                                                                                  Orion: AAAAAAAGGHHH!                                                                                Penelope: Aaah!                                                                                     Orion: AAAAAARRGGHHH... Goddamn... (I needed this so badly... my blue balls were about to fucking   explode...) *Sitting down on the floor* Holy shit... You're something else, Penny...                Penelope: Me? You're fucking crazy... How’d you convince me to get you off in my archenemy’s room?  Orion: *Chuckles* Hah! Like you're one to talk!                                                     Penelope: I'm gonna have to ask you to come to all the parties I'm invited to from now on, Orion.   Tonight's was... definitely the craziest one I've ever had.                                         Orion: Agree with you there, that's for sure... But hey, going crazy sometimes is worthwhile, don't you think? Imagine if we’d never decided to sneak in here tonight...                                Penelope: Oh, for sure. What's life without going a little crazy from time to time?                 Orion: I like the way you think, miss.                                                              Penelope: So... what should we do about that? You sure emptied yourself. It was like a fire hose!   Orion: Oh, the jizz? Um... should I clean it? Guess I can look around for some sprays...            Penelope: Uh... Nah, fuck it. It's my payback for the yearbook.                                     Orion: *Laughs* I wish I could see Regina's disgusted face when she sees that puddle.               Penelope: I guess I'll settle for seeing it in class.                                               Orion: *Chuckles* Make sure to tell me about it after!                                              Penelope: Will do. But anyway... we should get dressed and get the fuck out of here before someone  finds us.                                                                                           Orion: Just let me say goodbye to my beloved twins before you cover them. I'll miss you, girls. I’ll always cherish the time we’ve spent together.                                                      Penelope: *Snorts* You're such a dork. You’re lucky I think you’re cute.                            Orion: I should ask at the counter before going anywhere. (On second thought... I think I've had    enough. This damned music is getting to me. This isn’t really my scene... I'm sure they'll survive  without me. I'm getting the fuck outta here.) *Typing on your phone* (I'll just text them that I'm  leaving. This isn’t my scene... I'm sure Penelope will have a great time with or without me. I'm    getting the fuck outta here.) *Typing on your phone* (I'll just text her to tell her I'm leaving.)  *Yawns* (I need a good night of sleep...)                                                           Penelope: And you say Nova is supposed to be around here?                                           Orion: I think so. She wasn't feeling well, so she went with Akira to get the reward for that game I told you about. I went to the cafeteria but–                                                       Nova: Finally!!                                                                                     Orion: Huh? Nova! We were looking for you! How are you feeling?                                     Nova: Much better, thanks! I think I spent like an hour in the bathroom trying to vomit, but nothing came out, so... I'm s-still a bit d-drunk.                                                         Orion: *Chuckles* I can tell. Is that box what I think it is?                                       Nova: *Giggles* YES! I was afraid it was a prank, but luckily it wasn't! An Intel Xeon Dragon X!    Penelope: Wow, congrats, guys!                                                                      Nova: *Giggles* Thanks.                                                                             Penelope: I want more details about the game though! Sounds like I missed out!                      Nova: Oh w-well, there's not much to tell, to be honest! Just... s-some beer-pong and card games.   T-The typical party. R-right, Orion?                                                                Orion: R-right!                                                                                     Nova: What about you, though? How were things over on your side?                                    Penelope: Oh, well, you know... pretty much the same. Just some drinking games and Jagerbombs.      The... typical party. Right, Orion?                                                                 Orion: Y-Yep!                                                                                       Nova: I see... Damn, sounds like you guys had a fun time too!                                       Penelope: Well, I don't know about you guys, but I think it’s time to call it a night.              Nova: Y-Yeah, I'm going with you! It's already 4:45 AM.                                             Orion: Damn, really? I didn't know it was that late.                                                Penelope: What are your plans, Orion? Are you staying over here or are you coming with us?          Orion: Hmm, it kinda sucks that the three of us never hung out together. What about having one last drink before leaving?                                                                               Nova: Uhh... I d-don't know if I could take one more drink... my one beer has made me hazy enough as is...                                                                                              Orion: Don't worry! I'll walk you two home! Do you really think I'd miss the opportunity to escort  two pretty ladies back to their doorsteps? Please, I'm a gentleman.                                 Penelope: *Chuckles* Alright, mister... In that case, let's have one last toast!                    Orion: Sweet! Last I heard she was in the cafeteria, but she's not there now, so I don't–           Nova: Finally!!                                                                                     Orion: Huh? Nova! We were looking for you!                                                          Nova: Shut up! Y-You abandoned me!                                                                  Orion: What?! No, I didn't!                                                                         Nova: YES YOU DID! Y-You didn't come back, so Akira gave the p-prize to Dolores. I lost. B-Because  of you.                                                                                             Orion: Are you drunk?                                                                               Nova: W-Well yeah! W-What was I supposed to do while you were I-don't-even-know-where? I drank... a beer.                                                                                               Orion: Just one?                                                                                    Nova: I-I don't handle alcohol very well.                                                           Penelope: I'm sorry, Nova, I'm the one who distracted Orion. You can blame me for this.             Nova: D-don't worry, Penny. You didn't know about the game. Orion, on the other hand...             Orion: Come on, Nova, don't get mad at me! I'll make it up to you, I promise. It's 4:45 AM, so we   should probably start heading out. I'll walk you home and... I'll buy you a huge kebab on the way   there! There's nothing better to sober you up.                                                      Nova: Uh, t-that actually sounds pretty good. Okay, let's go! I want a mixed one!                   Orion: Deal! *Chuckles* (It's always cute to see how easy is to make her happy.)                    You walk Nova to her house and come back home with Penelope.                                        Penelope: Aaah... finally! Aah... finally! *Taking her shoes off* Those shoes were killing me! Home sweet home...                                                                                       Orion: Man, I'm so fucking tired. I'm getting too old for these sorts of things.                    Penelope: *Laughs* Yeah, definitely. After 17, everything starts going downhill. Everyone knows it. Orion: *Laughs* Absolutely. Are you feeling drunk?                                                  Penelope: Nah, I usually have trouble getting seriously drunk. I'm just tired.                      Orion: Makes sense. It was a pretty intense night...                                                Penelope: Yeah, I guess it was... Although... not due to dancing.                                   Orion: Now that you mention it, I still owe you a dance.                                            Penelope: Do you?                                                                                   Orion: Yeah! I haven't forgotten what we saw with the Reminisc... *Hiccup* Hic! ...the              Reminiscecombobulator at Warthogs. You kind of missed your school dance because of me. Didn't you   tell me you didn't get to go to Kredon's Spring Dance when you were little? I owe you a little slow dance.                                                                                              Penelope: Oh my, so romantic. Are you a good dancer?                                                Orion: Good? My moves are irresistible.                                                             Penelope: *Laughs* Can't wait. Well, I don't know about you, but I'm gonna put my pajamas on and    sleep until noon.                                                                                   Orion: Oh, that sounds like a great plan.                                                           Penelope: Yeah, I guess it was. At least you knocked some sense into me with the Regina thing.      Thanks, Orion. You're a good friend.                                                                Orion: Hey, that's what friends are for.                                                            Penelope: Yeah... I guess so. (God, I'm so stupid.) Um... anyway, I'm gonna put my pajamas on and   sleep until noon. I had a lot of fun tonight, Orion. Thank you.                                     Orion: No goodnight kiss?                                                                           Penelope: *Giggles* Goodnight kiss? Hmmm... where could I give you a kiss?                          Orion: On the forehead, maybe. But if you're feeling bold tonight, the cheek might work too. No     wrong answers.                                                                                      Penelope: *Snorts* Hmm.                                                                             Penelope takes off your circlet and presses her soft lips against your mouth. Without hesitation,   her mouth opens slightly, allowing your tongue to slip inside. After what feels like a matter of    hours, or perhaps just several seconds, she breaks away from you and the kiss ends.                 Penelope: . . . Good night, Orion...                                                                Orion: Good night, Penny. (Wow... What a way to end the night! That’s what I call a party.) *Yawns* (Time to sleep, though... If I don't have sweet dreams even after a night like this... I'm a lost   cause.)                                                                                             Penelope: I'm glad to have you as a friend.                                                         Orion: Likewise, Penny. Goodnight! (God, 6:45 AM... It's almost dawn. I hope I can manage to sleep  at least a few hours tonight. There’s supposed to be a thunderstorm and they always seem to wake me up.) *Jumping into bed* (Hmmm... this bed has never felt fluffier... Finally some rest... God, 6:45 AM... It's almost dawn. I hope I can manage to sleep at least a few hours tonight. There’s supposed to be a thunderstorm and they always seem to wake me up.) *Jumping into bed* (Hmmm... this bed never felt fluffier... Finally some rest...) Hmmm... (What a shitty night.) *Looking at your phone* Holy fuck, 6:45 AM! (It's almost dawn and I haven't slept a minute...) *Sighs* (I haven't been able to   stop thinking about what happened with Penny at the party. It's almost dawn and I haven't slept a   minute... damn insomnia.) *Jumping into bed* (Hmmm... let's see if I manage to sleep for a couple or three hours at least...) . . . Zzzzz...                                                            Nancy: GOOD MORNING, SWEETIE!                                                                       Orion: *Jumping up* W-Wait, what?!                                                                  Nancy: We're going to my office, remember?                                                          Orion: What?! Now?! It's not even 7 AM! W-We just arrived from the party!                           Nancy: Yeah, I saw Penny coming out of the bathroom! She looked so happy... super tired though! I   hope you had fun!                                                                                   Orion: Um...                                                                                        Nancy: I'm sorry, but we have to leave soon. Getting there this early is critical! You'll understand why after I explain the plan to you.                                                               Orion: Y-Yeah, don't worry. It's just that... I wasn't expecting it to be SO early.                 Nancy: I mean... I can try to handle it on my own, if you want to sleep in.                         Orion: Huh? And miss all the fun? “Thanatos collects the 10 Gems of Doom and becomes the new CEO of Ulysses.” “Orion Richards, the other closest competitor, fell behind because he needed to take a    nap.” Nah, they won't say that about me.                                                            Nancy: That's the Orion I know!                                                                     Orion: I'll handle it. Nothing a good shower and a HUGE cup of coffee can't fix.                    Nancy: Nice! Go take that shower and meet me downstairs!                                            Orion: Alright!                                                                                     Nancy: Thanks for sacrificing your sleep for the mission, Orion.                                    Orion: I'm the one who pushed you all into the whole “Gems of Doom mission” in the first place. No  need to thank me for anything.                                                                      Nancy: Still, thank you. I'll make it up to you, I promise...                                       Orion: That promise is just as invigorating as all the coffee in the world...                       Nancy: Still, thank you.                                                                            Orion: Let's go! (Hmm... So this is Nancy's office, eh? Pretty cool...) *Yawns* (Pretty huge place. God, I'm so sleepy. If Nancy doesn't come back with that coffee soon, I might fall asleep leaning   against one of these walls. Hmm... Maybe I should close my eyes and just let them rest for a minute. Yeah, that's smart... Just for a minute... Just resting my eyes... Just a min...) Zzzzz...         Nancy: Orion!                                                                                       Orion: W-What?! Y-YES! X equals 47, Mr. Keating! I'm awake! I-I am... Huh? Oh, hi there! Please tell me you have my drug.                                                                               Nancy: With extra caffeine!                                                                         Orion: Oh, thank god!                                                                               Nancy: I was also able to fit two more in this bag.                                                 Thank her for the coffee                                                                            Orion: *Drinking the first coffee* You’re a lifesaver! After all these years, you’re still taking   care of me like a babysitter, eh Nancy?                                                             Nancy: Aww, you're too sweet, Orion! Of course I’ve gotta take care of you. And I need you to be so charged up for the mission!                                                                         Orion: A mission I still know nothing about, by the way.                                            Focus on the mission                                                                                Orion: *Drinking the first coffee* Good. I have to be so charged up for the... mission. A mission I still know nothing about, by the way.                                                               Nancy: I know, I'll catch you up in a minute. But let's go to my desk first, on the second floor.   Orion: *Gulping down your second coffee* Won't people ask what I’m doing here?                      Nancy: Don't worry, it's Sunday, so the office will be empty. There's only a couple of security     guards by the entrance, but we used the emergency exit, so they shouldn’t know about us.            Orion: *Chugging your third coffee* Ah, smart. And I've got good news, energy is returning to my    veins already!                                                                                      Nancy: *Chuckles* Glad to hear that! We shouldn't take unnecessary risks, though. Let's try to be as fast as possible.                                                                                  Orion: You're the boss!                                                                             You both get inside the elevator. Nancy hits the 2nd floor button.                                  Orion: Holy shit, that's a lot of buttons. How tall is this building?                               Nancy: There's only 4 floors above ground level, but there are 13 of them below-ground.             Orion: Damn, thirteen?! Really?                                                                     Nancy: Yeah. 5 of them are parking levels, and the rest are warehouses and labs that require special temperature conditions.                                                                            Orion: Oh true, sometimes I forget you work in the sciences.                                        Nancy: Well... to be fair, since Ulysses subcontracted us, everything I've been doing is paperwork. I miss my labcoat days, but they brought their own researchers, and now we're not even allowed on   some of the floors.                                                                                 Orion: It was to be expected, they're a very secretive company. NDAs and all that.                  Nancy: There are usually people around here, but the office floors are typically empty on Sundays.  We're gonna be tota–                                                                                Gertrude: *Mumbling* Ugh, I can't believe I'm the one who has to do this! After so many years at the company! Don't they know who I am? Huh? Nan? What are you doing here, girl? What a coincidence!    Nancy: G-Gertrude?! What are YOU doing here? It's Sunday!                                           Gertrude: Well, you know, duty calls. My Richie is on a business trip and my son is playing that    Ethernium thing, so I thought I’d catch up on work. Between us, I think Mr. Dunder is going to      promote me next month. I've seen how he looks at me...                                              Nancy: Uh... o-okay, yeah. Good luck, Gerty.                                                        Gertrude: What about you, Nan? I see you brought your daughter with you! Good to see you again,     Dalia.                                                                                              Orion: (God, does this woman never listen?) Um...                                                   Roleplay as Nancy's child                                                                           Orion: Thank you, Gertrude. Good to see you again. I've been looking forward to seeing where my...  mom works, so she invited me to come with her today.                                                Gertrude: Ah, that was an excellent idea, Nan, excellent! Dalia will learn a lot seeing two         empowered women like us at their workplace.                                                         Nancy: Yeah... that was exactly my idea. I thought of coming on a Sunday because this place is      usually too hectic during the week.                                                                 Gertrude: Very smart. Watch me and your mom closely, Dalia, you'll learn great life lessons and     skills.                                                                                             Orion: Yeah, I won't take my eyes off her...                                                        Gertrude: By the way, I just want you to know that I support your decision SO much, Dalia. As the   president of Kredon's PTA, I always try to advocate for the rights of the trans community. Some of  us even started a campaign on TikTok in favor of the LGBTTQQIAAP movement! How are your dancing     skills, Dalia? Would you like to join us?                                                           Orion: T-That sounds delightful, but dancing isn't really my thing. Thanks for the offer, though.   Gertrude: That's too bad... but let us know if you change your mind!                                Orion: S-Sure, will do.                                                                             Gertrude: Anyway, it's good to see you, Nan, but I should get going now. I'm terribly busy, as you  know.                                                                                               Nancy: Of course!                                                                                   Correct her                                                                                         Orion: *Sighs* Please, pay careful attention to my lips as I say this to you. I. AM. NOT. DALIA. I'm not a girl, and I'm not Nancy's child. My name is Orion. I'm a guy! A male!                        Gertrude: Of course! You can identify as whatever you want. Why, recently, my husb–                 Orion: I identify as a guy because I've always been one, for fuck's sake! I was born a male!        Gertrude: Hmm...? Wait, wait, wait. He was born a... male?                                          Nancy: Uh... yes, I think so.                                                                       Gertrude: Agh! You can't be serious! I can’t believe you’ve been lying to me all this time, Dalia!  That is SO transphobic of you...                                                                    Orion: ME?! How the hell is my being a man transphobic?!                                            Gertrude: Wow, the fact that you even have to ask that... I can't even look you in the eyes anymore.Orion: I didn't even lie about anything, you just don't listen to me!                               Gertrude: Hah! Of course, because a woman always has to listen to men, and do exactly what they say, right?                                                                                             Orion: What are you talking about?!                                                                 Gertrude: God, you’re such a misogynist. What values have you taught to this boy, Nancy?            Nancy: Uh...                                                                                        Gertrude: When will society learn, Nan? WHEN?! It's like we're still living in the 19th century!    Nancy: Erm... Yeah... you're t-totally right. This is absolutely... unacceptable. Actually, I       brought him here to teach him how to be more tolerant. He’s been watching all these videos on       YouTube and sketchy forums... Seeing empowered women like us as leaders at their workplace might do him some good.                                                                                      Gertrude: Ahh, that's actually a brilliant idea, Nan.                                               Orion: *Snorts* (Nice recovery.)                                                                    Gertrude: And who's this? New hire?                                                                 Orion: Um... yes, I'm Orion, nice to meet you. I'm the new... intern.                               Gertrude: Ah, I'm Gertrude. Nancy probably told you about me already.                               Orion: Y-Yeah, totally. You look even better than what she said.                                    Gertrude: Oh my, we’ve got such a charming young boy at the office...                               Nancy: Anyway, I've gotta go with him to... show him how to photocopy some documents.               Gertrude: Of course, of course. I should get going too. I'm terribly busy, as you know.             Nancy: We're gonna be in my office, doing some spreadsheeting.                                      Gertrude: *Hearty laugh* Yes, that sounds like a good plan. I feel like you've been falling a little behind lately. I know you can do better.                                                           Nancy: Yeah... and, oh, now that I remember... if you see that Ulysses representative arriving,     could you let me know?                                                                              Gertrude: Sure thing, no problem.                                                                   Nancy: Thanks! Let's go... erm... Dalia. Let's go, Orion.                                           You and Nancy walk across the floor until she opens a door to a spacious and modern-looking room.   Orion: *Whistles* Not bad!                                                                          Nancy: *Closing the door behind her* Dammit, that was too close! I didn't want anyone to see you    here.                                                                                               Orion: We'll be fine. Gertrude doesn't seem to be that sharp anyway.                                Nancy: *Chuckles* Fair enough.                                                                      Orion: Alright, Mommy... Alright, Nan... We're finally here. What's this plan of yours? Enlighten   me.                                                                                                 Nancy: Okay... Remember what I asked Nova last Friday at The Roof? If she could program some malware capable of stealing the Eternum inventory of someone?                                              Orion: Mm-hm. I do.                                                                                 Nancy: Well... we did it!                                                                           Orion: No way! Already?! She didn't tell me anything!                                               Nancy: I asked her to keep it a secret. I wanted to give you the surprise.                          Orion: Holy shit, that's amazing! I don’t know what was more impressive: Nova’s hacking skills to   put that together, or the fact that she was able to hide it from me that long!                      Nancy: *Chuckles* It has to be physically linked to the E-visor of the target, and then it has to be recovered. It's risky, but the reward is well worth the effort. The “victim” wouldn't even notice  something missing until it was too late.                                                            Orion: Wow, that definitely sounds like a powerful tool. Too bad we don't know the real identity of Thanatos. That could be our secret weapon!                                                          Nancy: *Sitting on the table* Actually... I'm happy you said that. Because it brings us to the next part of the plan.                                                                                   Orion: Huh?                                                                                         Nancy: The Founder told you that Ulysses knows the first person to find each Gem, correct?          Orion: Yep. They can’t track subsequent owners, but they can track the first one.                   Nancy: And it is public knowledge that Thanatos found the first Gem of Doom, during one of Ulysses' special events.                                                                                     Orion: Also correct. And then he took the rest of them from other players.                          Nancy: Well... it turns out that every Sunday, a representative from Ulysses comes here to collect  all the data we obtained during the week. I've done some digging, and I know who he is: Clarence    Ruiz, a Ulysses senior executive and a big name in the Data and Analytics division. He has a laptop where he keeps all his reports, and I get the feeling that the information we need is in there. And you, dear Orion... are going to retrieve that information.                                          Orion: DAMN! You want to steal Ulysses' private info right from their database?!                    Nancy: Pretty much.                                                                                 Orion: So... if I understood all this correctly... we might be able to discover Thanatos' real      identity?                                                                                           Nancy: Or his ID number. At the very least, some sort of clue that can lead us towards him.         Orion: Amazing! But how are we gonna get access to that laptop?                                     Nancy: *Giggles* Pay close attention.                                                               Orion: *Chuckles* I feel like I'm in a movie.                                                       Nancy: This represents this office. I'm the glazed donut and you're the onion.                      Orion: Fair choices.                                                                                Nancy: The tangerine is Clarence, and this... broccoli can be Gertrude. We'll take advantage of her being here.                                                                                         Orion: Mm-hm.                                                                                       Nancy: There are two elevators, represented by the pencil case and the pineapple.                   Orion: Gotcha.                                                                                      Nancy: Gertrude will come to tell us that Clarence arrived. He'll use the pineapple elevator because that's the one closest to his parking space. We won't be able to see him go to his office. Then    I'll follow after Gertrude with some excuse, and I'll call Clarence's office pretending to be the   front desk. I'll tell him that he's required there immediately, for some emergency. If he buys it,  he'll go to the pencil case elevator, so you should see him walk past this room! You’ll then have   about 7 or 8 minutes to sneak into his office, before he returns. Try finding all the info you can  from his laptop, and then take the pineapple elevator so you can avoid him.                         Orion: Simple and to the point. I like it. What if he turns off the laptop? I guess it'll be        password protected.                                                                                 Nancy: He shouldn't. I came last Sunday too, and I saw him leave the laptop open while he grabbed   some coffee. The key is to make him believe there’s no one else on this floor, so make sure he      doesn't see you when he walks past this room.                                                       Orion: Understood.                                                                                  Nancy: Any questions?                                                                               Orion: All clear! I guess all we have to do now is wait for Gertrude to come and tell us that       Clarence is here.                                                                                   Nancy: That's right. Anything you want to discuss in the meantime? Do you have better control of    your powers in Eternum?                                                                             Orion: I do! Although, I haven't been able to play much this weekend. I needed some rest. What about you, though? I heard the ERE bent the knee!                                                        Nancy: Ah, I see word travels fast!                                                                 Orion: How did you do that?!                                                                        Nancy: Erm... well...                                                                               Maximo: Ladies and gentlemen... The leaders of the proud factions of Macedonia and the Eastern Roman Empire are here to make an announcement!                                                           Crowd: *Cheers*                                                                                     Leader of the Macedonians: My queen, I'll admit that it is an absolute honor to join the WRE under  your command. All of my armies are at your disposal.                                                Nancy: That is very generous of you, Marcellus. All your people will be treated with dignity and    respect, and you have access to the resources of the WRE.                                           Leader of the Macedonians: You're too kind, my queen. Thank you. Macedonia will join the Western    Roman Empire! LONG LIVE THE EMPRESS!                                                                Crowd: *Cheers*                                                                                     Leader of the ERE: *Spitting on the ground* Pathetic. I expected more from you, Marcellus. You're   lame.                                                                                               Nancy: Welcome to Rome, Cicero. It is a pleasure to finally meet the proud leader of the ERE. I have heard great things about you.                                                                      Leader of the ERE: Shut up, whore. I will not be fooled by your false humility, like all these other clowns. The ERE will never bend the knee!                                                          Nancy: You've been defeated, Cicero. Your men are captured and your lands are devastated. Offer an  honorable surrender and save your people. Some of them make a living here. The bloodbath is         unnecessary.                                                                                        Leader of the ERE: And then what? We're the last faction of this server that you haven't conquered. If we join you, what do you think will happen? Treason. Riots. A bloated empire cannot equally serve its people. Peace will not last.                                                                   Nancy: Then I'll expand the Empire to other servers. The WRE knows no borders.                      Leader of the ERE: *Mocking laugh* Other servers? You're out of your fucking mind. This is a        roleplaying server, and nothing more! Do you really intend to send your men to other worlds and form an inter-server faction?                                                                           Nancy: That is exactly what I intend to do. Your lack of ambition is frustrating, Cicero. Join the  WRE and your people will be–                                                                        Leader of the ERE: The ERE will never join you!! NEVER! Agh, this is why women can't be the leaders of anything... you just ruin EVERYTHING!                                                            Nancy: *Sighs* In that case, I have no other choice but...                                          Leader of the ERE: Kill me if you want! I will gladly accept my death! And my men will follow me!   Nancy: Very well. Maximo, take Cicero and–                                                          Leader of the ERE: They'd rather die than accept the orders of a fucking whore!                     Nancy: *Sighs* Take Cicero and–                                                                     Leader of the ERE: We will never surrender!                                                         Nancy: And crucify him.                                                                             Leader of the ERE: W-What?                                                                          Maximo: Yes, my Queen.                                                                              Leader of the ERE: *Nervous chuckle* You're kidding, right?                                         Nancy: Grab three iron spikes and nail him to a cross at the entrance of the city. But station him  with an Exit Portal in his line of view. The enticement of escape will only further cause him to be consumed by despair.                                                                                Maximo: It will be done, my Queen.                                                                  Leader of the ERE: W-What?!                                                                         Nancy: How much do you think you'll endure, Cicero? The nails slowly tearing your flesh. The        insolation of the sun burning your skin. And the ravens feasting upon your guts... Peck, peck,      peck!                                                                                               Leader of the ERE: W-WHAT THE FUCK?! This is literally torture! That's against Eternum's General    Code of Ethics!                                                                                     Nancy: I don’t seem to see any Praetorians around... do you?                                        Leader of the ERE: You're fucking nuts! W-We're just roleplaying! T-This is just a game!            Nancy: Is it? Do you really want to put me to the test, Cicero?                                     Leader of the ERE: *Hyperventilating* I-I... *Hyperventilating* . . . E-Erm... Our men will aid the expansion of the WRE. T-The ERE will join the Western Roman Empire.                                 Crowd: *Cheers*                                                                                     Nancy: And?                                                                                         Leader of the ERE: . . . A-And... Long live the Empress!                                            Nancy: Excellent! You can reach out to Maximo if you need any help from now – I have to log off to  make dinner for my family. Tonight’s lasagna night! Welcome to the WRE, Cicero. You made the right  decision.                                                                                           Leader of the ERE: *Grunting* Hmm...                                                                Nancy: Um... Well, you know, it's all about diplomacy and dialogue. I don't want to bore you with   it. But anyway, we've still got some time to kill before the Ulysses rep shows up...                Orion: Yep... Any idea about what we could do while we wait?                                        Nancy: Oh well, some entertaining pastimes come to mind, but they would take too long, I'm afraid.  And we need to be prepared. No distractions.                                                        Orion: Oh, really? And what are those “pastimes”...?                                                Nancy: Don't tempt me.                                                                              Orion: Tempting is my pastime.                                                                      Nancy takes a quick step towards you, until you’re face to face. You can feel her body breathing    heavily against you.                                                                                Orion: (Holy shit... When I’m up close like this, it’s really clear where Penny got her boobs       from... My god, her boobs look even bigger when I’m up close.) *Groping her butt* (And that ass...) So... what did you have in mind...?                                                                 Nancy: Well... the last time we were alone we were annoyingly interrupted, remember...?             Orion: Yes, I remember it too well...                                                               Nancy: *Whispering* I'm so fucking horny, Orion. I haven't even been able to sleep properly the last few nights.                                                                                        Orion: Is there something I can do...?                                                              Nancy: I was thinking that... Maybe... We could...                                                  Gertrude: Nan, that grumpy man from Ulysses is here.                                                Nancy: Huh? Oh, already?                                                                            Orion: *Chuckles* Yeah, I know you can be quite persuasive.                                         Gertrude: Nan, that grumpy man from Ulysses is here.                                                Nancy: Oh, already?                                                                                 Gertrude: Yeah, do you want me to let him know you're looking for him?                              Nancy: No, no! Don't worry about that... How about instead, you and I get some donuts? My treat! You deserve it for being such a good friend, Gerty.                                                    Gertrude: Hah! Trying to make me fat so you look better standing next to me?                        Nancy: Guilty!                                                                                      Gertrude: *Hearty laugh* Okay, okay, I'll accept them! But only if they’re low-fat! Can’t have these sugary foods messing with my flawless skin...                                                      Nancy: Sure thing! I'll be right back, Dalia. I'll be right back, Orion. I'll be right back, Orion. Don't move from here, okay?                                                                         Orion: (Oh, jeez, I'm hard as a rock...) Um... s-sure! I won't go anywhere!                         Nancy: Good boy... Thank you.                                                                       Nancy and Gertrude leave the room. Following Nancy's instructions, you hide and wait for your       opportunity.                                                                                        Orion: (Okay Orion, it's time to leave the horny aside and focus. This is a golden chance to obtain vital info. Okay Orion, it's time to focus. This is a golden chance to obtain vital info. Don't     screw it up. I wait for that man to leave his office, I sneak into it, I search for info about      Thanatos' real identity, and I sneak out. Easy. I hope I can find it in time, though. I mean, I     should. I'm not Nova, but I know how to use Ctrl+F.)                                                You hear the creak of a door opening in the distance, followed by footsteps.                        Orion: (That's gotta be him! Let's go! The laptop! Nancy was right! Okay, I shouldn't waste a       second. Even if he doesn't know I was in here, I doubt he'll leave his laptop unprotected for too   long. Alright... I've gotta scan everything. Emails, archives, notes, hidden folders, cloud         storage... It has to be here.) . . . (There's only .csv files in here... Nothing over here either... No results for any of my keywords... Come on, come on, come on... Hmm? G.O.D. Reports. 10th Gem -  undiscovered. 9th Gem - undiscovered, 8th Gem - undiscovered. 7th Gem... Orion Richards, ID number  421,200,234! Holy shit, it's this! That's the Gem I found with Luna at the Red Herring server! The  one that Thanatos took from me in Ogygia! I bet he somehow had access to these files too. That's how he found me so fast after I retrieved the gem. So then... he must have some way to track players   down inside Eternum. I got you, motherfucker. One step closer to unraveling all your secrets. 1st   Gem... WYATT. R. PITMAN. Oh my god, all his fucking info is here! Born February 17th, 1999. 230 Old Ridge Trail, Evergreen, WA. Eternum ID number 002,155,727. This is way more than I thought I’d find! We... We know Thanatos' identity! But I can’t get too excited, I should make a run for it before   that guy gets back. Or... maybe I could try finding out something else?)                            Other Gem of Doom owners                                                                            Orion: (What about the other first owners? 6th Gem... Connor M. Kuvner. This has to be Xet's        brother. Thanatos stole their Gem in Ekabar. 5th Gem... Sugawara Tsuneo. Hmm... doesn't ring a bell. Maybe this is the one that's not in Thanatos' possession? 4th Gem... Sang Hyun-Ki. That's gotta be Garrington's Gem. I suspected that he didn't find it himself... it would be easier for him to buy   one, or have someone steal one for him. In any case, that's the Gem of Doom I have now. And the 2nd and 3rd Gems... A. Lopes and K. Dixon. Hmm, I don’t recognize either of them. But I guess it doesn't matter, Thanatos got to them long ago and stole their Gems. Hmm...)                                Next Ulysses' event                                                                                 Orion: (What about Ulysses' upcoming events... I heard some of them have very good rewards. Annie   got her swords in one of those. Hmm... there's a new special event scheduled for January. “The Big  Hunt.” Prize... TBD. There doesn't seem to be any further info about it. Too bad. We should look    into it...)                                                                                         The Founder                                                                                         Orion: (Maybe something about the Founder? Hmm... nothing. Not surprising. But look at this...      there's a notarized contract certifying that the person who collects all 10 Gems will receive       ownership of Ulysses and become its new CEO. Typical obfuscating legal language aside, there doesn’t seem to be any loophole here. It’s fairly straightforward. Interesting. This still doesn't answer  the biggest question, though: why is he doing this? Hmm...)                                         Leave                                                                                               Orion: (No, that's enough. I shouldn't risk it.)                                                    Clarence Ruiz: What the hell... Who the fuck are you?!                                              Orion: (Fuck...) T-This isn’t what it looks like, sir.                                              Clarence Ruiz: Are you trying to steal classified information from us?                              Orion: Um... Okay, maybe it is what it looks like, but I can explain! I-I just thought I could find a cheat code or something if I...                                                                   Clarence Ruiz: Don't bullshit me, kid. Did the Founder send you?                                    Orion: No one sent– Wait, the Founder...? Aren't you supposed to be working with him?               Clarence Ruiz: Fuck, William warned me that this could happen...                                    Orion: (William...? William Bardot? What’s going on?) Um... l-look, I didn't see anything, I swear. I'll leave immediately, but p-please, don't call the police.                                        Clarence Ruiz: The police...? No, the police can’t know about this, boy.                            Orion: What?                                                                                        Clarence Ruiz: I'm afraid you're not leaving this building on your own, son. My boss can’t know     about this slip-up.                                                                                 Orion: W-What...?                                                                                   Clarence Ruiz: Someone probably should have taught you this lesson long ago. This is what happens   when you mess around where you shouldn't.                                                           Orion: O-Okay, I think I'm gonna–                                                                   Clarence Ruiz: Do you think you're the first one to try this? Fucking fools like you think all of   this is nothing more than a game, and when they realize the truth... it's already too late.         Orion: (I don't like this...)                                                                       Clarence Ruiz: I'm sorry, but this is how it has to be. You. Don't. Fuck. With.                     Nancy: . . .                                                                                        Orion: . . . H-Holy shit!                                                                           Nancy: Orion! Are you okay? I'm sorry, I thought he'd go to the front desk, but for some reason he  turned around and came back here instead.                                                           Orion: I’m fine! Damn, good hit, Nancy! You saved me!                                               Nancy: He'll probably be sleeping for a while, but we should tie him up, just in case. Can you help me?                                                                                                 Orion: O-Of course!                                                                                 You muzzle Clarence’s mouth and tie up his hands and feet.                                          Nancy: There you go! Now be good and stay quiet!                                                    Orion: Phew, okay, this certainly wasn't part of the plan.                                          Nancy: It wasn't, for sure. I'm sorry, Orion, I didn't want to get you into this mess.              Orion: Will we get in trouble somehow?                                                              Nancy: I don't think so. No one apart from Gertrude knows you're here, and I convinced her to leave already. And honestly, I don't think he'll even try to contact security. He sounded too proud for   that. Regardless, I’ll stop by security and see if I can sway them, if necessary.                   Orion: And he’s way too scared of his superiors. I'm sure he won't say a thing.                     Nancy: We should leave the building immediately, though. Just in case.                              Orion: Agreed. And hey, let's celebrate! The mission was still a success! I discovered Thanatos'    real identity!                                                                                      Nancy: Oh! Now we're talking! That's my boy...                                                      Orion: I've got everything on him. Real name, ID number, and even his address!                      Nancy: Really? Where does he live? Do I need to start looking for flights to Zimbabwe?              Orion: That's the best part! He's American! He lives in Evergreen, Washington!                      Nancy: Hmmm... That's kind of close, actually. Maybe a 5-hour drive.                                Orion: It is.                                                                                       Nancy: Hmmm... Are you thinking what I'm thinking...?                                               Orion: Well, if you're thinking about getting in the car and driving 5 hours right now to plant     Nova's device and get that bastard where he’d never expect it... Then yes, we're thinking the same  thing.                                                                                              Nancy: *Giggles* You seem too excited about this.                                                   Orion: I mean, stealing 5 Gems of Doom from Eternum's number one player is exciting in its own      right. But, I also have a little vendetta to settle...                                              Nancy: I see... I'll admit that I’m pretty tempted to ambush him now too.                           Orion: Alright then... The mission continues?                                                       Nancy: Definitely.                                                                                  Orion: Let's go! Where did we leave the car? Was it floor negative 8? It was that one, right?       *Clicking on the button* Yeah, I think so. Alright! Let's recap what we know so far. We know        Thanatos' real identity. If we manage to steal his Gems of Doom, we'll have a total of 6, if we     include the one in our possession. Then there's another one in the hands of an unknown player...    who's probably not the first owner. We know initial owners get their names recorded, and given that Thanatos hasn't been able to track them down, it’s likely the Gem has transferred hands. And        finally, there are 3 Gems still hidden in the world of Eternum.                                     Nancy: . . .                                                                                        Orion: Um... Nancy? Are you listening to me?                                                        Nancy: Yeah... Can I ask you something, Orion?                                                      Orion: Huh? Of course. What's the matter?                                                           Nancy: It's just that... *Chuckles* I feel so silly. You know, I might not look like it, but I've   been through a lot. And over the years, I’ve gotten to know myself pretty well. I know what I want. But... I was young myself once. And I feel like I've been acting on my own without actually thinking about you.                                                                                         Orion: Huh? (What’s gotten into her?)                                                               I just want what's best for you                                                                     Orion: I just want what's best for you. I want to see you happy. I'll do anything within my reach to accomplish that!                                                                                   Nancy: . . . You're too kind, Orion. *Chuckles* That might come back around to bite you someday. But thank you, I'm glad to hear that.                                                                  Maybe we should forget about “us” until...                                                          Orion: Maybe we should forget about “us” until we've dealt with the whole Gems thing. We have a lot on our plates.                                                                                      Nancy: . . . Yeah, that's... exactly what I meant. *Chuckles* I mean, just look at everything that’s happened to us. The war at Semper Invicta, the risk with Penelope, Dalia, and Annie... even        Gertrude interrupted us! And that's not even taking into account our age difference or my background as your old nanny. Everything's just... too complicated. I'm sorry, Orion. I didn’t mean to make   you uncomfortable.                                                                                  Orion: Nonsense. I forbid you from making this something awkward. But, as you said, it's just better if we don't overcomplicate things. You haven’t stopped being sexy as fuck, though. Don't blame me  if I keep dropping my jaw when I see you.                                                           Nancy: *Chuckles* I won't, I promise. And you! Try not to walk around shirtless! It’ll drive me     crazy!                                                                                              Orion: *Chuckles* I can try. Alright, now that that's clear... ready to continue our mission, ma'am?Nancy: Ready as I'll ever be.                                                                       Orion: Then let's go!                                                                               I know what I want, too                                                                             Orion: I know what I want, too. And I wanna be with you. You can call me selfish.                   Nancy: . . . I see... That's good to know. *Sighs* It's just that... I've been thinking, you know?  Orion: (Oof, thinking is not good...)                                                               Nancy: Our age difference, my daughters, the Student Exchange Program, my history as your former    nanny... And also my job, and everything that we've got going on with Eternum and Ulysses.          Everything's just... so complicated.                                                                Orion: (Aw, shit, I don’t like where this is going...)                                              Nancy: *Chuckles* Every single time we’ve tried... something, we were interrupted. Penelope, Dalia, Annie, Gertrude, Maximo... There's always something stopping us, as if... as if we’re not meant to  take that next step. It’s like we’re fighting against fate or destiny or something like that.       Orion: W-What? That's absurd! All this destiny thing is such bull–                                  Nancy presses the emergency stop button.                                                            Orion: W-What are you doing?! Nancy?                                                                The elevator's emergency lights flash on.                                                           Orion: Oh...                                                                                        Nancy: But then I thought... ...fuck that. If destiny doesn't want to give me an opportunity... I'll create my own. I'll take what I want. And what I want... is you, Orion.                            Orion: I like that way of thinking...                                                               Nancy: What about you? Do you know what you want...?                                                Orion: *Caressing her cheek* Fuck, Nancy... You know exactly what I want. We still have a yoga      session pending, don't we?                                                                          Nancy: Ah, you're very right, mister. What an eager boy...                                          Orion: Should we continue it now?                                                                   Nancy: Hmmm... now seems like as good a time as any...                                              Orion: Maybe we should get a bit more comfortable, then. These clothes look a little restrictive... Do you mind if I help you get rid of them...?                                                       Nancy: Mm-hm...                                                                                     You rip off the buttons of Nancy's blouse, revealing her bra and increasing your temptation to      unfathomable levels.                                                                                Orion: Fuck, yes... I'm gonna eat you up, Nancy...                                                  Nancy: *Pushing you against the wall* Oh no, no chance! That already happened last time, remember?  Now... it's my turn. Let your mommy take care of you. You’ve been such a good boy, after all... Let me take care of you...                                                                              Orion: With pleasure...                                                                             Nancy: Any special requests...?                                                                     Orion: Hmm... Take off your bra. I wanna see those perfectly shaped tits of yours again...          Nancy: Oh my, are you not excited enough? Wanna play with my titties in front of your face again,   baby boy? Oh my, are you not excited enough? Wanna play with my titties in front of your face       again?                                                                                              Orion: You could say that... I’ve always been more of a... tactile learner. Just the idea of your   tits isn’t enough for a hedonist like me...                                                         Nancy: *Giggles* I don't know, you look plenty excited to me, Orion. That bulge in your pants gives you away.                                                                                           Orion: You're denying my request, then? Such a tease...                                             Nancy: Oh, not at all. I’m just trying to take back some control of the situation... can’t have you getting too antsy, sweetheart... But... it'd be very rude if I refused.                             Orion: That's it, Mommy... That's it, Nancy...                                                      Nancy removes her bra, exposing her hefty tits to the cold elevator air.                            Orion: Oh god... Can you... can you give me a little spin?                                          Nancy: *Giggles* You're wasting your time, Orion. This emergency stop is only temporary. If someone calls for the elevator, it’ll start up again... Tick, tock, Orion...                                Orion: I don't give a fuck. I've been craving this moment for so long... nothing’s gonna stop me    from enjoying this to the fullest.                                                                  Nancy: *Chuckles* Living in the present, eh?                                                        Orion: Life is too short to never take risks...                                                     Nancy: I couldn't agree more. As long as what you do doesn't hurt anyone... sometimes you’ve gotta  just take a chance.                                                                                 Orion: Taking a chance, eh? Maybe I should start taking more chances with you, too.                 Nancy: I’d like to see you try, Orion... *Kneeling down* You know, my mother used to say that       risk-takers defy destiny with every decision. I’ve always kept that thought in my head.             Orion: Very wise woman, indeed...                                                                   Nancy: Jesus... What do they feed you boys nowadays?                                                Orion: Do you like what you see?                                                                    Nancy reaches out and gently wraps her hand around your meat, before slapping it across her cheek.  Orion: O-Oh, god...                                                                                 Nancy: Y-yeah, I guess you could say I like it...                                                   Orion: Fuck, Nancy... You have me throbbing...                                                      Nancy: You sure have a lot of love to give, Orion.                                                  Orion: What can I say, hot red-headed MILFs are my weakness...                                      Nancy: MILFs, eh? I thought you’d have been playing around with all those younger girls... Were you actually saving your loads for mommy...? Were you actually saving your loads for me...?             Orion: You can have as many loads as you want...                                                    Nancy moves her tongue southward and begins giving small licks to your balls.                       Orion: O-O-Ohh...                                                                                   Nancy: *Giggles* Mmmm... guess I’ve gotta check what you’ve been saving for me...                   Orion: Take it into your mouth, please... I need it...                                              Nancy: Mmmm...                                                                                      Orion: Oh my god...                                                                                 Nancy: Mmmm...                                                                                      Orion: Oh... Nancy... That's it... suck it fast... AAaaaahhh... That's it... J-Jesus Christ, this   feels too good...                                                                                   Nancy’s pillowy lips wrap around your girth, and you can’t help but let out a noise.                Nancy: *Moaning* MMmMmm...                                                                          Orion: Keep looking in my eyes, Nancy...                                                            Nancy: Mmmm...                                                                                      Orion: (I’ve known Nancy all my life... yet I’m still not used to the size of her enormous bust...  All those years, and still no sag... No back problems, either.)                                     Nancy: *Gagging* MmmMmmm...                                                                         Orion: (Hmm... between Nancy and Penelope... I wonder who's got the bigger pair... Penny did say    that Nancy has a habit of stealing her bras... Man, I wish I could compare the two pairs. Mother and daughter...)                                                                                       Nancy: *Gagging* Mmmggghh...                                                                        Orion: Aghhh... yeah... Keep pumping it, Nancy...                                                   Nancy continues to milk your cock with a steady rhythm, as her expressions grow more and more       lecherous.                                                                                          Orion: AAaahh... G-God, how long can you keep that pace? D-Don't you need to breathe?               Nancy: Mmmm...? *Catching her breath* I'm just breathing through my nose. You can reduce stress and anxiety just by controlling your breathing. You can learn a lot from yoga.                          Orion: Ah, I guess that–                                                                            Nancy envelops your shaft inside her mouth before you can even finish your sentence.                Orion: A-a-a-a-aaaahhh... Jesus... (I was hoping she’d be good at this, but she's blown me away...) Aaaahhh, yeah, that’s it... (Nancy doesn’t seem to be interested in stopping before sucking the life out of me...) Please, Nancy, don't stop...                                                         Nancy: *Recovering her breath* AAAghh... FUCK!                                                      Orion: Ah, your nose-breathing technique failed you?                                                Nancy: I guess I'll have to keep training...                                                        Orion: I think I have some free time for practice between our yoga sessions...                      Nancy: Good idea! But for today... I have something else in mind.                                   Orion: Oh... and what might that be...?                                                             Nancy pulls you to the ground and swings her leg over you.                                          Orion: Oh boy... Wait... You're not wearing panties?                                                Nancy: *Straddling you and lifting her skirt* I guess I woke up a little naughty today.             Orion: What a naughty mommy... How naughty...                                                       Nancy: You had no right to turn my life upside down like this, Orion. I can't get you out of my     head. Every single minute. Every single day. I... NEED you... inside me...                          Orion: Oh my god... Are we... Are we really gonna do this? Are we...                                Nancy: Yes, we are. We're gonna continue right where we left off last time, Orion. I promised you,  remember?                                                                                           Orion: Oh fuck, yes... (Oh my god, I'm about to fuck Nancy. S-She's about to fuck me! Is this really gonna happen?)                                                                                     Nancy: Yes, it IS going to happen.                                                                  Orion: W-What? Can you read my mind?                                                                Nancy: Your face is like an open book, Orion.                                                       Orion: Oh... I can imagine... I can't help but get the feeling we're about to get interrupted once  again. Right before the best moment. Something's gonna happen...                                    Nancy: *Giggles* Hmm. Not this time, baby boy. This time, I won't let anything or anyone stop me.   This time... You're all mine...                                                                     Orion: O-Oh my god... AAaaaaahh...                                                                  Nancy: *Squeals* AAAAAAaaaaagggghh... Y-YEAH! A-Are you ready...?                                   Orion: O-O-Oh, god... OH M-MY FUCKING GOD...                                                        Nancy starts moving up and down. Your penis spreads her wet lips apart, while quickly adjusting to  the redhead's vicious pace.                                                                         Nancy: O-Oh m-my g-goddd, Orion.... *Moaning* This is... AAaahhh... T-This is it... You're finally  inside me, baby...                                                                                  Orion: F-FUUUUCK...                                                                                 Nancy: *Moaning* Y-You have no idea how long I've been... AAhhh... ...how long I've been fantasizing about this moment...                                                                               Orion: F-Fuck, me too, Nancy... Your pussy feels so good... (I'm inside Nancy... I'm fucking her... This is not a dream, it's happening...)                                                             Nancy: *Moaning* Aaaahh... AAAaaahhh...                                                             Orion: G-God...                                                                                     Nancy: D-Does it feel good, Orion?                                                                  Orion: *Panting* I've never felt anything so incredible... You f-feel... absurdly good.             Nancy: I can feel your cock f-filling me... aahh... every inch of it pumping in and out of me...    S-So much.... *Squeals* AAaaghh... I bet you must drive the girls at your school crazy...           Orion: W-Well... T-Truth is, I've never done something like this in the real world. T-Truth is, I've never done something like this.                                                                    Nancy: Oh... well... Let me show you what you've been missing, then...                              Orion: Oh fuck yes...                                                                               Nancy: MmmmMm... I-I want more... I need more, baby...                                              Orion: More?                                                                                        Nancy: Can you handle me going faster, sweetie? I’ll start slowly... and it’ll make your mommy feel so much better... Can you handle me going faster, sweetie? I’ll start slowly... and it’ll make your old babysitter feel so much better...                                                               Orion: F-Faster? Y-Yeah, I can take it...                                                           Nancy: That's my boy...                                                                             Nancy gets off of you and removes her skirt.                                                        Orion: *Panting* O-Okay, I just need a second. (Come on, Orion, you can do it. Don't cum yet, don't cum yet, don't cum yet, don't cum yet.)                                                             Nancy: You good?                                                                                    Orion: Y-Yeah! I'm fine!                                                                            Nancy hops back onto you and guides your member into herself once more.                             Nancy: Good...                                                                                      Orion: O-Oh god...                                                                                  Nancy: Because...                                                                                   Orion: S-Shiiiit...                                                                                 Nancy: Because I don't plan to stop riding you until one of us faints...                            Orion: Oh boy...                                                                                    Nancy: *Panting* AHHH... F-FUCKKK!                                                                  Orion: OH GOD...                                                                                    Nancy: R-RIGHT THERE!                                                                               Orion: Oh, fuck yeah, Nancy...                                                                      Nancy: AAAAHGH...                                                                                   Nancy's pussy stretches around you, her wet folds surrounding the entire length of your dick. The   relentless onslaught of her hips is somehow balanced by the dance that her perfect breasts perform  in front of you.                                                                                    Orion: Jesus Christ...                                                                              Nancy: YEAH... YEAH! G-God, I needed this so much, Orion... Y-You have no idea... All this time...  Everything is paying off for this one moment...                                                     Orion: AAahhh... Y-Yes... FUCK YES! Are you enjoying riding me, Nancy?                              Nancy: Fuck yes, I am...                                                                            Orion: Have you ever taken a cock like mine?                                                        Nancy: N-Not even close... AAAAAHHH...                                                              Nancy's screams fill the small enclosed space, echoing against the high ceiling.                    Orion: (I wonder how thick the walls of the elevator are... could anyone hear us?)                  Nancy: Y-YEAH!                                                                                      Orion: G-God... I-I hope there are no security cameras in the elevator.                             Nancy: H-HAH! T-That would be quite the spectacle, eh...? The poor security guard having to watch   the two of us – AGH... FUCK! – h-having sweaty, animal sex in an elevator in the middle of the      day... O-One for the spank bank, for s-sure...                                                      Orion: I b-bet...                                                                                   Nancy: AAahh... Luckily there are no cameras in this one, since it doesn't go to the labs...        Orion: Too bad... I'd have liked to take a souvenir home...                                         Nancy: AAAhh... *Panting* Jesus, my legs are going numb... I'm not sure I can...                    Without letting her finish her sentence, you grab her tightly and begin to slam her.                Nancy: AAAAAaaaGHH, BABYYYYY! *Gritting her teeth* M-MY GOD!                                        Orion: AAAaghh, fuck, Nancy...                                                                      Nancy: *Squealing* J-Jesus Christ, y-you're like a fucking bull...                                  Orion: All I wish to do is to serve my queen...                                                     Nancy: AAAGH... Y-Yeah... That's it... Harder... H-HARDER! Fuck your queen, Orion... F-Fuck your    queen with that m-monster fucking cock of yours... AAAAghh!                                         Orion: *Panting* I can feel you soaking my balls with your juices...                                Nancy: AAAhhh F-FUCK, t-this is insaaaanee... AAAAH!                                                Orion: Let me hear you scream like that... I fucking love making you feel that way...               Nancy's voice rises in pitch as you hammer away inside her, fucking her for all you're worth.       Nancy: *Screaming* AAAAAAAGHHH!                                                                     Orion: Oh f-fuck yeah!                                                                              Nancy: *Squealing* AAAAaaaaaahh....                                                                 Orion: What a naughty mommy... what if your daughters could see you being fucked like this? What a  naughty empress... what if your subjects could see you being fucked like this?                      Nancy: *Screaming* AAAAAaahh...                                                                     Orion: Do you like being fucked roughly by me?                                                      Nancy: I-I LOVE IT... AAAaahh...                                                                    Orion: I knew it...                                                                                 Nancy: *Panting* M-Make me yours, Orion...                                                          Each wild slam of your hips hits the deepest parts of Nancy’s inner cavity.                         Nancy: Oh m-my god, I'm gonna cum, Orion... You're gonna make me cum... Keep fucking me like this,  please... I-I'm almost there... AAAAAAHHH... J-Just a bit more, baby... M-Make your mommy cum!      M-Make your queen cum! AAAAAAARGH!!!!                                                               Nancy's body trembles as wave after wave of pleasure runs through her entire body. Her thighs       squeeze against you, and you wince from the stress of not cumming right then.                       Nancy: *Recovering her breath* My god... GGGGggghh... This one was even better than the orgasms you gave me in Semper Invicta... *Struggling to her feet* Dear Lord... How the hell do you do it...     Orion: *Pushing her against the wall* Come here...                                                  Nancy: *Panting* W-What are you doing...                                                            Orion: We're not done yet, Nancy...                                                                 Nancy: W-What? I-I can't continue! I'm exhausted, Orion...                                          Orion: Don't worry, my queen, just lean against the wall and let me do the work here...             Nancy: *Giggles* Y-you're fucking nuts. Are you never satiated?                                     Orion: I could never get my fill of you...                                                          Nancy: AAAAAARGGGHH... g-good Lord have mercy... *Screaming* AHHHH!                                 Orion: M-My god... Your pussy is so fucking addictive... I can't stop myself...                     Nancy: AAAahh... D-Don't stop then... F-Fuck me again, Orion... P-Pin me against the wall and       fucking lay into me!! GGGGaghh! M-Make a mess of me, baby...                                        Orion: I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you...                                                        Nancy: Oh my gggawd...                                                                              Orion: (It’s taken me everything I have not to cum already. I want this sensation to last as long as possible, but... I can’t help but want to pound Nancy’s cunt until I collapse...) Oh, Nancy...     Nancy: Ohgaaawf...                                                                                  Orion: (She's completely gone... the things she's saying don't even make sense anymore.)            You pump your cock in and out of Nancy's lascivious body for several minutes until her ass cheeks   start reddening.                                                                                    Orion: (Think I can shift up one more gear...)                                                      Nancy: *Screaming* AAAAAAAGH... AAAAH!                                                              Orion: Oh god, Nancy, I'm getting close...                                                          Nancy: I'm c-c-cummingg already... a-again.....                                                     Orion: I'm g-gonna cum too...                                                                       Nancy: *Panting* I-If you’re gonna cum, then cum, baby... *Panting* Don’t worry about this being the only time we do this... I p-promise we’ll do it again... Now cum for me, let me take care of you... Cum for mommy, baby... Cum for your queen, baby... G-GOD!                                          Orion: FUUUUCK, I'M...                                                                              Nancy: W-WAIT! D-D-DON'T CUM INSIDE!!                                                               Orion: I'm almost there...                                                                          Nancy: N-Not inside! AAAHhh! I c-can't have another child!                                          Orion: *Panting* W-Would that be that bad...? Look at these hips, Nancy... I’m p-pretty sure you’re meant to have some more kids...                                                                     Nancy: Orion s-s-stop joking!                                                                       Orion: Oh fuck... (Oh god, this is gonna be harder than she thinks... I wanna fill her up so        badly... I can’t upset her, though... not if I want to do this again... Oh fuck, I'm gonna–)        You pull out at the last second.                                                                    Orion: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH... AAAaaaaaahh...                                                         Nancy: *Orgasming again* AAaaaahh...                                                                Orion: *Hyperventilating* Jesus fucking Christ... Oh Nancy... I don’t think I've ever cummed so hard in my life...                                                                                      Nancy: *Exhausted chuckle* Hah... Is it that bad?                                                   Orion: Well, you're definitely gonna need a shower when you get home... God... Nancy, this was...   Nancy: *Still breathing heavily* D-Don't even try it. I can’t describe it either... Where did you   learn to– *Leaning against the wall* Oh no.                                                         Orion: What's this?                                                                                 Nancy: T-The elevator! Someone called it!                                                           Orion: W-What?!                                                                                     Nancy: F-Fuck, they can't find me like this! What if it's my boss? They're gonna fire me! I can't be fired, Orion, I have a family to feed!                                                             Orion: T-Then get dressed!                                                                          Nancy: Yes... YES! My clothes! P-Pass me my blouse!                                                 Orion: And the bra?                                                                                 Nancy: There's no time! H-Hide it in your pants or something!                                       Orion: Uh, kinky...                                                                                 Nancy: N-Not now, Orion!                                                                            Gertrude: Oh! Nancy! You're still here? I thought you left! And hi again, Dalia. And hi again,      Orion.                                                                                              Orion: H-Hi Gerty.                                                                                  Nancy: *Coming out of the elevator* G-Gertrude! I-I was about to ask you the same thing. I thought  you left like... an hour ago.                                                                       Gertrude: Yeah, I did, but then I noticed I left my binder on my desk, so I had to come back to get it.                                                                                                 Nancy: Awww, I'm so sorry, they locked the office already!                                          Gertrude: They... locked it? Why?                                                                   Nancy: You know, the... fumigation.                                                                 Gertrude: Fumigation...?                                                                            Nancy: Yeah! You didn't get the memo?                                                               Gertrude: The... o-oh! Of course, of course, I was the first one to get it.                         Nancy: Yeah, we should go back home, things can get pretty dangerous with all the chemical agents   and everything.                                                                                     Gertrude: Of course. Let's leave before it ruins our perfect skin! See you tomorrow, I guess?       Nancy: S-Sure! Same time, same desk. Anyways... I've gotta leave you now, we were going to... visit a friend.                                                                                           Orion: Yep!                                                                                         Gertrude: Sure thing, Nan. Before you leave, though... I've gotta ask, do you know you're going     around without shoes?                                                                               Nancy: Oh! I must have left them in my office! I'm such a scatterbrain. How embarrassing.           Orion: You had an extra pair in the car, if I remember correctly!                                   Nancy: Ah, you're very right! I should go get them before I slip on something or hurt my feet...    *Clears throat* Alright, I'll see you tomorrow! Goodbye, Gerty!                                     Gertrude: See you tomorrow, Nan! I'll be in the salon if you wanna drop by later!                   Nancy: *Walking out the door* Sounds wonderful!                                                     Gertrude: Well... I guess I'll go back to my car too, I don't wanna get contaminated. *Sniffing*    Ugh, these elevators smell more and more like sweat everyday. They should fire the entire cleaning  staff. And... are those Nancy's shoes? She left them inside the elevator! This woman is a total     scatterbrain... Good thing she has someone as observant as me in her life...                        Orion: *Snoring softly* Zzzzzz...                                                                   Nancy: Wake up, Orion! We're here!                                                                  Orion: Hmmm? (Where am I...? This...) Oh, right! Thanatos! Man, I knocked out as soon as the car    drove off.                                                                                          Nancy: Yeah, you really needed the rest! *Chuckles* Your eye bags were starting to terrorize        children.                                                                                           Orion: *Stretching your legs* AGHH! Ahh, I feel like a new man! How long was I out?                 Nancy: Almost 6 hours!                                                                              Orion: Not bad. Damn, I had such a great dream, though... There was action and fear and espionage... but the best part was that it ended with me having sex with a hot redhead in an elevator.          Nancy: *Giggles* Oh, really? And how was that?                                                      Orion: Unforgettable...                                                                             Nancy: Wow, look at that smile on your face. Seems like you definitely enjoyed yourself.            Orion: You took the words right out of my mouth. She gave me the ride of my life. If I close my     eyes, I can still see her gorgeous body absolutely hammering me into the ground... *Sighs* The sad  thing about dreams is that they always seem to fade away after a while. Do you think I'll ever be   able to dream about that redhead again...?                                                          Nancy: I don't know... Maybe if you're good, karma will reward you... and the woman will pay you    another visit...                                                                                    Orion: Damn, seems like I should be on my best behavior then.                                       Nancy: Sounds like it! But maybe don’t be too much of a goody two-shoes... Fortune favors the bold. Orion: Ah, I'll keep it in mind...                                                                  Nancy: *Chuckles* Let's keep these dreams of yours between us, though. I don’t know how my daughters would take the news.                                                                               Orion: My lips are sealed!                                                                          Nancy: *Giggles* Mm-hm.                                                                             Orion: God, that gave me enough fuel to run across the country. I'm filled with energy and ready to kick some ass! Let's plant Nova's device and steal those Gems! I'm filled with energy and ready to  kick some ass! Let's plant Nova's device and steal those Gems! Which way, ma'am?                    Nancy: Well, about that... we're already there, actually. This is the place.                        Orion: Oh? T-This is... Thanatos' home? Are you sure?                                               Nancy: Yep.                                                                                         Orion: Isn't this a bit risky? I thought we'd park away from the house.                             Nancy: That was my plan too, but I lost the GPS signal shortly after taking this road. Before I knew it, we were right in front of the house.                                                           Orion: I see. It looks a bit...                                                                     Nancy: Abandoned, right?                                                                            Orion: Yeah...                                                                                      Nancy: There's almost nothing else within a 10-mile radius, and I didn't see any other vehicle on   the way up here, so it's definitely empty.                                                          Orion: Strange. Maybe it's a second home?                                                           Nancy: I don't know... if it is, they left it to decay, that's for sure.                            Orion: Do you still want to go take a look?                                                         Nancy: Yeah, it's the least we should do after coming all the way up here.                          Orion: I agree. Let me go first. If by chance someone is inside, we're a door-to-door Bible salesman and his hot assistant.                                                                             Nancy: And where are the Bibles you're selling, Mr. Bible salesman?                                 Orion: Trust me, they'll be too busy checking out my hot assistant to notice anything strange.      Nancy: *Chuckles* Okay, okay, if you say so... you go first. I’ll follow you.                       Orion: Should we knock?                                                                             Nancy: Um... well, I would.                                                                         Orion: But what if Thanatos himself is really living here?                                          Nancy: Hmm... maybe knock and hide by the door. Let me do the talking. He doesn't know who I am, we have an advantage.                                                                                  Orion: True that. *Taking a deep breath* Alright, here goes nothing.                                The door of the old house swings open at your slightest touch.                                      Orion: *Gulps* Well... that pretty much confirms it. This place was abandoned long ago. *Going into the house* Jeez, everything's falling apart.                                                        Nancy: Yeah, watch your step.                                                                       Orion: Abandoned places have always given me the creeps. Thank god we arrived before nightfall.     Nancy: I feel kind of uncomfortable here. Trespassing like this, y’know?                            Orion: It's a deserted house, don't worry. The door wasn't even locked. And there aren’t any cars   around.                                                                                             Nancy: But take a look at this. It's full of... junk. As if the people who lived here had to run    away all of a sudden, without being able to pack their things. Either that, or there are actually   people still living here.                                                                           Orion: I don't know... Let's go take a quick look upstairs, and then get out of here.               Nancy: What's over there?                                                                           Orion: Nothing, just a bathroom. And there?                                                         Nancy: Just a small bedroom.                                                                        You and Nancy go down the end of the hall, and find another empty bedroom.                          Orion: And... nothing.                                                                              Nancy: *Sighs* What a disappointment. *Sitting down* We came all this way for nothing. It isn't even worth leaving Nova's device here, and we haven’t found any clues. I guess we got too excited, too  soon.                                                                                               Orion: Don't say that! We still have Thanatos' real name, and this was the address he had when he   registered to play Eternum. Let's call Nova! Maybe he moved somewhere nearby, I'm sure she'll be    able to find out his current address.                                                               Nancy: That's a good idea. Will she answer if you call her now?                                     Orion: *Chuckles* I'd bet anything that she will. Ever since she got her first phone, it's been like a new toy for her. If she doesn't answer she's either sleeping or playing Eternum. There's no other possibility.                                                                                       Nova: I was just thinking about you! Hey, Orion. What's new with you?                               Orion: Well, well, well... it took you a whopping 2 seconds to answer the phone this time, Nova. Is everything alright? Did something happen?                                                           Nova: It's not my fault! I was on the other side of the room sorting my manga collection. That's    like... a solid 10 feet! And well, I'm still a little hungover, so that slowed my speed.            Orion: Yeah, I meant to ask you about that, are you feeling better?                                 Nova: Definitely! I got up at 3 PM, took a shower, washed out the blue dye from my hair, scarfed    down some food, and... well, it's been raining since then, so I didn't do much else. Ah, and my mom scolded me for having my eye uncovered for so long last night.                                      Orion: Oh, right! Does it hurt you now?                                                             Nova: Not at all! I mean... well, it hurt a little when I came back from the party, but... nothing  to worry about. I know my limits. My mom’s just being a worrywart. And well, I'm still a little     hungover, so that slowed my speed.                                                                  Orion: *Awkward laugh* Oh... yeah, the party... I'm sorry I left early, I wasn't feeling that well. Nova: It's okay, don't worry. We left early as well. Penny looked a bit sad, though. Or... maybe she was mad. I'm not sure.                                                                             Orion: (Oh shit, I hope she's not angry with me.)                                                   Nova: But anyway, what are you up to? How did the mission go? Do you have Thanatos' name?           Nancy: We do!                                                                                       Nova: Oh, hi, Nancy! That's great news!                                                             Nancy: We even found the address he used to initially register with Ulysses! Since it was relatively close, we decided to come immediately. Unfortunately, the house is completely abandoned.           Nova: Agh, that sucks. Maybe he moved?                                                              Nancy: Yeah, we thought the same. Would you be able to discover his current address if we gave you  his name?                                                                                           Nova: Please, that's like asking a weightlifting champ if he can do 10 pushups. Easy peasy! I just  need his full name, and I'll be able to give you his current address and all of his social networks in less than... 15 seconds.                                                                         Orion: Really? And how are you gonna do that?                                                       Nova: A magician never reveals her tricks, Orion!                                                   Nancy: Okay, so... his name is Wyatt R. Pitman. He was born on February 17, 1999. And the address he registered with was 230 Old Ridge Trail, Evergreen, WA.                                            Nova: Got it! Give me one second... And... Uh... Wyatt R. Pitman, Evergreen, you said? W-Y-A-T-T R  P-I-T-M-A-N?                                                                                        Nancy: Yes! Is there any problem?                                                                   Nova: Um... I have bad news, guys. That guy is not Thanatos. Must be a fake name. He's cleverer than we thought...                                                                                      Nancy: Huh? Why are you so sure?                                                                    Nova: Well... you were right, he did move 5 years ago. His new address is... Section 8, Stone 19,   Evergreen Cemetery. He's... dead.                                                                   Nancy: What?! Wyatt R. Pitman died 5 years ago?! Are you sure?                                      Nova: A hundred percent. Thanatos must be using fake identities of dead people to cover his tracks. Would go with the whole “Greek god of death” thing. Although... he shouldn't be able to. I guess    that reinforces our theory that he's working for Ulysses.                                           Nancy: Agh... that's bad news. We might be back to square one. *Sighs* Anyway, thank you, Nova.     Nova: Is there anything else you need?                                                              Nancy: Not right now... but thank you so much. We'll start heading back to Kredon now.              Nova: Okie-dokie! I'm gonna play Eternum for a bit with Alex and Dalia. But let me know when you're back! Maybe you can join! See you later!                                                            Orion: Goodbye, Nova! Have fun! And thanks once again, number one hacker girl!                      Nancy: *Sighs* What a waste of time... We really got too ahead of ourselves...                      Orion: Don't say that! We had to try it, it was too good of an opportunity. So no long faces! Come  on, let's go back to Kredon. And let’s get something to eat along the way! My treat!                Nancy: *Chuckles* How do you do it, Orion?                                                          Orion: Huh? Do what?                                                                                Nancy: Always staying positive. You’re so optimistic! During this Thanatos scheme, during the heist, even during the gladiator fight in Semper Invicta! You never seem to falter.                       Orion: Oh... well, I don't know, I've always been a pretty hopeful person. You have to fuck with me a LOT to make me upset. Unless you mess with someone I care about - then it’s a different story     entirely. I learned long ago that a half-full glass is better than a half-empty one. At the end of  the day, all I can do is keep moving forward.                                                       Nancy: But the thing is that... it's not just you moving forward. I'm not sure how you do it, but   you make others feel good too. Your optimism, your reassurance... it’s contagious. You have a gift! Even if you don't realize it yourself.                                                              Orion: *Chuckles* I'm not so sure, to be honest. I’ve met a lot of people who can't stand me. But   thank you, Nancy. Your words are really touching... but I have to imagine that a lot of this        optimism stuff is due to you. Growing up under your care really affected me.                        Nancy: Me? I don’t think so. I forced myself to swallow my tears and my pain when things went south a few years ago. I kept a mask on because I was afraid that it would scare or hurt my daughters. And as they grew up, they started copying that same approach. They hide their insecurities, their      fears. They always pretend to be happy, and they’ve gotten so good at it that sometimes even I can’t tell what’s an act. But... when they're with you... their smiles are genuine. The laughs are real. You’ve really made the household... authentic. It’s almost like we were missing something before you came back.                                                                                         Orion: Come off it! You don't need me for all that! All I do is point out everything that’s already around you, I didn’t add anything special.                                                          Nancy: But that’s not an easy thing to do, Orion. People spend their lives trying to overcome       insecurities. Even the prettiest girls feel ugly sometimes. The people who are always cracking jokes and leaving others with smiles on their faces... you’d be surprised how many of them cry at night. Even the most independent or popular girls feel alone. We might all be living different lives,      but... when it comes down to it, we're all fighting the same monsters. I know that what I'm about to say might sound really selfish, but...  Don't leave us again, Orion. We need you. More than you    think.                                                                                              Orion: Well, I don't know what life or the future or destiny hold in store for me, but I can promise you one thing, Nancy. I'll never leave you or the girls again. I swear on my life.                 You slowly stand up and turn around. An old woman points a double-barreled shotgun at you with      trembling hands.                                                                                    Orion: *Putting your hands up* O-Okay... C-Calm down everyone...                                    Old lady: W-WHO ARE YOU?! WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?!                                          Orion: I-I'm gonna need you to put the gun down...                                                  Old lady: SHUT UP! You here to rob me? I have n-nothing! NOTHING!                                   Nancy: We didn't come to steal from you! We... Please, calm down, we mean no harm!                  Old lady: Then why are you trespassing in my house?! If you try to trick me, I'm gonna shoot you    both! I’ve got nothing to lose!                                                                     Nancy: Okay, okay! Please just hear us out! We'll tell you the truth! We... We came here to find a  man named Wyatt Pitman and-                                                                         Wyatt's mother: What do you want from my son?! He's dead! Can't you let him rest in peace?          Nancy: T-That's the thing! We got the wrong person! We came looking for someone, and we mixed him up with your son! I-I know that we shouldn't have entered without permission, but the door was        unlocked and... well, anyway, that doesn’t really matter. I'm so sorry for your loss, Ms. Pitman. We didn't mean to offend you or Wyatt's memory in any way.                                            Wyatt's mother: *Breathing nervously* So... You didn't come to rob me?                              Nancy: Of course not! I swear on my daughters!                                                      Wyatt's mother: . . . Y-You're... You're a mother too?                                              Nancy: I am. I have two girls, Dalia and Penelope. The younger one will start college next fall, and the older one will graduate in a couple of years.                                                  Wyatt's mother: . . .                                                                               The old woman drops the shotgun on the ground.                                                      Orion: (Oh Jesus, thank fucking god...)                                                             Wyatt's mother: I'm sorry. I... I've been alone since my Wyatt left me 5 years ago. It was just me  and him for years, after his father left. He was everything I had. When I saw that car parked in the driveway, and I heard a man’s voice coming from upstairs, I thought... I don't even know what I    thought. I... Whatever you do, you need to hang onto your daughters for as long as you can.         Orion: (Damn, I was scared as fuck, but now... poor woman. I don't even know what to say.)          Wyatt's mother: Please, I’d like you to leave now. And... I'm sorry. I can't believe I pointed a gun at someone. I-I shouldn’t have done that.                                                          Nancy: *Taking her hand* I can't even begin to imagine everything you've been through, but... I know what it's like to be a single mother. Everything you've had to struggle with. But if you’re like   me, you’d do it twice over just to see them happy. Wherever he is... I'm sure Wyatt is really proud of you.                                                                                             Wyatt's mother: You're... thanks. It’s been a long time since I’ve... Thank you, you’re a saint.    T-Thank you so much.                                                                                Nancy: We're going to leave now and stop bothering you, but I'm gonna give you my phone number.     *Chuckles* I know I'm just a stranger and this whole situation was not the best way to meet someone, but... if you ever need someone to talk to, please, call me. I can always lend an ear.             Wyatt's mother: *Crying* Thank you, dear. I will. And I'm sorry again about the...                  Nancy: Don't even mention it. We're the ones who should be apologizing. You did nothing wrong.      Orion: (Nancy really has a heart of gold. And a way with words. I wouldn't have been able to appease this woman with just a few sentences like she did. I'm glad this ended well.) . . . . . . . . .    ...is this your son, ma'am?                                                                         Wyatt's mother: Huh? Ah, yes. That's my Wyatt. We took that photo a couple of months before he      passed away.                                                                                        Orion: . . . What is he wearing...?                                                                 Wyatt's mother: Do you mean the reaper shirt? I think it was... from a rock band maybe? Or maybe    something from a movie? I know he loved that character, but I don't remember where it was from,     sorry.                                                                                              Orion: . . . And how tall was he? He looks huge.                                                    Wyatt's mother: Ah, yes, he was! Almost 6'9", if memory serves. He took after his father.           Orion: . . . And... I'm sorry, but... can I ask you one last question?                              Wyatt's mother: Of course.                                                                          Orion: How... How did he die?                                                                       Nancy: Orion! Come on, you're going too far.                                                        Wyatt's mother: Don't worry, it's okay. He... he suffered a sudden stroke. Doctors said it was due  to a congenital disease. However... even if it sounds strange, there's something that gave me some  peace of mind. *Sad chuckle* You see... Wyatt had a lot of hobbies.                                 ???: Can a man obtain the power of a god? Can a human transcend the limitations of mortality?       Wyatt's mother: He liked to play basketball.                                                        Thanatos: Do you know why Eternum is better than the other world, boy?                              Wyatt's mother: He loved rock music...                                                              Linus: Each NPC has a chip on their neck, similar to our neural implants, that dictates their       behavior.                                                                                           Wyatt's mother: He loved exercising too.                                                            Orion: Sometimes I feel like Eternum's NPC behavior is way too realistic...                         Wyatt's mother: But... By the whims of fate... Wyatt died while doing the thing he loved the most in this world...                                                                                      ???: Will you help us? Will you help us? Will you help us?                                          Wyatt's mother: ...playing Eternum.
