Annie: W-What? Are you... Are you serious? Benjamin... ...is d-dead?                                Orion: I swear! Mr. Keating told us in computer class. He said he had a stroke or some shit.        Annie: Damn... That's a bizarre coincidence...                                                      Orion: Coincidence?! That's bullshit!                                                               Annie: Bullshit...? What are you saying? Do you think Mr. Keating made all that up?                 Orion: Not Mr. Keating! Whoever made that information public... is trying to cover this whole thing up.                                                                                                 Annie: Are you... are you implying that he's dead because the Praetorians excommunicated him? Other people have been excommunicated before... and they didn't die.                                      Orion: Are you sure about that? Have you met any?                                                   Annie: Um... Well, no, but...                                                                       Orion: I'm telling you... there's something strange about this entire situation. But we shouldn't   talk about this here... We don't know who could be eavesdropping...                                 Annie: W-What? You think someone’s spying on us?!                                                   Orion: I have a feeling this shit is much bigger than we think, Annie. We witnessed the Praetorians killing Benjamin in Eternum, and somehow he's also dead in real life now. We know too much.         Annie: Y-You're starting to scare me! Eternum is just a game!                                       Orion: Just a game? I wouldn't be so sure about that... *Whispering* I just noticed... *Whispering* Do you know who that guy is?                                                                        Annie: W-What?                                                                                      Orion: *Whispering* He's been standing there ever since we sat down... *Whispering* I've never seen him before... *Whispering* I don't like this, Annie...                                              Annie: But... Isn't... Isn't that Chang?                                                            Orion: What?                                                                                        Chang: 'Sup, Orion! All good?                                                                       Orion: Oh... Hi Chang! Everything’s just peachy, yep! I'll text you later! Take care, buddy!        Annie: Aren't you being just a little too paranoid?                                                 Orion: Ok, maybe they're not spying on us... yet. But seriously, there's something fishy about      Benjamin's death.                                                                                   Annie: Do you seriously believe the Praetorians killed him in real life?                            Orion: Well... maybe not, but I'm sure it's all connected somehow.                                  Annie: I really believe you're overthinking this. Not everything has to become a conspiracy         thriller, you know?                                                                                 Orion: I don't know, Annie... him having a stroke? I'm not buying it.                               Annie: Well, what can we do? You know I love summoning my inner-Sherlock Holmes as much as you do,  but we can't go to Benjamin's house and just start interrogating his parents!                       Orion: Yeah, I guess it would be a little awkward if we did that...                                 Annie: We both know that Benjamin was not a good person, but it'd be disrespectful to his family... And we wouldn't get anything out of it anyway. I think the best thing we could do right now is put  all this behind us.                                                                                 Orion: *Sighs* Maybe you're right...                                                                Luna: Hi guys... Mind if I sit with you?                                                            Orion: Luna!                                                                                        Luna: I usually eat alone, but... then I saw you two here, and...                                   Orion: SEAT'S TAKEN! CAN'T SIT HERE!                                                                Luna: . . .                                                                                         Orion: . . . ...Sorry, bad Forrest Gump joke. Of course Luna, you’re always welcome with us!        Luna: Thanks!                                                                                       Annie: *Laughs* Don't mind him... Please, sit down!                                                 Luna: Thank you.                                                                                    Annie: It's so nice to meet you, Luna! I heard Orion managed to win a neural implant at your cafe!  Giving away a prize like that is so generous of you!                                                Luna: No worries. I already have my own, so I wouldn't have much use for another.                   Annie: You play Eternum too?!                                                                       Luna: Yes. Actually, Orion and I are gonna play together later tonight. We’ll be on a server called "The Red Herring". Do you wanna join us?                                                            Annie: Oh my god, yes! I'd love to! Can I play with you guys, Orion?! Please, please, please!       Orion: Wait... Did you say the server was called "The Red Herring", Luna? That’s a pretty           ominous-sounding name...                                                                            Luna: Yes. It's a mystery-themed server, with a hint of horror to it as well.                       Orion: Horror? Ok... maybe it'd be better if you didn't join us, Annie. You know how easily you get spooked.                                                                                            Annie: W-Whaaat? That's not true!                                                                   Orion: *Laughs* Come on, the last time we watched a horror movie, you couldn’t sleep alone for an   entire two weeks!                                                                                   Annie: But that's because I was a kid! I've grown up since then!                                    Orion: Oh yeah? Could’ve sworn that happened less than a month ago...                               Luna: To be fair, it's definitely more of a mystery server than a horror one. There’s tales of gory murders, gruesome kidnappings—all sorts of cold cases to crack. You roleplay as a detective and try to figure things out. I’ve been on a spree of success so far, but I recently ran into one case that I just can't seem to solve. Maybe with our three minds put together, we can unravel the mystery.    Annie: See?! It's just a fun-filled mystery server! We both love mysteries!                         Luna: It's not a very crowded server, so odds are we’ll be by ourselves most of the time.           Let Annie come with you                                                                             Orion: *Sighs* Ok, ok. I guess you can join us...                                                   Annie: Yay!                                                                                         Orion: But you're not allowed to complain if you’re scared, Annie!                                  Annie: Who, me? Scared? Never!                                                                      Orion: We'll see about that...                                                                      Don't let her come with you                                                                         Orion: I'm sorry Annie, we both know you can't handle horror... no matter how light it is.          Annie: What? Seriously?! You’re just going to ditch me like that?!                                  Orion: It’s in your best interest!                                                                  Annie: Bah! Fine. I'll go back to Ion!                                                              Orion: That's a better idea!                                                                        Luna: I'm sorry if I interrupted your conversation before.                                          Orion: Nah, no worries. We were talking about Benjamin. I was just about to head out, anyways...    Luna: Oh, yeah... Benjamin's death... That whole situation is really tragic...                      Annie: Orion actually thinks there's some sort of conspiracy behind it.                             Luna: Conspiracy? How so?                                                                           Orion: Well... Don't tell anyone, but... When we were playing yesterday, Annie and I saw Benjamin   get shot by a Praetorian. He was about to rape a girl, but then a Praetorian appeared and           excommunicated him. Between that and his death in real life... I think the timing of everything is  an odd coincidence, to say the least. I want to dig further into the cause of his death, but        wouldn’t even know where to start. So... yeah, I guess we're better off just forgetting about the   whole thing.                                                                                        Luna: Well, actually... If you really want to investigate... I might know someone who could help.   Orion: Oh really? Who?                                                                              Luna: It's someone I met at my Dad's cafe. Her name is Nova. She owes me a favor... or, at least,   that’s what she said last time we were together. I wasn't going to ask her for anything, but... if  you tell her I sent you, she might be able to lend a helping hand. If there’s anyone that could help in a situation like this, it’s her. She's an... "investigator". To be honest, I'm a little curious about it too. Something does feel a little off about Benjamin's death...                            Orion: Awesome! She sounds like just what we need. I feel like in this situation, every second      counts, but I don't wanna visit her today if that means we have to postpone playing together...     Luna: I think there's time for everything. Nova lives near me, so... you can just come over to my   place to play. Of course, that’s if you want to... To save the trip of having to go all the way back to your house... You’ll only need your neural implant — I have an extra visor and suit you can     borrow.                                                                                             Orion: That sounds perfect! Thanks Luna! I should get going then! I don't wanna be late.            Luna: Sure, I'll see you later. I'll text you my address. And Nova’s.                               Orion: Sounds good! Take care girls, I'll see you both in a couple of hours! (Oh shit, I got too    excited and forgot I still have a couple of classes left. Well, there’s only two hours left in the  school day. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt if I left early. I’ll just have to make up an excuse tomorrow and tell the teachers I felt sick or something.) *Looking at your phone* (Ah, there's Luna's message.  Hmm... Nova's house isn’t that far. I should be able to get there within the hour. I just have to   make sure I make it to Luna’s place by... What?! Raining again?! But... the sun was just shining 5  minutes ago... Well, the clouds don’t look that bad. Hopefully the rain will pass quickly.) WHAT    THE...!                                                                                             Axel: Grrr...                                                                                       Orion: What the fuck do you want now, Axel?!                                                        Axel: You... You motherfucker... YOU KILLED BENJAMIN!!                                              Orion: What?! What the hell are you talking about?!                                                 Axel: I saw you during computer class! You were nervous and sweating! You know something, don’t     you?!                                                                                               Orion: Are you out of your mind? I didn't kill Benjamin!                                            Axel: I know a fucking pussy like you could never do it, but you must’ve been involved somehow!     Orion: I told you! I don't know shit about that fucking bastard!                                    Axel: WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?                                                                        Orion: You heard me! Benjamin was an awful person. Am I supposed to speak well of him just because  he died? Forget that he was a jerk and a fucking rapist?! He deserves no respect. Not now and not   ever! That scumbag is better off dead.                                                              Axel: SHUT THE FUCK UP! YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIM!                                          Orion: I know enough.                                                                               Axel: You're so done!! I will ruin your life! And the lives of all the whores around you!           Orion: What?                                                                                        Axel: I saw you at the cafeteria... Hanging out with that nerd and the other freak. Probably        bragging about how well your plan to kill Benjamin went!                                            Punch him                                                                                           Axel: Aaaargh!                                                                                      Orion: MMMPGH..!                                                                                    Try to calm him down                                                                                Orion: Ok, that's enough. I had nothing to do with Benjamin's death and neither did the girls. Now  leave me alone!                                                                                     Axel: LIAR!!                                                                                        Professor Keating: Huh??! What in tarnation is going on here?! Axel! Orion! THAT'S ENOUGH!          Axel: You're dead! You hear me? DEAD!                                                               Orion: In case your simple brain didn’t hear me earlier, I said I don't know shit about Benjamin's  death. But I swear to God, if you ever insult Annie and Luna again, or lay even a finger on them... you’ll be reunited with Benjamin in no time!                                                        Professor Keating: Orion! I said that's enough!                                                     Axel: You'll regret the day you ever messed with a Bardot, you fucking cocksucker! Just wait... When you least expect it, I’ll be there to teach you your lesson. AND YOU! Take your hands off me,      beggar! Touch me again and my family will have you fired before you know it!                        Professor Keating: I-I'm sorry Axel, I d-didn't...                                                  Axel: Shut the fuck up.                                                                             Professor Keating: Ok, can you explain to me what the hell just happened? Getting into fights at    school already? You haven’t even made it through your first week! Seriously, Orion?                 Orion: He's the one who...                                                                          Professor Keating: I don't want to hear any excuses. I'll have to record this incident in your      permanent record. One more infraction and you'll be expelled. If that happens, you'll forfeit your  scholarship and have to return to the UK.                                                           Orion: What? Why am I being singled out here?! He's the one who threatened me!                      Professor Keating: I said that’s enough! Consider this your final warning.                          Orion: *Sighs* (Son of a bitch... Axel can threaten me all he wants... I'm not gonna back down.     Although... Perhaps I shouldn't have punched him. I don't wanna be expelled... Bah, fuck it. I'd do it again in a heartbeat.) *Sighs* (Anyway, I need to get out of here. Let's see if Luna's contact   can help me with this whole thing...) *Sneezes* (Hmm... More storm clouds rolled in... I guess the  rain won’t be leaving any time soon.) *Sneezes* (Brrr... This wind is freezing! This damn weather... Let's see if I can find this woman before I catch a cold... Her house should be somewhere around   here... 420 Maple Street. Oh wait, that's Luna's address. Hmm... 369 Rue Lorain Avenue. Rue Lorain? Oh, I'm already here! Lucky me. Alright, number 369. This should be the one. It feels weird ringing the doorbell like this, with me being a stranger and all. Oddly enough, Luna knew this woman's      address but not her phone number. Anyway, I guess that... Oh...)                                    ???: Whaaat? Rain again?! Why do I even bother listening to that stupid weatherman? Sunshine, my    ass... *Sighs* I'm so sick of this damn weather! I need to move to Nevada. With the constant rain   this place gets, I should probably trade my car in for a boat.                                      Orion: *Clears throat*                                                                              ???: Huh? Uh, hi there. Can I help you with something?                                              Orion: Hello! Um... Sorry to be so forward, but a friend gave me your address and I was wondering if you could help me with something.                                                                  ???: What? Me?                                                                                      Orion: Are you... Nova?                                                                             Sandra: Oh! No, I'm not. My name is Sandra. I'm Nova's mother.                                      Orion: Oh... I'm sorry ma'am.                                                                       Sandra: No problem at all! Are you one of Nova's friends from school?                               Orion: Um... Yes. (Nova's still in school? How is she supposed to help me investigate Benjamin's    death? I thought she'd be a police officer or a detective.)                                         Sandra: Did you come by for some help with your studies?                                            Orion: Erm... yeah, but if she's not home, I’ll get going. (Probably not a good idea to talk about  this stuff with her mother.) I'll come back another time.                                           Sandra: I was just leaving for work, but you can wait for her inside if you want. You shouldn't be  walking around in terrible weather like this.                                                       Orion: Thank you very much for the offer, but I can't stay long. I have a busy afternoon.           Sandra: Alright then, I'll let her know you stopped by. And sorry, your name is...?                 Orion: Orion! B-But you don't need to tell her! I'll just... text her later! No need to worry about it! It was a pleasure to meet you!                                                                  Sandra: Text her...? But she doesn't... Oh look who it is! Hey there honey!                         Orion: (Oh shit...)                                                                                 Sandra: Nova! Agh, look at you! You're all drenched! I thought I told you this morning to bring an  umbrella with you!                                                                                  Nova: I did! But I uhh... left it on the train.                                                     Sandra: Again?! I bet you got distracted, playing on your laptop as usual.                          Nova: Um... perhaps. But it doesn't matter, I can buy a new one.                                    Sandra: I’m not worried about the umbrella—I’m worried about you! Look at your clothes! You're gonna catch a cold!                                                                                      Nova: I’m not worried. My immune system is too strong for that. A little rain never killed anyone.  Sandra: Well, in any case, I want you to change out of those wet clothes and take a warm shower     immediately!                                                                                        Nova: Alright, alright...                                                                           Sandra: And where are your manners, young lady? Your friend Orion came all the way here just to see you! Say something to him!                                                                          Orion: Um...                                                                                        Nova: You... came to... see me?                                                                     Orion: Y-Yeah! (Oh god, this is awkward.) You were going to help me study for that upcoming quiz,   remember?                                                                                           Nova: Quiz...?                                                                                      Orion: Yes! We talked about it this morning at school! (Please, just go with it...)                 Nova: Ooooh... Orion! I remember now, of course! Sorry, my mind is a little fuzzy. Didn’t get much  sleep last night. Please, come on in! Make yourself comfortable!                                    Orion: What? Oh well, there's no need for that. We can uhh... study... out here...?                 Nova: Nonsense! I insist. You're leaving for work, right Mom?                                       Sandra: Yes, and I'm gonna miss my bus if I stay here another minute. Though, if it keeps raining   this hard, I might need a ride on Noah’s ark... Your father left a few minutes ago and I might have to work a little bit longer today... so take good care of the house while I'm gone!                 Nova: Sure thing, Mom!                                                                              Orion: Seriously, there's no need to...                                                             Nova: Nonsense, please, come in! We can study for the quiz after we've dried off and had some coffee and pastries! The mind functions better when the body isn’t hungry!                                Orion: Um... Ok, ok, if you insist...                                                               Nova: I do!                                                                                         Orion: Ahh... Well it is nice to finally get out of that rain. Sorry to put you on the spot back    there, Nova. Your mom started asking questions and I got nervous. *Laughs* I’m sure you’ve already  guessed I’m not here to study for a quiz.                                                           Nova: *Laughs* Yeah, I figured. You look a little young to be my college classmate... *Giggles* I’m surprised my mom didn’t notice.                                                                     Orion: Heh, sorry about that. (So she attends Kredon's college... Maybe she knows Penelope? Well, it doesn't really matter.) Alright then, I'll get straight to the point. It turns out that...         Nova: No, no! Please, take a seat on the couch! You’ll be much more comfortable.                    Orion: Don't worry, there's no need. I only need a couple minutes of your time. Someone told me that you...                                                                                             Nova: Seriously! Take a seat! And I’ll get you some coffee. What kind of hostess would I be if I    didn’t at least offer you something to drink?                                                       Orion: But...                                                                                       Nova: I won’t take no for an answer! Just give me a minute! I need to change out of these wet       clothes and then I’ll join you in the living room.                                                  Orion: Um... Well, ok.                                                                              Nova: No need to be shy! Get comfy!                                                                 Orion: (Wow, it's been a while since I’ve seen such hospitality. Nova seems very nice. And damn,    she's definitely cute, not gonna lie... This apartment is a little small, but I will say it’s       decorated very tastefully. Makes it feel pretty cozy. Hmm... There are a lot of books here. I wonder if...)                                                                                             Nova: Sugar—one teaspoon, or two?                                                                   Orion: Two! Thank you so—                                                                           Nova: DON'T YOU DARE MOVE A MUSCLE!                                                                 Orion: W-WHAT THE FUCK!!!                                                                           Nova: You thought you were sooooo sly, huh?!                                                        Orion: W-What?                                                                                      Nova: You thought you could come here and threaten my family just like that?                        Orion: WHAT?! What the fuck are you talking about?!                                                 Nova: Don't play dumb, Mr. "Orion". Given the choice, you could have at least chosen a better fake  identity. Orion?! What kind of stupid name is that?!                                                Orion: H-Hey! T-That's my real name! And w-what the hell is going on?!                              Nova: Assumed if I saw that you knew my family’s whereabouts, I'd chicken out right?! Well, joke's  on you. I'll kill you and then I'll flee the country with them!                                     Orion: What?! You must be confusing me with someone else! Put the knife down, please!               Nova: We can do this the easy way or the hard way. The easy way... you let me tie you up and then   you tell me who you work for. Or the hard way... I just kill you instead. Both ways are actually    pretty easy to me.                                                                                  Orion: Who I work for?!                                                                             Nova: It’s Ulysses, isn't it? I knew it. Those bastards...                                          Orion: But I don't work for anyone!                                                                 Nova: A mercenary, then? Bounty hunter, perhaps? How did you find me!! I had nothing to do with the South Korea DDoS attack!                                                                            Orion: I have no idea what you're talking about!                                                    Nova: How did you find where I live?!                                                               Orion: L-Luna! Luna told me!                                                                        Nova: Luna? Who's Luna? I don't know any Luna.                                                      Orion: You have to! She told me your address! Black hair, red eyes, pale skin... S-She likes...     murder stories and stuff! Oh my god... IS THAT HOW YOU KNOW EACH OTHER?! DO YOU TWO MURDER PEOPLE   TOGETHER?!! DID I GET LURED INTO BEING YOUR LATEST VICTIM??!!                                       Nova: Oh... Luna, the girl from Loco's Cafe?                                                        Orion: YES!! She told me you owed her a favor and you could help me investigate something!          Nova: Hmmm... I indeed owe her one... And she's the only person who knows what I do... and also my  true identity... How do you know Luna?                                                              Orion: We go to school together!                                                                    Nova: Hmm... Your story seems plausible... Unless this is a carefully crafted plan to gain my trust and then attack me from behind...                                                                   Orion: Do I look like a carefully-crafting assassin to you?! I don't even know who you are!         Nova: . . . Alright, you don't seem like you're lying! Sorry for all the commotion, I just had to   make sure!                                                                                          Orion: (Oh my god, I thought she was gonna slit my throat... This girl is fucking nuts... I don’t   care how cute I thought she was, I’m not trying to stick my dick in crazy!) Okay, are you gonna     explain to me what the fuck just happened?!                                                         Nova: Hey, better safe than sorry, as they say. I can’t take any chances. I didn't know who you     were, and then I found you talking with my mom, asking about me, making up a story about studying   for a quiz... I'm sure you can understand how it looked a little suspicious.                        Orion: Yeah, true. Maybe threatening me with a knife to my throat was just a tad excessive,         though...                                                                                           Nova: *Giggles* Yeah, alright, I’ll give you that. Sorry about it. Sometimes I can get a little     paranoid.                                                                                           Orion: Well, I must say, we both have that in common. Someone just told me I was paranoid earlier   today at school. You wouldn't believe what Mr. Keating told us during class. Do you remember him at all?                                                                                                Nova: I've never met a "Mr. Keating". I’m guessing you probably attend Kredon's Private High School.Orion: Oh... yeah, you're right. I forgot there are other schools in Kredon too.                    Nova: Yes, rich boys like yourself never pay much attention to the fact that not everyone has a     yacht and 3 Mercedes.                                                                               Orion: *Laughs* I wouldn't exactly say I'm rich. Really, if it weren't for the student exchange     program and its scholarship offering, I wouldn't have been able to come here.                       Nova: Oh well, I take back what I said, then. I know not everyone who attends that school is a rich moron, but there definitely are a good amount.                                                      Orion: Oh believe me, I’ve seen that firsthand...                                                   Nova: Anyway, back to the matter at hand... how can I help you?                                     Orion: Ah, yes. The thing is... There's something I wanted to investigate, and Luna mentioned you   could help me with that.                                                                            Nova: I see. That shouldn't be a problem. There's nothing in this world that my best friend and I   can't investigate. You've come to the right place! But after we’re done here, you'll have to tell   Luna we're even!                                                                                    Orion: Best friend huh? Are you and Luna the dynamic-detective-duo?                                 Nova: *Giggles* I'm talking about my trusty keyboarded friend here.                                 Orion: Your laptop? Does that mean that... Don't tell me you're a hacker!                           Nova: *Laughs* Ah, there it is. Another naive consumer misled by Hollywood productions and fantasies of the Internet. "Could you hack the NSA, Nova? Why don’t you just steal us some money from        Ulysses, Nova? Please erase all of my student loan debt Nova!!"                                     Orion: Could you do those things?                                                                   Nova: Um... W-Well, I don't know. P-Probably not.                                                   Orion: Aww... that's too bad.                                                                       Nova: But I can decrypt and access all sorts of databases and modify their contents without leaving behind a single trace—anything from classified documents to alterations in games like Eternum.      Orion: That's awesome!                                                                              Nova: Well, if you really want me to help you, you'll have to tell me all the details.              Orion: Of course. In fact, I'm glad you mentioned Eternum. It's related to that.                    Nova: If you're wondering whether I can find out where the Gems of Doom or the Weapons of Atlas are located, I'm sorry to tell you that I can't. Believe me, they would’ve been in my possession a long time ago if that were possible.                                                                     Orion: No, no, it's nothing like that. The thing is... Long story short—I saw someone being         excommunicated by the Praetorians yesterday, and then shortly after that... he was found dead. They said he had a stroke or something. I’m... not quite convinced this is all a mere coincidence.       Nova: Hmm... Maybe it's not a coincidence, but why do you think this is worth investigating? Perhaps the guy panicked when he found out he was banned and had a meltdown over that. Even healthy people can suffer a stroke.                                                                                Orion: I know, but... my gut is telling me that’s not the case.                                     Nova: You know, between you and me, I also believe Ulysses may be up to no good. If you’re skilled  enough to avoid getting caught, it's totally possible to modify some in-game features to tamper with the neural implant. But when I tried to access the company's classified directories, where all the juicy files would be, I was unable to break their encryption. They have one of the most             sophisticated Cybernetic Defense Systems I've ever seen. Though I could probably get in if I tried  harder... You know the... "Founder" that everyone talks about? There's no information about him     anywhere. There aren’t any records... not even a single sighting of him... Nothing. Anyway, as for  what you want me to look into... It shouldn't be a problem. I'll go through the local police records about the case. What's the guy's name?                                                             Orion: Benjamin Dawson.                                                                             Nova: Alright. Give me a couple of days. If there's something they're hiding about his death, or I  notice any discrepancies about his autopsy... I'll find out.                                        Orion: Awesome! You're amazing! Should we exchange numbers so we can keep in touch?                 Nova: Sorry, I don't have a phone.                                                                  Orion: Really? Why?                                                                                 Nova: Phones can be hacked. All your photos and private conversations could be leaked in less than a minute, if an expert hacker wanted to do so.                                                       Orion: Damn, no phone. That's... unusual.                                                           Nova: Yeah, well, I'm not your "usual" type of girl... I'm sorry to disappoint you. The entire      hacker lifestyle is dependent on anonymity. So if you're expecting me to be the typical girly-girl  who wants to go for ice cream and gush all about the latest reality TV shows, you can forget it. I  don't have time for any of those things.                                                            Orion: Why do you have an anime wallpaper, then? Ah, is that Jujutsu Kaisen?                        Nova: W-What? I mean, yeah... I might watch a couple of shows from time to time... I’m not a        cavewoman or something!  But... I don't have time for... Stop looking at my stuff!                  That character has his eyes covered too. Is that why you like it?                                   Nova: What? Of course not. It's not about that at all. I cover my eye because I have a condition... It's cool, I love anime too                                                                         Nova: It’s just a dumb thi— Huh? You... you like it too?                                            Orion: Hell yeah! I love it. I have a huge collection of anime, series, movies... I’m a huge fan! Do you play Eternum too?                                                                              Nova: Y-Yeah.                                                                                       Orion: Maybe we could play together sometime. I know you don't have a phone, but I could stop by    again soon.                                                                                         Nova: Like... to team up on a server?                                                               Orion: Yeah!                                                                                        Nova: I guess it could be... interesting. B-But well, maybe another day.                            Hey, what's that tattoo?                                                                            Nova: It's a cyber-owl.                                                                             Orion: *Laughs* A what?                                                                             Nova: It's a symbol! You wouldn't get it... *Clears throat* Anyway, you’ve made your request and    I’ve told you that I'll do it. Now get out of my house!                                             Orion: Copy that! I need to drop by my school again because I forgot my bag, so that's probably a   good idea anyways. Well, it was nice meeting you! See you in a couple of days! And if it’s not too  much to ask... please don't hack me. Unless it’s to add more commas into my bank account, then by   all means... fire away!                                                                             Nova: Hah! I won't hack you, don't worry.                                                           Orion: You sure? Promise me!                                                                        Nova: Yessss, I promise. I only hack people who I think are interesting. You're safe.               Orion: *Laughs* For once, I'm happy to be boring! Alright then, take care, Nova! Bye!               Nova: (That password was way too easy to crack. He doesn't even have two-factor authentication      enabled. Such a newbie, Orion. And... done! We're inside his phone. Let's see... Hmm... Nothing     suspicious. He seems to be clean. Good. He doesn't seem to be a bad guy, but I can’t afford to take any chances. Hmm... He doesn't have an Instagram account. Or a Facebook. That’s pretty rare         nowadays. Guess we're alike in that way. He does use YouTube a lot, though. And he has a couple of  interesting APKs installed. Oh, according to these GPS records, it looks like he arrived in the USA about a week ago. He got a scholarship to study in Kredon. He wasn’t lying after all... Mmm... His  photo gallery doesn’t have many photos... Let’s see here... that must be his house in Kredon, then  he’s kept a few screenshots from a game... Oh my god, he's almost naked in this one. He's... a lot  more ripped than I thought. Maybe I should stop snooping... I guess I've seen enough to make sure   he's not hiding anything...  . . .  Eh, what the hell! A little more snooping won’t hurt. It’s only to... make sure he's not a spy, of course... Seems to have a bunch of pictures with this            short-haired girl... Maybe his girlfriend...? Not that I care, of course... Although he has even    more photos with this Asian dude. A lot more. Maybe he’s gay? They could be lovers... Nah, I think  they're all just close friends. Well, I guess this is enough. I should start making dinner before   Dad gets home. But maybe I'll just take one last peek again at that photo of him in his boxers to... Uhh... make sure it’s not Photoshopped or anything... gonna have to inspect it reeeeeally          closely...)                                                                                         Luna: Coming!                                                                                       Orion: Hey Luna! Thank you for inviting me! I see you're all geared up and ready to go!             Luna: Yep! This is Eternum's E-suit.                                                                Orion: I know, they’re awesome! Annie and Dalia have one too. It looks so futuristic. Speaking of   which, is Annie here already?                                                                       Luna: No, she went to your house so she could use her own equipment. I only have one spare suit and visor. But she’ll be joining us as soon as we login to Eternum.                                     Orion: Ah, sounds good.                                                                             Luna: Did you speak with Nova?                                                                      Orion: Yeah! She said she’s willing to help investigate Benjamin's death. I know she probably won’t find anything weird or unusual, but at least I'll get some peace of mind. Thank you for lending me a hand, Luna. Might I ask why she owed you a favor?                                                  Luna: She used to come by our cafe to work on her laptop. One day she came running in and asked me  to quickly dispose of a bunch of flash drives and hard disks. I threw them away in the kitchen and a minute later, the police arrived and confiscated her laptop.                                       Orion: Hah! Then they couldn’t find anything on it?                                                 Luna: Exactly. That's when she told me she was some kind of hacker or computer wizard. She then gave me her address and told me to stop by if I ever needed anything.                                   Orion: Not everyone would’ve done what you did... risk themselves to help someone they barely       knew... that’s very kind of you.                                                                    Luna: I don't know, she... she didn't seem like a bad person. It just felt like the right thing to  do.                                                                                                 Orion: You're a genuinely good person, Luna.                                                        Luna: T-Thank you.                                                                                  Orion: Well, it's getting late... I think it’s about that time! Can't wait to jump back into        Eternum!                                                                                            Luna: Please, come in. Make yourself at home. Do you want anything to drink? Coffee, perhaps?       Orion: (Man, last time I was invited inside and offered coffee, the situation escalated quickly...) *Shudders* N-No, don’t worry about me... I'm good. But thank you! You have a really beautiful home, Luna! Everything looks so spotless!                                                                 Luna: Thank you. I tidied up the mess before you got here. You can sit on the couch, if you want.   I'll bring you the visor in a second.                                                               Orion: Sure! But before I sit down... Do you mind if I use the bathroom?                            Luna: Um... Y-Yes, but there's something I need to tell you first. Can you sit down?                Orion: Yeah, but I really have to use the restroom first. I've been holding it ever since I left    Nova’s house...                                                                                     Luna: Um... O-Okay, you can go to the bathroom. It’s just down the corridor... But don't look into  the room on the right. My father's corpse is still there.                                           Orion: *Chuckles* Yeah, of course. *Chuckles* Nice try Luna, but I'm already getting used to your   twisted little "jokes"... What the fuck...                                                          Luna: The voices never stopped talking...                                                           Orion: *Turning around* W-What?                                                                     Luna: I tried to shut them up, but I couldn't. I found myself drowning in their cries. I tried to   resist them... but I failed... B-By the time I came to my senses, it was already too late. I found  myself stabbing him... ripping into his flesh. One stab, after another, and another... The blood was gushing everywhere... *Crying* I... I did this, Orion... I'm a m-monster. I am insane.             Orion: *Hyperventilating* Y-You did t-this...? How... Why...                                        Luna: I must be locked up... I can’t control the voices... the urges... no... You must help me... We need... We need to get rid of the body before it’s too late. We have to cut it into pieces... flush it down...                                                                                         Orion: *Hyperventilating* W-What the fuck are you t-talking about Luna...                           Mr. Hernandez: It's okay, Orion. This is not the end. Death is not the scariest fate. The denial of it... could be far worse.                                                                           Orion: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!      AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!                                                                               Mr. Hernandez: HAHAHAHA!                                                                            Orion: WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!                                                                     Mr. Hernandez: *Laughs* Oh god, that was hilarious!                                                 Luna: I'm sorry, I told my dad you were coming and he insisted on playing a trick on you.           Orion: I... *gulps* I don’t think I have to use the bathroom anymore...                             Mr. Hernandez: *Laughs*                                                                             Luna: He has a prop knife and a gallon of fake blood, and he loves to use them. Believe it or not,  it's not the first time he's done this to someone.                                                  Orion: Well I guess I see where you get it from, Luna... like father, like daughter...              Luna: Yeah, I couldn't help but play along with him.                                                Mr. Hernandez: Sorry Orion, don't hold it against me.                                               Orion: *Laughs* I won't, sir. I have to admit that you did get me pretty good. Once my heart rate   goes back to normal and I remove these bricks from my underwear, I'll have to shake your hand for   that one...                                                                                         Mr. Hernandez: Ah, I'm glad to see you've got a good sense of humor! You've earned the right to stay at my house!                                                                                       Orion: Thanks!                                                                                      Mr. Hernandez: Well, I have to go back to the cafe. I'll be back for dinner. Play nice!             Luna: Sure thing, Dad.                                                                              Mr. Hernandez: Oh, I should probably change out of these clothes first. A lot of police frequent the cafe and I don’t think they’d enjoy my new attire very much... Now take care, Orion.               Orion: Goodbye, Mr. Hernandez! Have a good day at work!                                             Mr. Hernandez: Thank you.                                                                           Luna: Well, with that show out of the way... I guess it's time to start playing. Sorry about my dad. He can be pretty wild sometimes...                                                                 Orion: *Laughs* Nah, I think it's cool! I wish my father would’ve done fun things like that when I  was living with him. But yeah, you're right, let's play!                                            Luna: Alright, go ahead and use the bathroom... if you still can... and then meet me in the living  room.                                                                                               Orion: *Chuckles* Sounds good to me!                                                                Luna: Ok, I'll log in first and then send you an invite. Annie should be waiting for us already.    Orion: Perfect! Is there anything I need to know before joining this server?                        Luna: Nothing in particular. I'll explain everything once we're there.                              Orion: Alright then, let's not waste any more time! How long should I wait for your invitation?     Luna: . . .                                                                                         Orion: (Oh, I guess she can't hear me anymore. Pretty crazy how much the game takes over all of your senses. I heard the neural implant comes with a safety system that wakes you up if it detects a    physical problem, like any sort of bodily harm or trauma. It’ll even detect issues with your        surrounding environment too, like the fumes of gas or even the presence of smoke. I wonder if that  system has ever failed... Well, that should be enough time for her to send the invite. It's my turn to jump in!)                                                                                        You activate the neural implant. Connected. Welcome back to Eternum. You've received an invitation  from... Luna. Would you like to join her session?                                                   Orion: Let's do it!                                                                                 Please prepare to connect...                                                                        Orion: (Ok, I'm... I'm standing! I can feel my legs! And I'm not even dizzy! Nice! I’m getting used to Eternum after all! Hmm... Seems like a nice, family-friendly neighborhood... not ominous looking whatsoever...) *Shivering* (Jeez, it's cold in here.)                                               Luna: Orion!                                                                                        Orion: Luna! Wow, I love your outfit! It gives me sorceress vibes. You look beautiful!              Luna: Thank you. I won it in a tournament.                                                          Orion: Really? Another tournament? Man, first you won the neural implant, now a cool outfit...      *Laughs* Something tells me it's better not to mess with you in Eternum!                            Luna: *Giggles* I'm not that good. Actually, my destruction magic is rather weak. But I'm not a bad summoner.                                                                                           Orion: Summoner?                                                                                    Luna: I can... invoke different creatures. Animals, soldiers, ghosts... But I can show you that     another day. I doubt we'll have to deal with any kind of combat on this server. Do you like your    outfit, by the way?                                                                                 Orion: My outfit? Oh, DAMN! I didn’t even notice! Finally, I don't look like a noob! My             peasant-looking days are behind me! Is this your doing?                                             Luna: Yeah, I sent it along with your invitation. I thought a classic detective outfit suited the   server.                                                                                             Orion: Love it!                                                                                     Annie: Ughh, why is it so cold here?! Couldn’t you have picked a server in the tropics or           something??                                                                                         Orion: Annie!                                                                                       Annie: Hi there!                                                                                    Orion: Glad you could make it!                                                                      Annie: Of course! I never miss an opportunity to play Eternum!                                      Orion: *Laughs* Yeah, I know that firsthand.                                                        Luna: Welcome, Annie.                                                                               Annie: Thank you so much for inviting me, Luna!                                                     Luna: My pleasure!                                                                                  Orion: I love your outfit, Annie! You look beautiful too.                                           Annie: Oh... B-Beautiful? Well, t-thank you. I just chose the first thing I saw in my inventory...  It's nothing special... I just thought that since we were going to a server of... Of... What exactly is this server about again, Luna? I know you told us earlier... It definitely looks very eerie...  Luna: Well, I welcome you to "The Red Herring", a server dedicated to solving mysteries and         uncovering the truth behind the horror.                                                             Orion: Truth behind the horror, huh?                                                                Luna: Yeah. This server consists of 12 different cities and towns, each with multiple districts     within. Every district has dozens of cases waiting to be solved.                                    Orion: Man, and this is all on one server? Sometimes I forget just how big Eternum is... Is there a case to be solved around this area?                                                                 Luna: Yes. "The Enigma of the Foggy District". As I mentioned before, this is the case that’s got me stumped. I've tried repeatedly to solve it by myself, just as I did with all the others, but I’m   still stuck.                                                                                        Orion: Ah, no worries Luna, we'll solve it together! They don't call me Orion Holmes for nothing!   Annie: *Laughs* No one calls you that!                                                              Orion: And how should we start? I don't see anyone at all...                                        Annie: Actually, now that you mention it, yeah... you're right. There's not a soul around. No       NPCs... players... nobody. Hmm, well what’s the story behind this place, Luna?                      Luna: There once was a man named Jeremy Flink, a rich and powerful businessman, who opened a cement factory here. He took advantage of the fact that this was a poor neighborhood and hired hundreds of workers for far less than minimum wage. All while he lived an extravagant life in the comforts of a modern, luxurious house outside the slums. After experiencing years of abuse under his watch, the   workers got fed up and burned the factory down. The ashes of that fire blanketed the streets like   snow, and ever since that great fire, the sun has not risen once...                                 Orion: Hmmm... The sun has yet to rise, huh... maybe there could be something paranormal going on   here too... Is that possible?                                                                       Luna: Some of the mysteries in The Red Herring just involve simple murders or robberies with        perfectly reasonable explanations, but there are others that do dive into the paranormal realm,     yes.                                                                                                Annie: Oh god, I don't like the sound of that...                                                    Luna: With the factory destroyed, most people ended up leaving the neighborhood, and now there's    only a handful left. That makes investigation of this case slow and very difficult. All the other   players who have tried to solve it before have given up already, so we probably won't see anyone    else. On the other hand, the more difficult the case, the better the bounty. If we managed somehow  to unravel this mystery, the reward will definitely be worth it.                                    Orion: Interesting...                                                                               Luna: So... yeah, I think our best bet would be trying to find some villagers. I've already spoke   with most of them numerous times, but maybe you'll have better luck at catching something I         haven’t.                                                                                            Annie: Hmm... I wonder what’s causing the fog and the endless night. Could it be a curse? Maybe we  have to find its source?                                                                            Luna: I've already been to the old factory grounds, but there's nothing but a mountain of ash and   iron debris now.                                                                                    Orion: (Luna's not wearing her gloves... No burns, scars, birthmarks, tentacle hands, or penis      fingers... Why does she always wear gloves, then? If it’s because she likes the look of gloves, why wouldn't she wear them inside Eternum too? Should I ask again? No, it's probably not the right time for that... Man, that dress fits her body perfectly... And it complements her breasts so much. They seem to be way bigger than I thought... She's very pretty and has a great body. Maybe if her        personality was a little different, she'd be super popular at school. I hope she doesn't change one bit, though. I love how she is. If she was any different... she wouldn’t be, well, Luna.) *Clears   throat* Um... W-We should... Oh, look! There's a man over there! (God, that was embarrassing. Did   she catch me staring at her tits?) L-Let's go talk to him!                                          Annie: Oh, you're right! Someone’s sitting on the ground!                                           Luna: That's Enzo! That's Enzo!                                                                     Orion: Do you know him?                                                                             Luna: Yes, he used to be a factory worker, but was one of the few that stayed behind when everyone  left. He's got... nowhere to go.                                                                    Annie: Aww... that's so sad... Poor man.                                                            Orion: Poor guy. Hello... Enzo?                                                                     Enzo: . . . What do you want?                                                                       Orion: I'm Orion. Can we talk for a bit?                                                            Enzo: No. Go away.                                                                                  Orion: Okay...                                                                                      Luna: *Sitting on the floor* Hello Enzo.                                                            Enzo: . . . Miss Hernandez?                                                                         Luna: Yours truly! And I told you to call me Luna, Enzo. How have you been?                         Enzo: Same as always. Staying out in the cold and always getting sick.                              Orion: He remembers you...                                                                          Luna: *Whispering* Of course. The memory of NPCs is never reset. Sometimes it becomes impossible to distinguish them from a real player roleplaying. *Whispering* The Founder is a genius.              Annie: Is there anything we can do to help you, Enzo?                                               Enzo: You can't do anything. Everything is already lost. It all went to shit when they burned that  damn factory down. I told them not to do it, but they didn't listen...                              Luna: Do you know why the sun never rises here? What could be causing it?                           Enzo: I don't know... Everyone in this district either died or abandoned the city. Only I remain,   left alone to live amongst the rats and cockroaches...                                              Orion: Did they kill the factory owner? Mr. Flink? Maybe he's the one who’s left a curse on this    place.                                                                                              Luna: As far as I know, no. He was on a business trip outside the city when everything happened… and to top it all off, his insurance covered everything. He didn’t bat an eye at the destruction that  took place here.                                                                                    Annie: Do you know of anyone who would curse this place, Enzo?                                      Enzo: We did something terrible... We deserve it...                                                 Annie: What did you do?                                                                             Enzo: We did something terrible... We deserve it...                                                 Luna: It's not your fault, Enzo. Mr. Flink was an exploitative, evil man.                           Enzo: We did something terrible... We deserve it...                                                 Luna: *Standing up* And that's it. Once he starts saying that, he enters a never-ending dialogue    loop.                                                                                               Orion: Hmmm... Well, that didn’t help us much. We don't know what's causing the curse, if there is  one, and have no idea how we could even lift it.                                                    Luna: Yes, I know. It's frustrating. This is why everyone stopped trying to solve this case. There  are a couple more villagers, but they all end up repeating the same thing. "We did something        terrible. We deserve it."                                                                           Orion: Hmm... Do you know where they are? Maybe if we...                                            Mysterious woman: It's almost midnight.                                                             Orion: Huh? Who's that woman?                                                                       Luna: I... I don't know. I've never seen her before...                                              Annie: Why does she look so scary...                                                                Orion: Excuse me? Ma'am? Did you say... midnight? How can you tell what time it is? It's always     night here.                                                                                         Mysterious woman: The child will wake up at midnight. You have to help her.                         Orion: The child?                                                                                   Mysterious woman: That little girl is the key to lifting this curse. Help her, and you'll remove the curse that consumes this place.                                                                    Orion: Where's the girl?                                                                            Mysterious woman: On the highest floor of the Bixen Building. In the only room with light.          Orion: Yes... I see it.                                                                             Mysterious woman: If you delay too long, the light will fade away, and with it, the hope of ever    lifting this curse...                                                                               Orion: Who are you? Why are you helping us?                                                         Mysterious woman: I'm just a member of the Syndicate like any other.                                Orion: The Syndicate? From the factory that burned down?                                            Mysterious woman: . . . Good luck, Orion.                                                           Orion: Well that was strange...                                                                     Annie: W-Was she an NPC?                                                                            Orion: I guess...                                                                                   Luna: I'd never seen that NPC. Well, I guess she wasn't a player.                                   Orion: I guess not... Well, in any case, we got lucky. We have a new clue. Let’s head over to       that... Bixen Building... Hm, the main door was left open...                                        Luna: Weird, I thought I had already explored this building during my previous visits to the Foggy  District.                                                                                           Orion: Well, let's take a look anyway.                                                              Annie: Aaahh that’s more like it... It's so warm and cozy in here...                                Luna: Yeah, you're right, it feels so good.                                                         Annie: This fireplace is like heaven. My hands were freezing out there! Is this server always so    cold and damp?                                                                                      Luna: Not at all! I once solved a case in an iron foundry, where the heat was so bad I had to strip down to my underwear.                                                                               Orion: (Oh come on now!! Why couldn’t we solve a mystery over there?!)                              Luna: You know, I've definitely been here before. I'm sure of it. But last time the building was    empty, the lights were out, and the fire wasn't lit...                                              Orion: Hmm... Maybe they only switch the lights on at a certain time of the day?                    Luna: Hmm... Could be. It's so warm and cozy in here...                                             Orion: Yeah, you're right, it feels so good. It’s freezing out there! Is this server always so cold and damp?                                                                                           Luna: Not at all! I once solved a case in an iron foundry, where the heat was so bad I had to strip down to my underwear.                                                                               Orion: (Oh now come on!! Why couldn’t we solve a mystery over there?!)                              Luna: You know, I've definitely been here before. I'm sure of it.                                   Orion: Really?                                                                                      Luna: Yeah, but last time the building was empty, the lights were out, and the fire wasn't lit...   Orion: Hmm... Maybe they only switch the lights on at a certain time of the day?                    Luna: Hmm... Could be.                                                                              Orion: Wait a second... Do you hear that?                                                           Luna: What?                                                                                         Orion: . . . That noise... It's coming from upstairs... There's someone here.                       Luna: Perhaps it’s the child that woman mentioned?                                                  Orion: Probably, but I get the feeling that we're not just gonna find a normal kid who wants to see if you have any games on your phone...                                                              Annie: W-What do you mean by that?                                                                  Orion: I have no idea what to expect, so get ready for anything. Maybe we’ll find a deformed kid, or perhaps the kid's already dead and we're hearing the murderer chopping their body into pieces.     Annie: W-What?! Y-You're scaring me, Orion.                                                         Orion: Well, in any case, we have to get up there. We can’t give up... we have to solve this case!  Luna: Yes!                                                                                          Annie: Y-You guys go first... I’ll be right behind you...                                           Luna: I think that's the window we saw from the street.                                             Orion: Yes, I think so. Let's take a look. Oh shit, the lights went out...                          Luna: The only light left is coming from that candle...                                             Orion: *Whispering* Oh man, you have got to be kidding me...                                        Annie: *Whispering* Oh m-my g-god...                                                                Luna: *Whispering* There's that little girl... The woman was telling the truth... *Whispering* We   have to talk to her.                                                                                Orion: *Whispering* A-Are you sure about that?                                                      Luna: *Whispering* She must be the key to lift the curse and solve this mystery. There’s no way this is just a coincidence.                                                                             Orion: Um... Hello? Dear?                                                                           Kid: . . .                                                                                          Orion: *Whispering* Holy fuck, this is so creepy... *Whispering* Why isn't she answering?           Luna: *Whispering* Maybe she's scared.                                                              Annie: *Whispering* C-Can’t be m-more scared than I am r-right n-now...                             Orion: Hello? Are you lost? We can help you. We won't harm you...                                   Luna: *Whispering* Why are you talking with that voice?                                             Orion: *Whispering* W-What voice?                                                                   Annie: *Whispering* Yeah, you sound like someone trying to lure a kid into your windowless van...   Orion: *Whispering* T-This is my normal voice! A perfectly pleasant, normal voice! How else am I    supposed to sound?!                                                                                 Kid: Who are you?                                                                                   Orion: *Whispering* Oh, shit, she answered!                                                         Annie: *Whispering* Say something!                                                                  Orion: *Whispering* But what?!                                                                      Luna: Can we come and sit next to you?                                                              Kid: . . . Yes.                                                                                     Luna: Thank you. I'm Luna. It’s really nice to meet you. What’s your name...?                       Kid: . . . Where are Mommy and Daddy?                                                               Luna: If you tell us your name, we can help you find them.                                          Kid: . . .                                                                                          Annie: I'm Annie.                                                                                   Annie: Oh come on, you have got to be kidding me...                                                 Orion: (Thank god my Annie didn't come, this would have freaked her out.)                           Luna: Nice to meet you, Annie. That's a beautiful name.                                             Annie: Mommy calls me Anne, though.                                                                 Luna: We can call you whatever you want! Anne is a beautiful name too!                              Annie: I want my toys. I have nothing to play with here. Daddy said he'd bring me my toys.          Annie: W-What do you wanna play with?                                                               Annie: I want Mr. Nebula.                                                                           Luna: Mr. Nebula?                                                                                   Annie: My favorite teddy bear. I left him at our house. Now I have nothing to play with here.       Luna: We can go get him, if you want. Where's your house?                                           Annie: . . .                                                                                        Luna: How about we go on an adventure together? An adventure to get you a new toy! Is that all      right?                                                                                              Annie: . . . Ok. But please don’t leave me.                                                         Luna: Don't worry, we won't. Orion will go get you a new toy! Annie and I will stay here with you.  Did you know she has the same name as you? Only pretty girls can be named Annie!                    Annie: Y-Yeah, we'll stay here and play with you... A-Annie.                                        Luna: I'll stay here with you.                                                                      Annie: . . . Ok.                                                                                    Orion: A new toy? Where could I find one?                                                           Luna: There's a man who sells all kinds of stuff in this district. He's not always around, but maybe we'll get lucky. He seems to frequent the area that’s about two blocks down, past the old          schoolhouse. If he's not there, come back and we'll think of something else.                        Orion: Alright, count on me! I'm your man. I'll go get you the best toy you've ever had, Anne! Just wait for me here.                                                                                   Annie: . . .                                                                                        Orion: (I need to hurry. This whole situation is creepy as fuck... I don't wanna leave Luna here    alone for too long. I need to hurry. This whole situation is creepy as fuck... I don't wanna leave  the girls here alone for too long. Hmm... That looks like a trading post. It must be the merchant   Luna mentioned. Lucky us! Hmmm... doesn’t look like there’s going to be much of a toy selection for the girl, though. Let’s see... cabbages, some live animals, a camera, and... is that an assault     rifle? What a bunch of random junk.) *Laughs* (Kind of reminds me of...)                            Chop-Chop: OOOOHHHHHHHHHHH!                                                                         Orion: This has got to be a joke...                                                                 Chop-Chop: WELL HELLO, FRIEND! WELCOME BACK TO CHOP CHOP’S!!! Best shop in ALLLLL RED HERRING! No,  no, IN ALL ETERNUM!                                                                                 Orion: Chop-Chop?! What the hell are you doing here?!                                               Chop-Chop: Why, selling goods... make big MONEY of course! CHA-CHING, KACHOWWWW!!!! You know        already! Only best materials! Best products!                                                        Orion: But didn't you have a shop in Ion?                                                           Chop-Chop: Ion no give enough moolah! Too many peasant-dressed players, too many tiny wallets!! I   need work in more places, have to pay for son's college! He's gonna become a great businessman like his father and make me rich! I mean, make me proud!! HOOHYEAHHH?! If there's a corner in Eternum    without a shop, Chop-Chop will be there! Monies, monies! Pretty pennies!                            Orion: *Laughs* I pity your son. Well, as much as I’d love to contribute to your son’s college fund, I don't think you can help me this time. I was looking for children's toys and it doesn’t seem like your selection meets the criteria...                                                               Chop-Chop: OOOOH! YOU LUCKY LUCKY BOY!

Um... alright fine, only because you seem to be my only hope out   here. Show me what you have.                                                                        Chop-Chop: First: Pickaxe of Destiny!                                                               Orion: WHAT?! NO! You already scammed me with that rusty shovel the first time! You already tried to scam me with that rusty shovel the first time! No more useless tools "of Destiny"! And a pickaxe is not something for a child to play with! *Sighs* I was looking for a teddy bear or something like   that. If you don't have any, I'll just get going.                                                   Chop-Chop: Ahhhh! Should have said sooner! I have teddy bears!                                      Orion: Really?                                                                                      Chop-Chop: Yes, yes, most cuddly bears in all Eternum! MUCH FLUFFY!!! Give me second! They round    here somewhere... Ah! Here they are! Just little longer... I'm choosing best bear!                  Orion: . . .                                                                                        Chop-Chop: Ah, yes! This one PERFECT! Here you go, friend! Best toy in ALL Eternum!                 Orion: Um... Did you just make this now with an old cushion?                                        Chop-Chop: You see cushion? Kid see new best friend!!                                               Orion: It smells kinda weird...                                                                     Chop-Chop: That the smell of love and invaluable companionship!                                     Orion: (Well, to be honest, it doesn't look that bad for something that was made in 30 seconds. I   hope it's good enough.) Alright, I'll take it. How much is it? Don't try to con me!                 Chop-Chop: Oh come now?? Can’t ever put price on childhood friendship!! ...But in this case, I will. Only 30 eternals! Good friend discount, just for you!!                                             Orion: (I expected worse, to be honest.) Ok, deal.                                                  Chop-Chop: Excellent, excellent! You won’t regret! You just solidified child’s value of loving      relationships for rest of their lives! How sweet... AH AH D’AWWWWWW!!! You won't regret it! Anything else you need?                                                                                     Orion: No, that was all, thank you.                                                                 Chop-Chop: New shoes? Ring for ding-dong? Gift for lady? Tasty snack for tummy-tums?                Orion: (Hmmm... Actually... I got the neural implant thanks to Luna, I think it’d be a nice gesture to get her something as a thank you. Annie loved the pendant I bought her at Chop-Chop's... maybe he has something similar.) You said you have something for a lady?                                    Chop-Chop: Of course! What does she like? How is she?                                               Orion: Um... Well, her name is Luna, she has red eyes and black hair. She's a summoner, I think,    and...                                                                                              Chop-Chop: AHHH! SHUSH SHUSH! SAY NO MORE! I HAVE PERFECT GIFT!                                     Orion: But I just said that...                                                                      Chop-Chop: Come with me! This Maurice.                                                              Orion: . . . . Erm... The goat?                                                                     Chop-Chop: Yes, yes! Best goat! He comes from far-off land! Say hi, Maurice!                        Maurice: *Bleats*                                                                                   Chop-Chop: Girls with red eyes love animals!                                                        Orion: Do they?                                                                                     Chop-Chop: What gift is better than receiving new best friend?! Maurice can do everything! Thirsty? He make you glass of milk. Lonely? He good company! Have valuables? Fear not, he guard home! Tired  of cleaning up after him? He turn into many meals and delicious broth!                              Maurice: *Bleats*                                                                                   Orion: Um... Do you have anything else?

Chop-Chop: This Maurice.                                                                            Orion: I... thought the goat was named Maur—                                                        Chop-Chop: Maurice very intelligent! He know all the answers! See for yourself! Maurice, what's the capital of Sweden?

(Hopefully, the teddy bear will be enough to break the curse or whatever is going  on in this town. I hope the girls have been ok up there...) I'm back! You guys been... having       fun...?                                                                                             Annie: Y-Yeah, sure. Anne and I have been talking and we're almost friends already, right? We've had so much to discuss, and she was just about to remember how she got here.                           Annie: . . .

I’m    proud of you!

Orion: (Hopefully, the teddy bear will be enough to break the curse or whatever is going on in this town. I hope she's been ok up there...) I'm back!

Luna: Nice! Did you hear that, Anne? Orion brought you a toy! Just for you!                         Annie: . . . This is not Mr. Nebula.                                                                Orion: Y-Yeah, I know, but he's a new friend! He’s been so eager to meet you! He told me he wanted  to play with you so bad!

Annie: ...Yes. I wanna see my mommy.                                                                Orion: Of course! We want to get you back to your mom! Do you know where she is?                    Annie: I... don't remember.                                                                         Orion: (Well, at least she's talking a bit now.) How about your house? Do you remember where you    live?                                                                                               Annie: ...No.                                                                                       Orion: Hmm... What's your mother's name?                                                            Annie: . . . ...Alicia Flink.                                                                       Luna: *Gasps* Of course...                                                                          Orion: Huh?                                                                                         Luna: *Whispering* Anne Flink! She's the daughter of the factory owner!                             Orion: Oh! The rich guy!                                                                            Luna: Yes! *Whispering* I heard Mr. Flink left the country after his factory was destroyed...       *Whispering* Maybe... He and his wife left their daughter here? And now we're supposed to help her? Orion: *Whispering* Really? What kind of parents would do such a thing?                             Luna: *Whispering* Well, Mr. Flink was not known to be a good person... *Whispering* Maybe... if we show the little girl a picture of her mother, the curse will be lifted and we'll solve the mystery  of the Foggy District! *Whispering* I once participated in a case on this server that was solved in a similar way. *Whispering* The curse of the River Severn was lifted when I showed the tormented    woman, who relentlessly unleashed her anger by drowning innocent fishermen, a picture of her        long-lost daughter.                                                                                 Orion: Hmmm... Alright, it's worth a try.                                                           Luna: One of us has to go to her house and grab a picture of her mother. There must be one there.   Go yourself                                                                                         Orion: I'll go.                                                                                     Luna: You? Are you sure? It could be... dangerous. Or... really scary.                              Orion: Oh, now I definitely am going. I can't let you have all the fun! *Chuckles* What?            Luna: Nothing. I thought I was the only one who enjoys this kind of stuff. I've been playing Eternum alone for so long that I forgot I could team up with other people too. It... feels nice. Thank     you.                                                                                                Orion: Anytime, Luna. I’m really enjoying getting to play with you, too. This definitely won't be   the last time we solve a scary mystery together! Right, Annie?!                                     Annie: Y-Yeah, it's s-soooo much fun! T-Team Ghost H-Hunters...!! Y-Yaaay...                        Orion: *Chuckles* Don't worry, I won't take long. Where's the Flink house?                          Luna: It's on the edge of the district... about a 10-minute walk. I think it’ll be pretty easy to   recognize because, unlike the rest of the slum, it’s particularly modern and sleek.                 Orion: Alright then, I'll be on my way. The only things worth fearing are outside Eternum!          Luna: Good luck!                                                                                    Ask Luna to go                                                                                      Orion: I think you should go. You're the most experienced in all this scary stuff anyway.           Luna: Alright, I can do it. Anne, I'm going to visit your house for a little bit. Stay here with    Orion and Annie, ok? Anne, I'm going to visit your house for a little bit. Stay here with Orion,    ok?                                                                                                 Annie: . . . ...Ok.                                                                                 Luna: I'll be right back. Stay here, it shouldn't take long.                                        Orion: No worries, we won’t move a muscle. Right, Annie?                                            Annie: Y-Yeah sure, I’m not planning on going anywhere...                                           Orion: Good luck, Luna. Good luck, Luna.                                                            Luna: Thanks.                                                                                       Orion: *Yawns* Luna sure is taking a long time... Do you think she's okay? Maybe I should go find   her.                                                                                                Annie: And leave me here all alone?! No way!                                                        Orion: (Maybe I should go find her. But I can't leave Anne by herself...) Hmm? A-Anne? Is there     something wrong?                                                                                    Annie: . . . *Starts running*                                                                       Orion: What the... Hey! Wait! Come back! Fuck, we have to follow her!                               Annie: I'm r-right behind you!                                                                      Orion: (Fuck, I have to follow her!) *Panting* F-Fuck, how can those little legs move so fast?!     W-Wait, is that... Luna! Have you seen Anne?!                                                       Luna: Yeah... She was reunited with her mother.                                                     Orion: Her mother?                                                                                  Luna: Yes. She was the source of the curse on this place. They both died tragically in their house, after the angry mob set it ablaze.                                                                  Orion: What? A fire? Wait... Anne... was dead? But how...                                           Luna: It's a long story. I found... things... inside the house. There was some kind of riddle... but you probably don't wanna know the details. I know I'm the only one interested in these macabre     stories. Don't worry, I'm used to it... Anyways, look. The girl gave me this mysterious  box and    then vanished, but she left an exit portal behind.                                                  Orion: A portal! Thank god, we can leave... (Fuck, there aren’t any street lamps around... Thank god the house has a lamp, otherwise it would’ve been impossible to find this place. Damn, this house   definitely looks luxurious. It must be the one... It looks nothing like the other buildings around  here. Is that a... flashlight on that swing? Hm... I don't think that's just a coincidence. I might be a noob in Eternum, but I've played enough video games to know that I should take it. Seems to    work just fine. If Mr. Flink and his wife supposedly left town months ago, the house isn’t going to have any power. I should probably conserve these flashlight batteries, though. Well alright then,   time to get this over with. Here's the plan: I’m just gonna go inside, grab a picture of Ms. Flink, bring it to the girl, and lift the curse of the abandoned child. Then Luna will shower me with hugs and Annie will gush non-stop about how I'm the bravest man she's ever met. Here's the plan: I’m just gonna go inside, grab a picture of Ms. Flink, bring it to the girl, and lift the curse of the      abandoned child. Then Luna will shower me with hugs and gush non-stop about how I'm the bravest man she's ever met. Yeah. Sounds like a solid plan to me. Let's do it! The main door was unlocked... And wow, this place looks spotless. I thought for sure it would’ve been pillaged already. I mean... I  don't know how far the "immersion" goes in these kinds of servers. Maybe the village NPCs aren’t    programmed to visit this place. Or maybe...) *Gulps* (O-Ok... Calm down Orion, it's just a game...  L-Luna said it herself, this is only a mystery-solving server... Nothing can really harm me here... ...Right? Well at least I have this flashlight... F-Fuck this shit, man... Why can't I be hanging   around the servers full of hot girls wearing bikinis? Or why can’t I solve the mystery of who wins  the wet t-shirt contest?! O-Okay, I need to stay calm. There are no ogres, zombies, or any weird    stuff on this server. It's j-just a simple mystery server... You need to find that damn photo,      Orion. Where do people keep photos of themselves... T-The bedroom? Or maybe the living room... This fucking house is creeping me out... Oh, come on... Please, not now... This fucking flashlight... did Chop-Chop sell them this shitty thing?! Please, don't fail me now... Oh, thank god. The dining     room... Everything looks so stylish. You can definitely tell they were business people. Hmm... You  can also go into the garden from here. It seems to connect the living room and the main bedroom. No pictures of Ms. Flink here, though. In fact, there are no pictures of anyone. Just these... weird   paintings everywhere. This house might be fancy, but it feels so... cold... lifeless. Poor Anne. I  guess she didn't have a happy childhood. And her parents abandoning her was just the icing on the   cake. I wonder if... W-What the fuck... Is t-there... someone in this house? I need to get out of   here... fast...) *Sighs* (...hmm? Is that a phone ringing? Where is that coming from? Ok... The     logs... Hmm... There are a lot of them. I better count them right... There are a lot of them. I     better count them right... Even the garden is still in pristine condition... If these people left   months ago, who’s been cleaning the house all this time? And what's the deal with all the damn deer everywhere? Statues, figures, paintings... The whole house is full of them... They look creepy as   fuck... Well here’s the phone... Am I s-supposed to pick it up? I guess so... F-Fuck, I should have asked Luna to come here instead of me... Snap out of it, Orion! The sooner this is over, the sooner I can go back to the comfort of my home.) H-Hello?                                                  Madison: Alicia?! It's me, Madison! Are you there?!                                                 Orion: W-What? I'm not...                                                                           Alicia Flink: Madison? What's going on? I heard a big explosion!                                    Orion: Who...                                                                                       Madison: The factory! They blew it up! It’s all gone, Alicia!!!                                     Orion: (Am I... Am I listening to a conversation between Anne's mother and another woman?)          Alicia Flink: What?! Oh my god, my husband warned me this would happen...                           Madison: I think they're heading to your house next, Alicia! You have to get out of there!          Alicia Flink: What?! What do they want?                                                             Madison: They want to burn it down too! You need to run away! I'm on the bridge, in my car. Hurry   up!                                                                                                 Alicia Flink: W-What? Oh... FUCK! I... Ok, ok, I'm on my way! But I need to hide something first!   Madison: What? What for?!                                                                           Alicia Flink: Remember the safe I showed you last Friday? Behind the bedroom? It’s a fireproof safe. I have to save the family photo album, Madison! Anne's whole life is in there! I can't lose it all! You know how much it means to me!                                                                  Madison: And where's Anne?!                                                                         Alicia Flink: She's at her grandparents' house! We can get her after I meet up with you! Just let me save the photos!                                                                                   Madison: Ugh... Fuck! Ok, but please move as fast as you can! The workers are getting close, and    they're blinded by hatred for your husband! They’re consumed with rage! I d-don't know what they'll do if they see you there...                                                                         Alicia Flink: O-OK! Thank you! Don't worry, I'll be right there!                                    Madison: PLEASE HURRY!!!!                                                                           Orion: . . . (Well, in the end, they didn't burn the house down... But maybe the family photo album is still in there... I should check it out. No family photos anywhere... This room is empty. It     almost looks as if...) *Breathing heavily* (I need to find that thing and leave this place          already... Anne's dinosaurs... He mentioned they were dirty... maybe they’re in the washing machine? Or maybe... Oh... they're right here. I swear these toys weren't here earlier... I g-guess I'm just nervous and I'm overlooking things. Anyway... Two dinosaurs. Two dinosaurs... The bedroom... with  no sign of any pictures. Just these damn paintings...) *Sighs* (...Hmm? Is that a phone ringing?    Where is that coming from?) *Breathing rapidly* (W-What the fuck was that... My eyes must be playing tricks on me... Keep it together, Orion! This is just a fucking Sherlock Holmes server, for god’s  sake... There's no one here... N-Nothing can harm you... T-T-There's no one here... O-Oh yeah... the candles, yeah... Three candles... Three candles... There it is! The safe Alicia mentioned on the   phone! The pictures I'm looking for must be inside. Aw fuck, of course, the door is closed. Well,   maybe it’s... Nope, just as I thought... It's fucking locked. Goddammit...) *Sighs* (Well, what's in this little notebook?)                                                                              I can't believe you keep forgetting the combination!  Let's try to use a mnemonic device this time!  There are only three sets of numbers. The first number is the number of aromatic candles we keep  in the bathroom. The second number is how many dinosaurs Anne is always playing with (which are in  the laundry room, btw, because they got all dirty and sticky). And finally, the third number is the number of logs we have in the garden (yeah, the ones we cut two winters ago and haven't used yet).  Maybe with this trick, you can finally remember it! And if not... You can always come to me and ask. I love you, Alicia. -Jeremy.                                                                       Orion: (Hmmm... I guess this was written by Mr. Flink. Looks like they had a good relationship.     Well, in any case, I can use these clues to open the safe! I remember seeing some of those things.  Come on Orion, we're just about done! You’re on the home stretch!)                                  Read the notebook                                                                                   The first number is the number of aromatic candles we keep in the bathroom. The second number is how many dinosaurs Anne is always playing with (which are in the laundry room, btw, because they got   all dirty and sticky). And finally, the third number is the number of logs we have in the garden    (yeah, the ones we cut two winters ago and haven't used yet). Open the safe                         Orion: (Ok...) YES! (Fuck, that’s not right...)                                                     Go back                                                                                             Orion: (Ok... What do we have here... An old camera, a newspaper... And pictures! Here they are! Oh thank the heavens! Yes! This little girl looks like Anne. And the woman carrying her must be her    mother, Alicia. Finally, we solved the case! Now I'll just bring this picture to Anne and then the  curse will be lifted once and for all! Time to get the fuck out of this creepy house. There are a   few other things in the safe, but I don't think I’ll need them. Hmm... this newspaper... It’s from  the day after the burning of Flink's factory...) FLINK’S IN FLAMES! Two deaths and 46 reported      injuries in a factory fire started yesterday at 4:30 pm in the Foggy District. Witnesses claim the  fire was intentionally set by a group of workers at odds with local businessman and factory owner,  Jeremy Flink. After burning the Flink factory down, the perpetrators then went to the residence of  the Flink family to destroy it as further revenge. They started another fire that burned the house  to the ground. (Hmm? Burned the house to the ground? But I thought this was their house...) Alicia  Flink, wife of the magnate, panicked after discovering their daughter Anne, only 7 years old, was   still inside the house after the fire started. (...What?) Breaking through the security barrier, she frantically hurried back into the building to save her only child. Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of firefighters on site... ...Both Alicia and Anne Flink were burned alive and left charred to death in their own home, on that fateful night. *Breathing rapidly* (What... T-The mother...     S-She died in this house... A-And she's... She's still here... Fuck, I have to get to the front     door... But of course this fucking flashlight isn’t working again and now I can't see shit... What  am I gonna... Wait, the camera from the safe! I can use the camera flash to help me navigate out of here!) *Grabbing the camera* (I hope this thing still works... O-Ok... I can do this... L-Let's     go...) *Breathing heavily* (I'll c-cross the garden. It's the fastest way... W-What?! Why is the    door to the garden closed?! Fuck, I can't open it! Think, Orion, THINK!! Ummm... I remember you     c-could access the garden from the bathroom too. F-Fuck... W-What the fuck is that thing...         S-S-She's in the garden... I can't go that way... A-Almost there, almost there... O-O-Oh s-shit...  Noooo... N-Not that way... Oh my f-fucking god... T-The living room... I'm n-nearly there... Come   on... Y-Yes! The main door! I'm out of here! No... No, no, no... You have to be kidding me... This  isn't happening... Why is the door locked...) *Sitting on the floor against the door* O-Ok... (I    have to come up with a plan... T-This is just a game, Orion... They wouldn't have created this just for you to suffer and die... ...R-Right? F-Fuck...) E-Erm... A-A-Alicia? I... I can help you! I know what they did to you and your daughter was horrible, but I can reunite you with her again!         P-Please, listen t-to me! I know where she’s at! We found her! She's in the slums! If y-you don't   kill me I can bring her to you again! Please! J-Just give me 10 minutes! I'll bring her here!       T-Trust me! PLEASE! (O-Oh shit... S-She left...? Oh thank god, she left... Now I have to...)        Alicia Flink: *Raggedly breathing*                                                                  Use the camera                                                                                      Orion: AAAAAAAAAAAARGH! FUCK! FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!! W-W-What... L-Luna? Luna! *Standing up* Oh my god, it's so good to see you! I've never been so happy to see someone!                              Luna: What happened?                                                                                Orion: T-The mother of the little girl! S-She was killed in the house, burned to death by the       villagers! And she was... s-still there or... maybe it was her spirit or something, and her body was covered in burns, and...                                                                           Annie: W-What do you mean she was still there?? L-Like a zombie?                                    Orion: Yeah!                                                                                        Annie: W-What?!                                                                                     Orion: I found a safe inside the house, and... I got the photo! We have to bring it to... Wait,     where's the little girl?                                                                            Luna: She suddenly got up and started running in this direction. We tried following her, but lost   track of her shortly before we arrived here. I tried following her, but lost track of her shortly   before I arrived here.                                                                              Orion: Oh, fuck! Now we're never gonna find her!                                                    Annie: Mister.                                                                                      Orion: What the... Anne... I found your mother! I... I have a picture of her! I... also found out   what happened to you and your mom. T-That was so horrible. I can’t begin to tell you how sorry I am. Your life... was just beginning... and to have it stolen from you, I just... ...Is this box for me? Ok... *Picking up the box* T-Thank you...                                                          Annie: *Starts running*                                                                             Orion: Hey! Wait! Come with us! You have to... Oh my god...                                         Annie: W-W-What is that?!?!!                                                                        Luna: Who's that...                                                                                 Orion: Mrs. Flink.                                                                                  Annie: W-What?!                                                                                     Orion: She was the source of the curse on this place. They both died in their house, separated only by the fire set by the angry mob... The only thing they yearned for... ...was just to be together   again. They were innocent victims caught in a war they wanted no part of.                           Luna: That's so tragic...                                                                           Orion: Sometimes I feel like Eternum's NPC behavior is way too realistic...                         Luna: Do you think they’re able to develop real feelings? Like what we see in the movies?           Orion: I sincerely hope not... A portal! Thank god, we can leave... Does this mean we’ve solved the case, Luna?                                                                                         Luna: Yes. The Foggy District will now return to normal and a new mystery will soon surface, after  some time has passed.                                                                               Orion: So... this must be our reward for completing this quest.                                     Luna: I guess so.                                                                                   Orion: I wonder what's inside...                                                                    Luna: Only one way to find out.                                                                     Orion: Yep.                                                                                         Luna: ...Orion? What is it?                                                                         Orion: T-This is... No... this can’t be real... Is this...                                          Luna: A Gem of Doom...?                                                                             Annie: You can't be serious. This has to be some sort of mistake...                                 Luna: It's impossible...                                                                            Orion: But it looks exactly like the Gems that Idriel showed me when I first joined Eternum... And  then I saw another one when Dalia and I met Thanatos, and it looked just like this too! Could it be real?                                                                                               Luna: I... I don't know. I've never seen one up close before. We should keep it for now… maybe we   can find someone who can examine it and tell us whether it’s real or not. You should hold onto it,  Orion.                                                                                              Orion: What?! Why me? You're a much higher level than I am!                                         Luna: I know, but the fact that you’re a newbie means you're less likely to be mugged. No one       expects to gain much from looting a low-level player. It’s not worth the effort.                    Orion: But... It’s so much responsibility... What about you, Annie?                                 Annie: No way, I can't take it... I barely did anything in this mission. And I doubt it's a real Gem of Doom anyway... Although... Real or not, it looks so pretty. I can't take my eyes off it.        Orion: *Sighs* Okay, I guess I'll keep it in my inventory for now. The next time we log in, we can  try to find someone who can examine it and tell us what it really is. I feel like we've had enough  excitement here for today.                                                                          Annie: Yeah, I’m pretty spent...                                                                    Orion: Let's go back to the real world! DAMN! Holy shit Luna, that was intense!                     Luna: Yeah, to be honest, that was way more intense than I was anticipating. Sorry about that.      Orion: Nah, don't apologize! Not gonna lie, that quest scared the shit out of me, but I had a blast the entire time! This is gonna be the second time today I’ll have to remove these bricks from my    underwear!                                                                                          Luna: I'm glad! Well, not about the bricks. I’m happy you had fun! I'm gonna go get changed into    something more comfortable, I'll be right back. Your clothes are right there on the table, by the   way.                                                                                                Orion: Alright, I'll get changed too. Thanks for lending me the suit and the visor! (Wow, it's      already nine... And I haven't even had dinner yet. It's crazy how quickly time passes when you're   playing Eternum. I'm gonna need a few minutes to remember everything I needed to do before I started playing. Now I can understand why a few people have gone crazy by playing this game. They say when people start confusing the real world with Eternum, there's no turning back... Man, I hope that     never happens to me. Good thing I have stuff to do this weekend and I won't be playing too much.)   Luna: Done.                                                                                         Orion: Nice! (She's wearing her gloves again...) It feels a little weird to be back. I get so       immersed in the game that I feel a little out of place after I log off.                             Luna: Yes, that happens to me too.                                                                  Orion: I get a strange sense that I'm gonna open that door and find a horrible monster, ghost, or   merchant selling some weird... Oh shit, Maurice!                                                    Luna: Hmm? Maurice?                                                                                 Orion: Well... Uhm... I bought you a present when I went looking for a toy to get Anne Flink, but I left it in the house where we first found her. It was... ...a goat. ...a toucan. ...a cat. It sounds a little stupid now that I’ve said it out loud.                                                    Luna: You bought me a pet? For Eternum?                                                             Orion: Yeah... I guess people know that I'm a rookie and they take advantage of me. I'm sorry, I... Luna: I love it! Thank you!                                                                         Orion: R-Really?                                                                                    Luna: Yes! In Eternum, an animal can passively increase the magic abilities of a summoner. I was    actually trying to get one myself!                                                                  Orion: (I can't believe Chop-Chop was actually telling the truth for once. Guess I need to thank    that goofy bastard after all...)                                                                    Luna: And besides... No one's ever given me a gift before... other than my father. Thank you Orion, it means a lot.                                                                                     Orion: But now we lost it...                                                                        Luna: Not at all, I'll go back to the server tomorrow morning and look for... Maurice, you said?    Orion: *Laughs* Yeah, that's his name.                                                              Luna: Don't worry, things don't disappear without reason in Eternum.                                Orion: Glad to hear that, then! I get a strange sense that I'm gonna open that door and find a      horrible monster, ghost, or merchant selling some weird stuff...                                    Luna: *Laughs* I can imagine.                                                                       Orion: Well, I guess I should be going now.                                                         Luna: Sure... will I see you Monday?                                                                Orion: Of course!                                                                                   Ask her about the gloves                                                                            Orion: (You know... I think we trust each other well enough. I really like Luna, and I'd like to    learn more about her...)                                                                            Don't ask her                                                                                       Orion: (It's probably better just to let it be. I don’t want to come off as pushy.) Take care, Luna!Luna: Bye!                                                                                          Orion: Um... You don't have to answer this if you're uncomfortable about it, but... Why the gloves? Luna: Oh... Uhh... I...                                                                             Orion: Y-You know what, forget I asked. I'm sorry, Luna.                                            Luna: It's just that... yeah, I am a bit uncomfortable talking about this. Maybe some other day.    Orion: No worries, I understand. (It's probably better just to let it be. I don’t want to come off  as pushy. Maybe she doesn't trust me because I sent her to that damn house instead of going         myself... I fucked up.) Take care, Luna!                                                            Luna: Bye... No, it's okay, don't worry.                                                            Orion: I'm just curious because I thought maybe you’d be hiding a birthmark or something, as I know some people are self-conscious about that kind of stuff... but you weren't wearing any gloves inside Eternum. And I know it's a rather weird compliment to give to someone, but you have beautiful      hands.                                                                                              Luna: T-Thanks...                                                                                   Orion: Hey, I completely understand you don't want to talk about this, Luna. Forget I even mentioned it! *Laughs* Hey, you probably just enjoy wearing gloves and I'm here searching for a reason that  doesn't even exist!                                                                                 Luna: It's not that... It’s just... When I was in middle school, I told a friend about this and     she... freaked out. She stopped talking to me and then all the other kids started to call me a freak because of her. I haven't had any real friends since then.                                         Orion: I'm sorry to hear that, Luna... Kids can be crueler than adults sometimes. But don't worry,  no matter what you say, I'll always be there for you. We're friends now, alright??                  Luna: I started wearing gloves ever since that incident and I never take them off.                  Orion: Seriously Luna, you don't have to explain yourself.                                          Luna: *Takes her gloves off*                                                                        Orion: (Just like in Eternum, she has fair, gentle-looking hands. I'm so used to seeing her with    gloves that she seems so vulnerable without them.)                                                  Luna: I haven’t told this to anyone ever since that incident. Promise me that you won't think I'm   crazy.                                                                                              Orion: What? I could never think that of you!                                                       Luna: Ok, and if you were to believe me... promise me that you won't freak out either.              Orion: No matter what you say to me, or even choose not to say to me... You're truly a wonderful    person, and I'm so glad to have you in my life. Nothing will ever change that.                      Luna: . . . When I... When I touch someone with my bare hands... I can see their future.            Orion: Their... future? Like what will happen to them tomorrow?                                     Luna: It could be the next hour, day, week, or even month. I can't really know until I touch them.  Orion: (Wow... I wasn't expecting that. I was thinking maybe she had really clammy hands or         something.) And what kind of things can you see?                                                    Luna: It could be anything, if it's close enough in time. I saw my teacher being fired, my          classmate's dog having an accident, my neighbor moving to another state, and... I s-saw my mother   dying.                                                                                              Orion: Oh my god... That must have been such a horrible thing for you to witness...                 Luna: That was the first thing I saw. I was only 5. Soon after that, she was diagnosed with a heart disease, and... She died 3 months later.                                                            Orion: I'm so sorry, Luna...                                                                        Luna: It's okay. It happened a long time ago. When I was 7, I decided to start wearing gloves all   the time, to avoid accidents. I don't need to wear them in Eternum because it doesn't work there.   Orion: No one else knows about your power?                                                          Luna: No one. Not even my father. I thought it'd be better to keep it to myself.                    Orion: It really means a lot that you decided to trust me, Luna. I know it’s not an easy thing to   do. So, what you’re saying is... If you touched me with your bare hands right now, you would be able to see my future?                                                                                  Luna: Y-Yeah, but that's a bad idea.                                                                Orion: Why? I'm both perplexed and fascinated. I wanna know my future!                              Luna: But... what if I see something bad?                                                           Orion: Eh, I'm sure it won't be anything that bad! Maybe you’ll just see me ripping my pants at     school, or something. And hey, you might be able to see something that could help us with the       mystery of Benjamin's death! Or maybe something that allows me to prevent a tragedy.                Luna: But... . . . Are you sure about this, Orion?                                                  Orion: 100% sure. I want you to be the real you, Luna. I don’t want you to hold back part of        yourself when you’re with me.                                                                       Luna: ...okay. R-Raise your hand with your palm facing down.                                        Orion: Like this?                                                                                   Luna: Yes. . . . If I do this, there's no turning back.                                             Orion: I know. Whatever you see, our relationship won't change. I promise.                          Luna: . . .                                                                                         Orion: (Hmm... I don't feel anything. Just her warm hand holding mine.) Luna?                       Luna: Oh my god...                                                                                  Orion: Is it t-that bad?                                                                            Luna: No... that’s impossible...                                                                    Orion: What did you see?                                                                            Luna: Nothing.                                                                                      Orion: Huh? Nothing?                                                                                Luna: Nothing! I'm touching you and I can’t see anything!                                           Orion: Is that... a good thing?                                                                     Luna: It's wonderful! Look at this! I can finally touch someone with my bare hands, without having  any kind of visions or feelings of dizziness!                                                       Orion: Did you... lose your power somehow, then?                                                    Luna: No. I still have it. I can feel it. It's just... you. I can touch your hands, your chest, your face... And I see nothing! It's like touching a table or... a coffee mug!                          Orion: *Laughs* I guess I'll take that as a compliment.                                             Luna: It's amazing...                                                                               Orion: (Man, I can feel her body pressing against mine. And her face is so close... I can feel her  warm breath against me... She's even prettier up close. Why did she stop talking? I can't stop      gazing into her eyes... they’re so... Should we... Should I...)                                     Luna: *Clears throat* S-Sorry, I got carried away. It's just that... I wasn't expecting this at all.Orion: N-Nothing wrong with that!                                                                   Luna: Well... I, umm, guess I should start preparing dinner. My dad will be here soon. I'm glad you convinced me to try this. I'm happy to have someone with whom I can finally share everything.       Orion: And I'm so happy I’m lucky enough to be that person, Luna. Whatever you need, I'll always be there for you.                                                                                      Luna: Thank you.                                                                                    Orion: Will I see you Monday, then?                                                                 Luna: Of course. We can meet at lunchtime... if you want.                                           Orion: I'd love that. Take care, Luna. Have a nice weekend!                                         Luna: You too. Take care... Orion.                                                                  Orion: (Ah... Tomorrow's Saturday at last. I hope I can get a restful night's sleep. I have to train with Dalia and join Nancy's yoga class in the morning. At least both things are in the same gym. I gotta join Nancy's yoga class tomorrow morning. I gotta go to the gym with Dalia tomorrow morning.) *Sneezes* (Fuck, this room sure is cold... and this terrible weather isn't helping. Ahh... This will help. Feeling warmer already. Hmmm... Looks like Penny hasn't uploaded anything today. Maybe she's waiting for Sunday. I'm sure we can take a few good photos for her. And it seems that Luna isn't on any sort of social media. The thing with her hands left me pretty intrigued. I usually don't believe in that kind of stuff, but... I don't know, she seemed sincere. We should find out more about her  ability. I want to help her feel normal again. Meh, nothing interesting on the news.) *Yawns* (Well, time to hit the sack. I hope I don't have much trouble falling asleep...)                          Annie: *Brushing her teeth* *Brushing her teeth* *Brushing her teeth* (It's impossible... That Gem  of Doom can't be real. There are only 10 of them in the world. It has to be fake... right? We have  to bring it to an expert. Or I could ask Idriel the next time I visit the Main Nexus. Well, who     cares. It's gonna be a fake, for sure. Probably a knock-off... a “Gem of Boom”. But... what if it's not... We'd be the owners of a Gem of Doom! Like Thanatos! That server sure was scary, though... I  hope we don't have to go back there ever again. And the worst part is that I couldn't show my powers to Orion... I barely did anything, actually. He must think I'm a useless, scared kid... Luna seems quite strong... She told me she can summon a level 20 banshee... And Dalia can carry a sacred great sword... in one hand! And meanwhile... Little Annie can't do anything but cower at the sight of     anything even remotely scary or dangerous. Yeah, nice job impressing Orion in Eternum, Annie.       Well... to be fair, it didn't scare me that much. I mean, sure... I was scared in the server, but   all fear was erased shortly afterward! After I... uhh... got back to the real world... agh. But who wouldn't have been scared?! There was a freaking zombie!) *Spitting the water* *Spitting the water* Aaaaaaaah... (That's right! I'm not scared at all right now! I gotta give myself some credit for    that. The old Annie would be in her room right now, hiding under the blankets and trembling with    fear. Well, not anymore!) *Giggles* (I still remember when I watched The Ring a couple of years ago and I couldn't sleep for days. It took me a while, but I finally understood that the scary things in video games and movies stay there. There are no ghosts or zombies in the real world. Anyways, I    should get some sleep. S-Since when has this hallway looked so scary? Why is it so dark? It seems   way darker than usual! I shouldn't have been the last one to go to bed... Oh, please! That was the  old, scared Annie coming out there for a second! New Annie is not afraid of a little dark corridor! Let's just go to my room, come on.) . . . . . .                                                     Orion: Hmm...? (Did someone knock on the door?) Uhh... yes?                                         . . .                                                                                               Orion: (I’m probably just imagining things...) Annie? Is something wrong?                           Annie: Oh, Orion! I wasn’t sure if you were asleep already! Nothing's wrong! I’m fine... It's just  that... Well, you know, I was heading to my room, and... I...                                       Orion: Let me guess. You're scared shitless after that horror server and now you're seeing ghosts   and monsters everywhere.                                                                            Annie: Erm... P-Perhaps.                                                                            Orion: I told you! You shouldn't have played in Luna's server, Annie! You can't handle that scary   stuff! Remember when we played Dead Space?                                                          Annie: I know, b-but I didn't want you—I mean, I didn’t want Luna to think I'm a scaredy-cat! I...  You're right, I'll go back to my room. S-Sorry to bother you.                                       Orion: . . .                                                                                        Let her sleep in your room                                                                          Orion: *Chuckles* Oh, Annie. Never change, alright? Do you wanna sleep here tonight?                Send her to her room                                                                                Orion: Annie... If you don't face your fears, you'll never get over them. Come on, go back to sleep. Ghosts don't exist!                                                                                Annie: Y-You're right, I guess. I'll go back to my room. Ghosts don't exist. Ghosts don't exist...  Orion: Do you want me to go with you?                                                               Annie: No! It's ok. I'm an adult. I can handle myself. Ghosts... don't... exist...                  Orion: Alright then! Remember, only Dalia, Penny, Nancy, and I are inside this house. No one else.  No ghosts, ok?                                                                                      Annie: Mm-hm...                                                                                     Orion: Good night! (I kind of feel bad, but it's the only way she can overcome her fears. I did the right thing.) *Yawns* (Well, back to sleep. Big day tomorrow...)                                    Annie: R-Really? Can I?                                                                             Orion: Of course. In the end, I only want you to feel safe. So how can I say no?                    Annie: T-Thank you! It’ll only be tonight, I promise!                                               Orion: You can sleep here as many times as you want. You don’t even have to ask, alright? But       tomorrow you’re getting tasked with some eye bleach therapy. You need to spend all day watching     videos of cute kittens on YouTube! I don't like seeing you scared.                                  Annie: I will! Thank you!                                                                           Orion: Anytime, Annie.                                                                              Annie: Thanks! D-Don't tell the people in the Ion Server that I got scared playing Eternum, though. Some of the girls there think I'm a badass. It would destroy my reputation.                         Orion: *Laughs* I won't say a word, I promise.                                                      Annie: Hey, your room is so cozy! And you have a nice view of the backyard!                         Orion: It is pretty nice!                                                                           Annie: My room faces the front yard. It’s a nice view too, but sometimes you can hear all the cars  passing by. Well, time to sleep, I guess... Luckily your bed is big enough for the both of us. You  could probably even fit three or four people on here!                                               Orion: Yeah, it is. I gotta thank Nancy for that.                                                   Annie: For sure... She's been super nice so far. We gotta prepare something to thank her one of     these days.                                                                                         Orion: Agreed. I'll think of something.                                                             Annie: G-Goodnight, Orion.                                                                          Orion: Goodnight Annie. (Mmm... It smells so good... Smells like strawberries... Hmm... Since when  did my room start to smell so good? Mmmm? Oh yeah... I forgot that Annie came to sleep in my room.  She... S-Shit, why are we in this position?! Fuck, she's holding onto my arm. I can't move it       without waking her up... She's probably used to hugging a pillow while she sleeps, or something.    Well, she's gonna move eventually, I guess. I hope she doesn't wake up before doing so, though.     We're in quite an... intimate position... I don't want her to think I'm trying to take advantage of her while she sleeps. I can feel her boob on my arm... It feels so...)                              Annie: Hmmm...                                                                                      Orion: (I fucking hate Kredon's weather...                                                          Annie: Mmm? Oh my god, why are we in this position?! Oh shit, I'm grabbing his arm! He must be      thinking I'm trying something... This is so embarrassing!)                                          Orion: Um... A-Are you awake, Annie?                                                                Annie: Y-Yeah! S-Sorry!                                                                             Orion: Sorry for what? I'm the one who should be sorry! I... Uhm... I swear I wasn't trying         anything.                                                                                           Annie: I know! I was the one who grabbed your arm... I'm used to hugging Baloo whenever I doze off, so...                                                                                               Orion: Baloo?                                                                                       Annie: Oh... Well... It's a stuffed bear that my mother gave me when I was 5, and... Well, you know, I got so used to sleeping with it, and... (Oh my god, why did I say that?! Now I probably sound    like a child to him...)                                                                             Orion: Oh... I didn't know about Baloo.                                                             Annie: W-Well, I just like to hug something while I sleep... so it makes it hard when I don’t have  anything... I guess I could use a... p-pillow or... I don't know... (I'm stupid. Of course Orion    would never want to be with me.) Um... I guess it'll be better if I sleep in my own bed now. I'm not scared anymore, so... Thank you. I'll see you around. N-Night. *Leaves*                            Orion: (Damn, that came out of the blue.) *Sighs* (I guess I fucked it up, just like always. Anyway, I'll talk to her tomorrow.) *Yawns* (I can't do much more now. Back to sleep. Big day tomorrow...  Annie: He probably just sees me as the little girl who still plays with stuffed animals... the tiny little thing who’s barely tall enough to ride a rollercoaster. I can't blame him. He probably       prefers real women... taller ones, over 5'5 at least, with a big butt and a nice rack. I'll always  just be Annie, the "best friend".)                                                                  Orion: I think that's so cute! You can hold onto my arm if you want! I don't mind! (Oh god, look at how embarrassed she is. She's probably thinking that I'm a filthy pervert. I'm a fucking mess. She  needs someone more mature. This is why I'll always just be Orion, the "best friend"...)             Annie: Well, you woke up before I did, so I was probably making you uncomfortable.                  Orion: Nonsense! I could never feel uncomfortable around you. It was just... uhh... your shirt.     Yeah, it feels a little itchy against my skin. That’s it. Just the shirt, not you at all.           Annie: My shirt is bothering you...?                                                                Orion: Um... Y-Yeah. Just itchy, y’know. (Jesus Christ, I need to come up with some better excuses. This one was even worse than when Dalia caught me in the bathtub.)                                  Annie: Well, if my shirt is bothering you... I... umm... I can take it off... o-only i-if you want  me to.                                                                                              Orion: . . . *Gulps* Uhh... (Did I hear her correctly?) W-What?                                     Annie: My... my shirt. If it’s making you itchy, I can just take it off... If it makes both of us   feel more comfortable... then I don’t really mind... I'm not s-shy... It’s just a shirt after all,  right..?                                                                                            Orion: (I'm not sure where she’s going with all of this... But I sure as hell want to find out...)  Oh, o-okay... I mean, yeah, as long as you don't mind... I think that would definitely help us both to... sleep... better...                                                                            Annie: Yeah, that’s umm... what I was thinking, too...                                              Orion: (Oh my god, is she really gonna do it? This doesn't seem like the Annie I’ve known since I   was young... Is she trying to prove something?                                                      Annie: Oh man, what am I doing?! I... I can’t... ...No. You’re a woman now, Annie. It’s time to     prove it to yourself... and prove it to Orion.)                                                     Orion: (Holy shit, I’ve never seen her in such an... intimate way... Well, apart from the time I    used Chop-Chop's glasses in Eternum, but I probably shouldn't mention that right now... My god... I can’t keep my eyes off of her... This is really Annie... my Annie. The fact that she’s willing to be so vulnerable with me... I swear to god, I won’t let anything ever happen to her. If Axel, or      anyone else, touches her again... I'm gonna kill them.)                                             Annie: T-This is... okay, right? We're just... friends getting a little more comfortable.           Orion: Of c-course! Not a big deal. After all, I've seen Chang naked hundreds of times. More times  than I'd like, honestly.                                                                            Annie: *Laughs* Yeah, I remember that one time he dove into the school pool and came out of the     water missing his trunks. Everyone in class saw that!                                               Orion: *Laughs* True, I'd forgotten about that.                                                     Annie: (Be confident, Annie! You’ve made it this far, you can’t turn back now!) Well... umm...      hopefully you don’t forget about this...                                                            Orion: (Oh my god... I have now seen the light... My precious Annie... She's...)                    Annie: Um, Orion...? Oh man, I must look weird or someth—                                           Orion: Annie... you are so... beautiful...                                                          Annie: Oh, stop... I'm struggling trying to get over my embarrassment here... your jokes aren’t     helping...                                                                                          Orion: I'm not making fun of you! I'm telling you the truth.                                        Annie: Come on, I'm not like the other girls at school. I’m too short, too flat, and too...         Orion: Too perfect. That’s what you are.                                                            Annie: Umm... W-Well... um, anyways... we should probably try to get some sleep now...              Orion: Y-Yeah... you’re probably right.                                                             Annie: Any itchiness?                                                                               Orion: Not at all... I feel... much better.                                                         Annie: Mm, good!                                                                                    Orion: Your skin feels so soft, Annie. It feels... really nice holding you...                       Annie: T-Thank you. You f-feel really nice, too...                                                  Orion: And I love your smell. Strawberries, right?                                                  Annie: Y-Yes. It's my perfume. You... smell like... you. B-But I like it. I’ve always found your    scent comforting...                                                                                 Orion: (Oh my god, am I the only one feeling all this tension in the air? I want to make a move,    but... I don’t want to overstep my bounds...                                                        Annie: Oh god, he must feel my heartbeat going crazy. I’m so nervous, but I can’t help wanting      more...                                                                                             Orion: She feels so good in my arms... her body against mine... her chest moving with each breath...Annie: I feel so... safe in his arms... his hold is firm, yet so gentle and warm...                 Orion: Damn it, she feels too good, I’m getting hard...                                             Annie: Um, is that...? I think I can feel him... down there... Come on, Annie. Don’t be so naive.   You're topless in bed with a guy. What did you think was going to happen? But it’s not just any guy. It’s Orion. You've had a crush on him since you were nine years old. You’ve been fantasizing about this moment for so long. Now it’s finally here... what are you going to do about it?                Orion: I really want to move things forward... But... I don't want to scare her away. Annie has     always been so special to me. If I try something and it doesn't work out, I couldn’t bear the       thought of losing her...                                                                            Annie: I can’t deny it... I want more of him... But what if I screw things up? I don't want to lose him. He means too much to me... we’ve been through so much together...                              Orion: Then again, this is a side of her I’ve never seen before. Maybe it’s a sign. Should I...?)   Stop here                                                                                           Orion: (I better not risk it. This is the closest we’ve ever gotten and I shouldn’t push my luck.   Baby steps, Orion. Baby steps.) Goodnight, Annie.                                                   Annie: G-Good night, Orion. . . .                                                                   Go further                                                                                          Orion: (I’ve had too many regrets in life. I’m not going to add another to the list. Time to take a chance...) Um... Annie...?                                                                          Annie: Y-Yeah...?                                                                                   Orion: I’m just going to come right out and say it. I can’t help it, you’re really turning me on    right now...                                                                                        Annie: R-Really? W-Well... I guess that’s normal, given the circumstances. ...But, for what it’s    worth, you’re really turning me on too...                                                           Orion: I’m sorry, I know I must be really poking you right now...                                   Annie: *Nervous laughter* D-Don't worry! It's okay... It um... doesn't bother me.                   Orion: (Well, here goes nothing...                                                                  Annie: "Doesn't bother me"?? Really, Annie?! Couldn't you think of anything better to sa—) . . . !  (Is that his...?)                                                                                   Orion: I’m sorry, Annie... I can’t help it... you’re driving me insane... Are you okay with this...?Annie: Yes...  You feel... good there... But now I wanna know how you feel back here...             Orion: Oh god, Annie...                                                                             Annie: Does that feel okay...?                                                                      Orion: It does... C-Come here...                                                                    Annie: Ahh...                                                                                       Orion: You still... good...?                                                                        Annie: Yes... But... Now I’m the one feeling a little uncomfortable... It’s just, my pants...       They're rubbing against my...                                                                       Orion: Maybe I can help you this time... Move aside for a second...                                 Annie: Alright...                                                                                   Orion: Can I... take off your pants...?                                                             Annie: Orion... Um, I don’t know if I’m ready to go all the way toni-                               Orion: No, no. Of course. I just want to cuddle a little closer with you...                         Annie: Mmm, that does sound nice...                                                                 Orion: I just wanna feel your soft skin...                                                          Annie: *Giggles* I’m sorry. I’m just a little nervous because no one has ever touched me there      before, or even seen it, for that matter. Just you.                                                 Orion: I know. If it’s too much all at once, we can just...                                         Annie: Orion. I said I’m nervous, but that doesn’t mean I... don’t want to...                       Orion: Uhh—                                                                                         Annie: Pants off, right? To... feel more comfortable.                                               Orion: Y-Yeah. To feel more comfortable.                                                            Annie: Alright...                                                                                   Orion: (If this is a dream, please god don’t wake me up now...)                                     Annie: *Giggles* I can't believe I'm doing this. This is a side that I’ve never shown to anyone     before...                                                                                           Orion: Holy...                                                                                      Annie: Oh god... now I feel even more embarrassed...                                                Orion: Don’t be. Let me get a better look at you.                                                   Annie: B-Better... look...? Are you s-sure you...                                                   Orion: I’ve never been more sure, Annie. I've wanted you for so long.                               Annie: R-Really? But... I thought you weren’t interested in me...                                   Orion: Where did you get that idea from? You're perfect. And I’m not just saying that because I’m   finally seeing your gorgeous body. You’ve always been perfect to me... inside and out. I just didn’t want to risk ruining our friendship.                                                               Annie: W-What? M-Me either! W-Wait. This is all happening so fast... I'm still not ready for        anything... in there... But I do believe I was promised cuddles...?                                 Orion: *Chuckles* You know I’m not one to break my promises. *Kissing her neck* And don’t you worry. I’m perfectly fine with going as slow as you want. Better now? Without those pesky pants?          Annie: Y-Yeah... m-much better. You’re so warm...                                                   Orion: Do you mind if I move a bit? I want to feel all of you against me...                         Annie: Y-Yes... Oh m-my god.                                                                        Orion: Does that feel good for you too?                                                             Annie: Y-Yes... Oh Orion...                                                                         Orion: You’re... so wet... You like my dick gliding against you like that...?                       Annie: Mm-hm...                                                                                     Orion: Agh... I need to go faster...                                                                Annie: Please...                                                                                    Orion: You sure?                                                                                    Annie: Yes... AHH... OH MY... Just like that... not too fast, I’m so sensitive right now...         Orion: Oh Annie...                                                                                  Annie: Mmmm...                                                                                      Orion: (Holy shit, this is really happening! I'm fucking Annie's thighs! She feels so amazing...    Annie: Ahh... the way he’s grinding against my... mmmm... I never would’ve thought I’d have a chance with him...) Aaaaahh...                                                                            Orion: Jesus, Annie... The way you’re dripping all over my dick...                                  Annie: Orion... You’re making me feel so... so good down there...                                   Orion: AAaaahhh... Yeah... Just like that...                                                        Annie: (Oh my god... His... ...It's bigger than my arm! How... Is that what they’re supposed to look like?! That thing is supposed to fit inside of me...? All of it?! There's no way on Earth I could  take all of him. ...Right?) Aaaahhh... My god...                                                    Orion: Ahhh... I'm almost there...                                                                  Annie: (How can he feel so good? I’m just rubbing against it... I wonder how he’d feel inside of    me... But no... fitting all that... that’d be impossible... I'm too small, and he's just... too     big...) Mmmmhh...                                                                                   Orion: Oh Annie... I'm... I’m about to...                                                           Annie: (Well, maybe with a bit of practice...)                                                      Orion: I’m cumming!!!                                                                               Annie: (Together we could...)                                                                       Orion: AAaahhh!!                                                                                    Annie: W-What?                                                                                      Orion: Ohhhhhh!!                                                                                    Annie: Oh my god...                                                                                 Orion: Ahhhh.... Oh shit, I'm sorry, Annie...                                                       Annie: I... Oh god, I gotta go!                                                                     Orion: What? Did I do something wrong, Annie? I’m sorry! I didn’t know it was going to be that much!Annie: N-No! It wasn’t that! It was amazing! B-But then... T-Then you start thinking, Y-Y-YOU KNOW?! *Nervous giggle* L-Like... What j-just happened?! AGH! I got carried away, like I ALWAYS DO! I only came here t-to sleep and then... next thing I know I’m doing that... I mean, I just stuck your...  thing... in between my thighs... before I’ve even gotten my first k-kiss!! *Nervous giggle*         Orion: No, no! It's okay! You’re good! I like you, Annie! We can...                                 Annie: I started m-moving and then I c-couldn't stop and... now I’m not going to have my fairy tale ending... because what kind of Disney princess romance begins with a THIGH JOB?! AHAHAH!!           Orion: Annie...                                                                                     Annie: I was looking forward t-to this, b-but didn’t think it’d be like this! *Nervous laughter* I  mean...                                                                                             Orion: (She's not listening to me anymore...)                                                       Annie: We skipped like 14 steps! In one night! We didn't even kiss! And w-why did it feel so good?  Why am I naked? WHY DOES THIS THING TASTE SO SALTY?! What will Orion think of me after all of       this?!                                                                                              Orion: What? I'm right here! I’ll tell you right now what I think...                                Annie: How am I supposed to look at everyone tomorrow?! I... THINK! I need to think! Um... I'm      gonna... go... think! Good night Orion!                                                             Orion: Good— ...night. (Shit, I hope she goes back to her normal self in the morning. I'll talk to  her. I'll help her overcome her embarrassment... gotta show her that this wasn’t a mistake and it   actually meant something. I need to help her realize she can let her guard down and be her true self around me. After what just happened... And the things she said... how she felt... Maybe something  between us could work after all.  . . .  HOLY SHIT! All of that really happened! That was           incredible! That was my first time seeing Annie’s secret kinky side... and I loved every moment of  it! Maybe we can both explore it more together... Wow...) *Yawns* (Holy shit! It’s not raining      outside?! Maybe I should buy a lotto ticket today... I hope it stays like this all weekend.)        *Stretching* (Ahh, finally Saturday!! Man, what happened with Annie last night feels like a dream.  But it definitely wasn't... I should really talk to her about what happened. I hope she isn’t       regretting anything...)                                                                             Nancy: *Knocks* Orion? Are you up?                                                                  Orion: Yeah! Come on in.                                                                            Nancy: Good morning!                                                                                Orion: (Oh boy...) Morning, Nancy!                                                                  Nancy: See! I remembered to knock this time! I won’t forget after what happened the other day, don't worry.                                                                                             Orion: It's alright. Were you able to buy a lock for my door?                                       Nancy: Yeah I got it! I'll try to install it tomorrow... if I have time.                            Orion: You look sporty. *Chuckles* I told you it wasn’t a big deal at all! Nice outfit!             Nancy: Well thank you! I was just about to head out. Can’t be late for yoga class! Are you still    planning on joining me?                                                                             Orion: Of course!                                                                                   Nancy: Cool! I'll see you at the gym then.                                                          Orion: Huh? We're not going together?                                                               Nancy: Sorry but I’m in a bit of a rush. I have to leave now because I’m picking up a friend along  the way.                                                                                            Orion: A friend?                                                                                    Nancy: Yeah, she’s the mom of your classmate, Jamie. Do you know him?                               Orion: Hmmm... No, I don't think I've met him before.                                               Nancy: Well... to be honest, calling her a "friend" is a little bit of a stretch. She joined the    yoga class after discovering I was going there, too. Just between you and me, I think she's a bit   annoying, but I don't want to get on her bad side since she's a coworker and also happens to be the school’s PTA president.                                                                             Orion: Hey, I don't blame her. She probably thought yoga was the secret to your eternal youth.      Nancy: *Giggles* Oh, stop... Anyway, can you go wake up Dalia for me? I have to start the laundry   and prepare everyone a quick breakfast before I go. I'll leave the food on the kitchen counter.     Offer to make breakfast                                                                             Orion: Nonsense! You’re in a rush... leave the chores to me. If you don’t mind waking up Dalia, I’ll take care of the rest.                                                                             Nancy: What have I done to deserve such chivalry?                                                   Orion: What can I say, I'm a real catch.                                                            Nancy: *Laughs* It definitely looks like it... Alright then, I'll see you at the gym in a few!      Orion: Sure! See you then! (Hmmm... What should I prepare for breakfast? Knowing Dalia... that girl can eat! Some toast with a glass of milk won't be enough, that's for sure. Pancakes, maybe? I'm no  Gordon Ramsay, but I think I can pull it off.)                                                      Go wake up Dalia                                                                                    Orion: Sure thing. Would you mind preparing me a bagel with cream cheese?                           Nancy: Of course! No problem. I'll see you at the gym then!                                         Orion: Okay! See you later! (Dalia and I are supposed to work out together after yoga. If I remember correctly, I think they both go to the same gym. Hmmm... I should ask her if she wants to come with me or if she's gonna come later.)                                                                  Nancy: Anyway, I'll go wake up Dalia. I'll see you at the gym in 40 minutes!                        Orion: I'll be there! (Well, let's see how Kredon's gym looks. Man, I feel so invigorated today!    Let's go!)                                                                                          Nancy: I'm going to my yoga class.                                                                  Orion: Oh, yeah, true.                                                                              Nancy: Anyway, can you go wake up Dalia? I really have to go now.                                   Orion: Sure, no problem.                                                                            Nancy: Thank you!                                                                                   Orion: (I should prepare breakfast for Dalia one of these days. Although knowing her... that girl   can eat! Some toast with a glass of milk won't be enough, that's for sure. Pancakes, maybe? I'm no  Gordon Ramsay, but I might be able to pull something off.)                                          Nancy: Penelope and Annie have left already and Dalia is getting ready for the gym, so I’m leaving  you in charge of the house.                                                                         Orion: I'll keep the house safe, don't worry!                                                       Nancy: Alright then. Call me if you need anything. See you later.                                   Orion: Bye! (Well, I don't have anything to do until the afternoon. I have to meet up with Alex to  work on homework at 4:00 PM. But for now, I'll go take a shower and then enjoy a lazy morning on the couch. I deserve some rest!)                                                                       Dalia: Zzzzz...                                                                                     Orion: Dalia? Good morning!                                                                         Dalia: Zzzzz...                                                                                     Orion: Dalia? (She’s must be in some deep sleep. And Carolyn looks like she’s happily off in dream  land too! Oh my god, this is adorable. I almost feel bad for waking her up. I should probably be as gentle as I can...) Psst. *Whispering* Dalia. *Whispering* Daaaaliaa... *Whispering* Wake up,       Sleeping Beauty...                                                                                  Dalia: Hhmm...                                                                                      Orion: *Whispering* Dalia...                                                                        Dalia: Mmm... (Huh?) W-WHAT THE FUCK?!                                                              Orion: Ouch...                                                                                      Dalia: The fuck is wrong with you?! How long have you been watching me sleep, you fucking lunatic?! Orion: I just got here, shit! Nancy told me to wake you up! Why did you hit me?!                    Dalia: W-Well, you scared me. First thing I saw when I opened my eyes was you staring at me like a  psycho!                                                                                             Orion: Damn, what a kick...                                                                         Dalia: Anyway, what's the rush? It's Saturday... it’s supposed to be the day we can actually sleep  in for once!                                                                                        Nancy: Dalia! Good morning, honey! Come on now, it’s time to get up!                                Dalia: Hhmm...                                                                                      Nancy: Dalia... You wanted me to wake you up...                                                     Dalia: Mm-hhmmm...                                                                                  Nancy: Come on Dalia, I have to go to yoga! Don’t make me do this the hard way!                     Dalia: Hhhmm... Zzzzz...                                                                            Nancy: . . .                                                                                        Dalia: Zzzzzzz...                                                                                   Nancy: . . .                                                                                        Dalia: EEERGH! W-WHAT?! WHO?! WHERE?!!  EEERGH! W-WHAT?! WHO?! WHERE?!!  EEERGH! W-WHAT?! WHO?!     WHERE?!!  EEERGH! W-WHAT?! WHO?! WHERE?!!  EEERGH! W-WHAT?! WHO?! WHERE?!!  EEERGH! W-WHAT?! WHO?!  WHERE?!!  Aghh... Why’d you have to do that... It's Saturday!                                       Nancy: You asked me to wake you up, remember?                                                       Dalia: *Yawns* Well, I take it back.                                                                Nancy: Come on, it's 9:20 already. If you waste away your morning, you’re going to regret it later. And then you'll be in a bad mood all day!                                                           Dalia: No I won’t...                                                                                Nancy: I don't even understand how you can sleep so much! You were the first to go to bed and now   you’re the last to get up. You've slept for like... 10 hours?                                       Dalia: Because I work out a lot... and my... *yawns* body needs its recovery.                       Nancy: Well, you've recovered enough. Come on now, let’s get you up.                                Dalia: Mommmm...                                                                                    Nancy: Now, now... don't "Mommmm" me.                                                               Dalia: Mmmmph... Okay, okay... fine, I'm getting up...                                              Nancy: You better be! Otherwise, Miss Carolyn will come and tell me, won’t you sweetie?             Carolyn: *Purring*                                                                                  Nancy: That's right, you're such a good girl, you know that?? Unlike Sleeping Beauty over here, you can sleep as much as you want! You deserve it for being so cute! Ok, I really have to leave now.    I'll see you later, honey. Don't you fall back asleep!                                              Dalia: I won't...                                                                                   Nancy: Bye Carolyn!                                                                                 Carolyn: *Meows*                                                                                    Orion: Dalia? Are you up?                                                                           Dalia: Arghh... Just when I thought my morning couldn’t get any better... Yeah, yeah, I'm awake.    Tell Mom I'll be at the gym in 5 minutes.                                                           Orion: I think she left already.                                                                    Dalia: Oh... Good. Guess I can sleep a couple more hours then...                                    Orion: You sure about that? I made you breakfast... Pancakes! Well, considering how much you eat... it'll probably just be your first round of breakfast, but anyway...                                 Dalia: ...what? Did you say... pancakes...? *Sniffs* PANCAKES!! YAY!! Are they all for me?          Orion: Yep!                                                                                         Dalia: Mmmmm!                                                                                       Orion: My god! You devoured that thing in like 10 seconds! How on earth... You sure have quite the  appetite.                                                                                           Dalia: What can I say... I love eating, sleeping, and working out. The foundation of a good life!   Orion: *Laughs* Fair enough.                                                                        Dalia: I gotta say, those were some damn good pancakes. Thank you, Orion.                           Orion: Don't mention it. You know, I almost didn’t recognize you without your braids and bangs      covering your eye.                                                                                  Dalia: Yeah, well, I haven't done my hair and makeup yet... and I just woke up! I don't know what   you were expecting. I'd like to see your bed head first thing in the morning!                       Orion: Hey, I didn’t say you looked ugly! On the contrary, I actually think you look really lovely  right now... (And can’t help but notice that lovely view of sideboob... mmm! No Orion! Must...      maintain... eye contact...)                                                                         Dalia: Y-Yeah, sure, if you say so... Thank you for the lie... as flattering as it is. Anyway,      what's the rush with you and Mom trying to get me up? Are we supposed to be somewhere, or           something?                                                                                          Orion: I thought we were going to train together today.                                             Dalia: Oh, yeah! Of course! How could I forget! Today you're gonna learn what a real workout feels  like.                                                                                               Orion: Hmmm... I'm not so sure about that, Dalia. I've seen broom sticks thicker than your biceps.  Dalia: Haa.. haaa... You’re one to talk! Your abs are only visible because you're skinny. It’s like a fat girl bragging about having boobs. It’s cheating! It’s not my fault, women just have a tougher time building upper body strength. My real strength lies in my lower body!                          Orion: I don’t doubt you there...                                                                   Dalia: I can squat 285 lbs! And I'll show you today!                                                Orion: Well alright then, I’ll hold you to it! First I'm going to yoga class with Nancy, though.    Dalia: Ha! Sure, go ahead. You look about as flexible as a log. I still don’t think it’s very wise  of you though. Gonna exhaust yourself before the true workout begins? I’ll get the wheelchair       ready... *Jumping out of bed* Come on, let's get going then!                                        Carolyn: *Meows*                                                                                    Orion: Um... A-Are you okay, Dalia? D-Dalia?!                                                       Dalia: My back...                                                                                   Orion: What?!                                                                                       Dalia: MY BACK!!! I think I just tweaked it... I c-can't move.                                      Orion: Oh shit! Should I call an ambulance?                                                         Dalia: No... this has happened to me before. I must’ve lifted too much weight yesterday... It'll    heal with rest, but now I’ll be out of the gym for at least a week!!                                Orion: Oh... Thank god, I thought it was more serious.                                              Dalia: Don't you understand?! The weightlifting competition is next week! Even if I'm healed by     then, I can't afford to miss out on a whole week of training! Not after all the progress I’ve made  this entire year! Micaela will humiliate me again! And everyone is just gonna laugh at me! I'll be  Kredon's biggest loser yet again! I'm a miserable mess...                                           Orion: Come on, come on... don’t talk like that! It's no big deal. Can you sit up? Let me help you. Why don’t I give you a massage. I am known to be quite the massaging miracle maker! I remember when Chang hurt his back pretty bad when he tried to climb onto the roof of our school a few years ago.  After that incident, I watched a Cambodian masseur on YouTube and learned how to give massages for  muscle injury relief. He was back to normal in no time!                                             Dalia: How romantic... Well I hope you know what you're doing.                                      Orion: I do. Just trust me. But first, I need you to relax your muscles a bit. Try thinking about   something else.                                                                                     Dalia: Thinking? About what?                                                                        Orion: I don't know. Did you get to play Eternum last night?                                        Dalia: Yeah, I did for a little while, but I didn't find anything good. How about you?              Orion: I played with Annie and Luna. We ended up finding something that could be... pretty          important. But we’re not sure yet. I played with Luna and we ended up finding something that could  be... pretty important. But we’re not sure yet.                                                     Dalia: What? What’d you find?                                                                       Orion: I'll show you when we play together next time. It'll be a surprise!                          Dalia: Bahh...                                                                                      Orion: Speaking of Eternum, have you heard anything from Jerry?                                     Dalia: Ah, yeah, he continues to text me every day... He ended up losing his level and entire       inventory. I tried to explain that you and I couldn't recover his stuff because we ran into         Thanatos, but he doesn't believe me. He's convinced that you killed him with some dirty trick.      Orion: Nonsense. The ogre killed him.                                                               Dalia: That's what I told him, but he didn't see any ogre.                                          Orion: Well yeah, probably because he pretty much got insta-killed. Poor Jerry. Well, I hope he’s   able to rebuild his account soon... He seemed nice. I feel so bad for him...                        Dalia: He’s definitely a bit of a pain sometimes, but I will admit he is a good spell caster. I     think he’ll be able to recover pretty quickly.                                                      Orion: Well, I think we're just about done here. Feel any better?                                   Dalia: Hey... y-yeah, actually! I do feel a bit better! Not bad, Mr. Magic Hands!                   Orion: I’m going to grab you an ice pack real quick. Just leave that on your back and get some REST! Lie down, watch TV, play some Eternum... whatever you prefer. I’m going to give you another massage tomorrow. We have to continue working your muscles. If you listen to me and don’t try to sneak off for a secret workout, you'll be recovered before next Friday. And you’ll be stronger than ever!     Dalia: Okay, I trust you. Thank you, Orion.                                                         Orion: Anytime, Dalia.                                                                              Dalia: Annie! Good morning!                                                                         Annie: D-D-D-Dalia! M-Morning!                                                                      Orion: Annie! Do you have a minute? I wanted to talk to you!                                        Annie: M-M-Me? I c-c-can't! I h-have to... Um... You know... *Nervously giggles* I'm late for... I  gotta be at the... *Runs away*                                                                      Dalia: Hmm? That was weird. She seemed... more shy than usual.                                      Orion: Y-Yeah, maybe she had a rough night or something. (Hmph. She probably needs more time. I’ll  try to talk to her again tomorrow...)                                                               Dalia: Anyway, you're going with Mom to that yoga thing, right?                                     Orion: Yep! I should actually get going now or else I’ll be late.                                   Dalia: Okay then, well have fun. Anyway, do you have any plans for today?                           Orion: Not really. I’m going to meet with Alex this afternoon to work on our project, but until     then, I'm just going to spend the morning chilling around the house.                                Dalia: Sounds like a good plan. Our training has obviously been postponed, but only until I’m back  in action next week! Don't think you're getting off the hook that easily!                           Orion: *Laughs* Of course not. I'm looking forward to it!                                           Dalia: See you later!                                                                               Orion: Bye! And try to take it easy! (Alright... Kredon's gym. Man, there’s a lot of fit,           good-looking people here. And not a single person I recognize. I probably look so out of place right now...)                                                                                            Nancy: Hey there, handsome.                                                                         Orion: *Turning around* Oh Nancy, thank god! Man, I hate being the new guy at places. I was starting to feel a little insecure around all these beautiful people.                                       Nancy: *Chuckles* What are you talking about? I think you’re better looking than anyone else here.  Orion: You’re just saying that because you feel sorry for me.                                       Nancy: *Giggles* That's not true at all! I meant what I said.                                       Orion: Yeah, that’s just your maternal instinct. It’s like when a mom says that her son is the most beautiful baby in the world, even though it looks like E.T.                                         Nancy: *Laughs* I don't think that's it at all...                                                   Orion: *Chuckles* So... This is the gym where you and Dalia usually go, huh? It looks so modern.    Nancy: Yeah, they just opened a few years ago. The things I love most about this place are the      personal training sessions and variety of activities available. There's something for everyone. I   know I wouldn’t be able to keep up with someone like Dalia in the weight room, but luckily they’ve  got other activities like yoga and kickboxing that are right up my alley.                           Orion: Are you kidding me?! You kickbox? I didn't know that!                                        Nancy: Oh, there's a lot you don't know about me, Orion... Come on, let's head over to the front    desk! We'll get you registered as a member so you can come whenever you want.                       Orion: Sounds good!                                                                                 Nancy: Good morning, Millie!                                                                        Millie: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Mama-mia! The hottest Mom in Kredon has arrived!                          Nancy: Oh, you’re just too much!                                                                    Millie: How are you, cutie?                                                                         Nancy: All good, thanks! And you?                                                                   Millie: Meh, you know. Living the dream. Behind this desk. Like always... It’s Saturday... so you’re here for your yoga session, right?                                                                 Nancy: Yeah, but I brought someone with me today.                                                   Millie: Oh, nice! Finally got yourself a hot boyfriend like I told you, huh? Pack it up gents, she’s off the market!!                                                                                   Nancy: *Laughs* It's not that. Orion is staying with us for a year until he finishes school. He’s   part of the student exchange program.                                                               Orion: Well, I’m hoping I get accepted into Kredon’s college for next year. If I can manage that, I would love to stay here.                                                                            Nancy: Oh, trying to stay with us indefinitely, I see?                                              Orion: Just until Dalia realizes that I'm eating her peanut-butter cookies.                         Nancy: *Laughs* Oh, you're so dead!                                                                 Millie: Well, well, well, Orion! If you’ve come to get stronger, shed those peanut-butter cookie    pounds, or become the best trapeze artist in North America—you've come to the right place! You can  do it all here at PUMP IT! We’ve got so many dumbbells, locker rooms with good smells, a coach who  gently yells, and plenty of fit bombshells! Don’t believe me? Check our membership count—this place sells! All for the low cost of $36 a month! That’s like $1.16 a day!                                Orion: *Laughs* Alright, alright! You got me. I’m sold!                                             Millie: Awesome! Since you’re signing up today, you can join any of the activities that we have     scheduled for this beautiful Saturday morning!                                                      Orion: Yeah, I think I was going to try out the yog-                                                Millie: AH, AH, AH! First, let me introduce you to our personal trainers!                           Orion: Um... alright, go ahead.                                                                     Millie: We’ve got four of them and they’re all amazing! Are you looking for swimming lessons? Want  to step up your water polo game? Learn how to high dive? Directly from Yekaterinburg, I present to  you... Nikolay! As Nikolay always says...                                                           Nikolay: Границы России нигде не заканчиваются.                                                     Orion: W-What?                                                                                      Millie: Want to learn self-defense? Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu? How to deliver a roundhouse kick to the    face?? Moon is your girl! As Moon always says...                                                    Moon: I have to go. See you Monday.                                                                 Millie: Are you interested in... Wait, what?! That's not a slogan, Moon! Come on, I told you to come up with a slogan!                                                                                  Moon: I know, I was just letting you know I was leaving.                                            Millie: But you just got here!                                                                      Moon: Someone called me. It's... something important.                                               Millie: Have you told the boss?                                                                     Moon: No. But I'm sure he won't find out, as long as you don’t say anything. See you Monday, Millie.Millie: AAAAH! OK, OK! Ok, forget about the combat classes, Orion. *Clears throat* Where was I...   Are you interested in cleansing your soul, while also increasing your flexibility? Do you want to   become one with the universe?! Kai is your man! As Kai always says...                               Kai: It doesn’t matter how deep into a pose you go – what does matter is who you are when you get   there.                                                                                              Millie: Do you want to finally fill out the sleeves of that extra-small t-shirt of yours? Improve   your endurance and stamina? Look no further than Chang!                                             Orion: W-What?                                                                                      Millie: As Chang always says...                                                                     Chang: It doesn’t matter how deep into a squat you go – what does matter is who you are when you get there.                                                                                             Kai: HEY! This motherfucker stole my slogan!                                                        Chang: What! I did not! Mine is totally different!                                                  Kai: Don't play dumb with me!                                                                       Orion: H-How... When... Why... You know what, forget it. I’m not even going to ask. Yeah, I think   I’ll just be off to that yoga class... with Nancy.                                                  Millie: Oh awesome! You should’ve said something earlier! Alright, I'll fill out your membership    form! Hope you enjoy your time here at... PUMP IT!!                                                 Orion: Thank you!                                                                                   Nancy: I’m going to drop off my bag in the locker room. I'll meet you in the yoga room. It’s on the second floor.                                                                                       Orion: Alright! I'll see you there. I just need to talk to... someone for a minute... then I'll be  right up.                                                                                           Chang: Come on, Shiro! You need to go faster, don't stop now! Imagine there’s a donut in front of   you! GET. THAT. DONUT!! Go, go, go!                                                                 Shiro: Yes, sensei!                                                                                 Orion: Um... C-Chang?                                                                               Chang: Huh? Orion! You truly have a gift for showing up at the most unexpected times!               Orion: I should be the one telling you that! Personal trainer? Strength coach? What the hell?       Chang: Yeah, well, I mainly came here hoping to see Micaela. And maybe get in shape too, you know... The receptionist told me they were looking to hire personal trainers, and I guess I got a bit      carried away when she asked me about my fitness skills. She ended up offering me a job and... what  do you know, here I am!                                                                             Orion: I... *Laughs* I don't know what to say, man. Congrats, I guess.                              Chang: Thanks, buddy.                                                                               Orion: What the fuck is that shirt, though?                                                         Chang: Fits me just right, huh? I accidentally spilled Big Mac sauce on my shirt, so I needed to    change. Ended up finding some fresh clothes in the employee break room.                             Orion: Um... It says... "breed me" on the back.                                                     Chang: *Laughs* Now that would be hilarious!                                                        Orion: No, no, seriously, it says that.                                                             Chang: Wait, what?                                                                                  Orion: And it has a silhouette of a pregnant woman.                                                 Chang: What? Oh shit... Do you think that's why the Sauna Sweaty Lovers Club said to join them when I get off shift?                                                                                    Orion: Um... it's a possibility.                                                                    Chang: Fuck, I gotta go. Thanks for the heads up, man. You're my savior.                            Orion: *Laughs* Any time, bro. And I think you should keep this job! You'll make Micaela fall in    love with you. I believe in you!                                                                    Chang: Oh, yeah, now that you mention it... I wanted to ask you something.                          Orion: Shoot.                                                                                       Chang: Micaela's birthday is next week. I thought of getting her something special, but I’m not     quite sure what yet. Do you have any idea? Please! My future family of 13 is in your hands!         Orion: Hmm...                                                                                       Flowers                                                                                             Orion: The girls who look the toughest on the outside are always the sweetest on the inside. Get her a bouquet of flowers. Trust me, it never fails. It’s a classic for a reason.                       A dumbbell                                                                                          Orion: She obviously is very passionate about fitness. You should get her something related to that hobby. Maybe get her a dumbbell or something similar. Trust me, she'll love it.                     A ticket to a show                                                                                  Orion: Is she a fan of any particular band or comedian? Get her a ticket to a show that you know    she’ll enjoy. You can show her that you pay attention to what she likes. Then boom, you somehow have an extra ticket for yourself too, so then you end up joining her! A gift and a date! Two birds with one stone, baby.                                                                                   Nothing                                                                                             Orion: Girls don't like men that chase. It looks desperate and needy. Don't get her anything. Act   tough, hold your ground, and then just wait. She’ll come crawling to you in no time, trust me.      Chang: Ah, you're the best, man! I owe you one! Thank you!                                          Orion: Anytime!                                                                                     Chang: Alright, I think it’s about time I changed out of this shirt. I'll text you later!           Orion: Sure thing, take care! (I hope I've given him good advice. Well, time will tell. Time for    some yoga! Oh... They have a nice spot up here. Who do we have here...) Oh... So this is yoga. It   looks pretty intense! Mind if I join you in your little nap session?                                Nancy: I'm just stretching out the hammies, silly. And you should do it too if you want to save     yourself from some embarrassment later.                                                             Orion: *Chuckles* I think I can handle a little bit of yoga. Grandmas do this stuff all the time,   don’t they?                                                                                         Nancy: I admire your cockiness. Hold onto it while you can... you’re about to be humbled very soon. Orion: *Laughs* What? Is this a competitive sport now? I thought yoga was about finding balance in  one’s mind, body, and soul...                                                                       Nancy: Life is always some sort of a competition, Orion. If not against others, then against        yourself. But if this isn't enough for you... I can also kick your ass at kickboxing when we’re done here.                                                                                              Orion: *Laughs* I'm sure you would. Maybe another day, I can’t risk bruising this handsome face.    Nancy: Ahh... Smart! *Laughs* But seriously, all joking aside, you should really stretch out a      little bit. It'll help with the elasticity of your muscles. And it will also prevent injuries.      Orion: *Stretching out* You're not wrong there.                                                     Nancy: Ah, looks like more people are starting to arrive. I guess not many people signed up today,  so at least we’ll have plenty of space to ourselves. Hopefully it'll only be 5 or 6 people.         Orion: Hey! I know those guys!                                                                      Nancy: Oh, you've met Noah and Raul? You’ll come to see that Kredon is a lot smaller than it looks, so I’m sure you’ll cross paths with familiar faces all the time.                                    Orion: Yeah, I know them from school.                                                               Nancy: I didn't know they were teachers! How nice!                                                  Orion: Um... Well, no, they're actually students. They share a couple classes with me and Dalia.    Nancy: W-What?                                                                                      Raul: Hmm? M'lady. Orion.                                                                           Orion: Sup' man! Good to see you.                                                                   Nancy: Hey Raul! Good morning! Well, regardless, they're both really nice. And they always seem to  be together! Like two peas in a pod.                                                                Orion: Yeah, they’re the same way at school. I've never seen one without the other. *Laughs* I think our teacher is scared of them.                                                                     Nancy: Really? That's silly. They might look intimidating at first, but you just need to talk to    them and then you’ll realize they're so sweet. I guess you could say that they’re...                Gertrude: Heyyyyy giiiiiirl! I was looking for you in the locker room, Nan! After I came out of the bathroom, you disappeared! Where did you run off to?                                                Nancy: H-Hey there. Sorry, I had to uhh... refill my water bottle... gotta stay hydrated, you       know... This is my... friend... Gertrude. Gertrude, this is...                                      Gertrude: Ohhh, am I finally getting to meet Dalia?! *Whispers loudly* I always thought that Dalia  was a girl...                                                                                       Orion: What? I'm not Dalia. My name is Orion.                                                       Gertrude: Mmm, fancy yourself a yoga session, huh Dalia? Did you know that your mother and I are    known as the "Forever Young Ladies" at this gym?                                                    Orion: Like I said, I’m not Dalia...                                                                Nancy: Yeah, well, I'm honestly not sure if anyone really calls us that.                            Orion: (If someone does, I don’t think they were applying that nickname to Gertrude...)             Gertrude: Everyone does! All the time! I'm even starting to hear it at work and during our PTA      meetings. *Hearty laugh* Because... well, I don't like to brag, but... I’ll have you know I'm the   president of Kredon's School PTA. *Grinning cheekily* That’s right... the PTA.                      Orion: (I can’t give her the satisfaction...) PTA? Never heard of it. Is that like the... Pakistan  Telecommunication Authority or something?                                                           Gertrude: You know, maybe Nancy would also hear more compliments if she ever left her lab!          Nancy: Well, the most recent Ulysses contract has been keeping me very busy, you know.              Orion: Ulysses? Eternum's parent company? I thought you worked in the research field.               Nancy: I do! They actually hired us to conduct a stem cell study a few weeks ago. I guess when      you’re the largest conglomerate on the planet, you become involved in many sectors. I heard they're also planning to get into the narcotics industry soon.                                              Orion: Damn... technology, entertainment, banking... and now science too? These people have their   hands in everything!                                                                                Nancy: But... if you're wondering if I can get a free neural implant as a perk of the job, I can't. We're just one of hundreds of subcontracts they have.                                               Kai: *Turning on the speaker* *Taking a deep breath* *Exhaling slowly* Welcome, my cherished        students. Nothing brightens up my life more than seeing each of your dreamy faces. I don’t know     where life has taken you this week, but rest assured, you’ve now arrived at the destination where   you ultimately belong. Yoga with Kai. Let us take a minute to reflect on our previous journeys, and then ready our minds for purification... and prepare our bodies to be relieved from the stress of   this cruel world. As soon as I walked into this room, I sensed new auras. And now I know why, as I  see some new faces. Welcome, my children. I’m so pleased to see some familiar ones too, though. Good to see you again, Raul, Noah, Gertrude... *Kissing her hand* And of course... my beautiful little  dove, Nancy.                                                                                        Nancy: Um... Thanks, Kai. You're always so flattering.                                              Kai: Flattery...? No, my Nancy. I am only speaking my truth. And truth should never be told to      someone who is not worthy of it. You, my dear, are always worthy. It’s always such a pleasure       whenever I see you in my class. When I was greeted by the warmth of this morning’s sun, it reminded me of the warmth that I feel around y—                                                              Orion: *Clears throat* Well uhh, shall we get to it then?? No need to waste anymore of this morning sun...                                                                                              Kai: Ah! Hello, my boy. Welcome to your reawakening. I'm Mr. Kainan, from Kainan Engineering. But no need for the formalities... you can call me Kai. For no matter what esteemed backgrounds we come   from, when we are in this place... we are all... equals.                                            Orion: Kainan Engineering? But aren't you a yoga teacher?                                           Kai: Well, isn't yoga another type of engineering after all? Engineering of the body... of the      soul...                                                                                             Orion: Um... No?                                                                                    Kai: Ah, a non-believer! Are you one of Nikolay's pupils?                                           Orion: No, I came with Nancy.                                                                       Kai: Oh, really? You two know each other? Well I’m glad to meet you, because I’m positive you’re    going to be seeing a lot more of me soon...                                                         Orion: What does that mean?                                                                         Kai: Ok my precious flowers, please take your places on your mats. We're about to elevate ourselves and break free of this week’s chains. As always, remember to relax and let yourselves be transported by the sound of the music and my sultry voice. First exercise... You are all doing marvelous...    Remember... Close your eyes, take a deep breath... And then exhale very slowly as we transition onto our final pose...                                                                                  Nancy: *Exhales slowly*                                                                             Kai: Perfect, Nancy... your graceful movements are simply unmatched...                              Orion: Grrr...                                                                                      Kai: Your foot has to touch your back, Orion.                                                       Orion: *Grinding your teeth* You think I don’t know that?! I'm f-fucking trying. I can’t raise it   any higher!                                                                                         Kai: Connect with your foot. Feel the breeze between your toes. Channel your inner energy. You are  only limiting yourself, Orion. Focus on your elasticity.                                            Orion: *Whispering to yourself* I wonder how elastic your neck is...                                Kai: Well done, Raul.                                                                               Orion: (How the fuck is he doing that?!)                                                            Kai: Alright, fantastic efforts everyone! Our last movement will be an Acro pose and must be done in pairs. So... Raul should go with Noah, Orion with Gertrude, and... oh! I guess that leaves me with you, Nancy.                                                                                         Orion: (Of course...)                                                                               Kai: You were so impressive today, Nan... Have you been practicing a lot at home?                   Gertrude: Ahh... they make a really lovely couple, don't you think, Dalia?                          Orion: How many times do I have to tell you that I'm not Dalia? My name is Orion! And no, I think   they'd make a horrible couple!                                                                      Gertrude: I mean, obviously Kai would’ve asked me out if I wasn’t already married, but since I’m    happily taken... Nancy will be a very good fit for him.                                             Orion: Nancy would never date a guy like that.                                                      Gertrude: Well, I’m not one to gossip, but she already told me that she likes him... And guess what else I heard?! He's going to ask her out on a date after class!                                     Orion: What?! That can’t be true.                                                                   Gertrude: Oh... it is! Just wait and watch! Ahh, there’s nothing like witnessing newfound love...   Orion: (S-She isn’t interested in him... right? Oh shit, but... what if she is? Nancy could say     yes... then they’ll start dating, and then... No! I can’t let that happen! Or can I? I mean... Why  am I so jealous in the first place? It's not like anything could happen between Nancy and I         anyways... Maybe I should let it be. She deserves to be happy. Who am I to interfere with her       personal life...)                                                                                   Stay out of Nancy's private life                                                                    Orion: (I shouldn't get involved in this. Nancy is her own woman. She doesn't need to be protected  and she’s more than capable of making her own decisions.)                                           Do something                                                                                        Orion: (Fuck that. I can’t stand the thought of her being with that hippie. This guy isn’t going to put his fluffy hands on her. I need to figure out a way to wrap this class up already...) Hmm...    (Maybe the Repeaters could help me?) *Whispering* Psst! Hey! Raul! Noah!                            Noah: Hmm?                                                                                          Raul: Yes?                                                                                          Orion: Have you seen the way this... Kai... is conducting his class? A little too handsy, don't you think?                                                                                              Raul: Ehh... I don't know, he has never touched me.                                                 Orion: Well, maybe not you, but... it just seems like he’s trying awfully hard to get close to      Nancy...                                                                                            Noah: . . . .                                                                                       Raul: . . . .                                                                                       Orion: So... Maybe you could... I don’t know, distract him?                                         Noah: . . . .                                                                                       Raul: . . . . Distract?                                                                             Orion: Y-Yeah, I know Nancy very well, and honestly she’s been in quite a heightened emotional state lately. I can’t bear the thought of that guy taking advantage of her.                              Noah: . . . .                                                                                       Raul: . . . . So you want us to get rid of him?                                                     Orion: *Laughs* Well, when you say it like that, it sounds like you're gonna kill him or something. Noah: . . . .                                                                                       Raul: . . . .                                                                                       Orion: Um... S-Seriously, don't hurt him. I just think I should be the one doing that last pose with her, instead of him. Then I know she’ll be safe. Can you just distract him so he has to leave for a moment...                                                                                          Noah: . . . .                                                                                       Raul: . . . . And what's in it for us?                                                              Orion: I noticed you two missed class yesterday. I can lend you my notes! All of them!              Noah: . . . .                                                                                       Raul: . . . . We're not really interested. But we can help you in exchange for money.               Orion: Erm... well, I don’t really like to carry around cash.                                       Raul: Do you play Eternum? You can pay us with eternals. They're... harder to track.                Orion: Oh! I wasn't expecting you to be Eternumites too! Yeah, I can do that. I'll send you 5       eternals. Go get yourselves a beer, my treat!                                                       Raul: 50.                                                                                           Orion: 50?! I’m a new player! I’m not very rich! You guys are just joking, right?                   Noah: . . . .                                                                                       Raul: . . . .                                                                                       Orion: I guess not...                                                                               Hire Noah and Raul                                                                                  Orion: *Sighs* Okay, okay, have 10 beers then! But you better cheers to my good health!             Forget it                                                                                           Orion: No way I'm paying you guys that. You know what, forget it. Nancy is her own woman. She       doesn't need to be protected and she’s more than capable of making her own decisions. This was a    silly idea. I'll just see you guys around, then.                                                    Raul: Have a good day, sir. Alright, Noah will take care of it. Pleasure doing business with you,   Orion.                                                                                              Orion: Sure, I’ll think of it as treating some friends to lunch.                                    Raul: My Eternum ID is 275,100,101. Don't forget to wire me the money when you go online next time. Orion: Sure, I will.                                                                                Raul: Great.                                                                                        Kai: Damn... Look at that perfectly toned stomach... And to think she's had 2 daughters!            Unbelievable. She's perfect, isn’t she, Raul?                                                       Raul: I don't know, Mr. Kai.                                                                        Kai: It's just... there's something about redheads that... I don't know, they drive me crazy. They  truly are a masterpiece and testament to the beauty of this world. What on earth could top a        beautiful redhead, Raul?                                                                            Raul: Jesus Christ?                                                                                 Kai: I'm gonna ask her out today. When the class is over, she’s going to be mine. I've been         fantasizing about how those beautiful tits look for far too long. Ever since she first stepped foot into my class...                                                                                    Millie: Kai!                                                                                        Kai: Hmm?                                                                                           Millie: There’s a car in the parking lot that started smoking! It looks like it's coming from the   engine! I t-think it's your car!                                                                    Kai: What?!                                                                                         Raul: Oh... yeah, that usually happens when you leave your car in the sunlight for too long. There  must be some extra warmth coming from the morning sun today.                                        Kai: Fuck, no! I’m still paying that thing off! Sorry guys, I’m going to have to conclude this class early! Millie, call the fire department!                                                           Millie: Right away!!                                                                                Gertrude: Well, looks like class is ending early today. That’s a shame, I would’ve loved to try out that pose with you, Dalia! Nan, honey, I'm going to the bathroom again. Just wait for me here!      Nancy: Sure thing.                                                                                  Orion: Jeez, talk about bad luck. Poor Kai... I guess I should start rolling up my mat.             Nancy: Not so fast! We still have one last pose to do! After all that hotshot talk earlier, I’m not going to let you off that easily!                                                                   Orion: Oh, the pose with a partner? Sounds good! I was hoping to do it with you... as uhh, lovely as Gertrude may be... I don't know how it's done, though.                                             Nancy: No worries. Just follow my lead. I’ll do the hard part. You just have to lie down on the     floor.                                                                                              Orion: *Chuckles* Now that sounds like something I can do! Like this?                               Nancy: Yeah! Now place your hands on the floor and raise your legs until they are perpendicular to  the ground. *Giggles* Yep, just like that! Now hold it steady! I'm going to get on top of your feet. Take hold of my arm and don't move your legs!                                                      Orion: Whoa! You good up there?                                                                     Nancy: *Giggles* Yeah, I've always had a pretty good sense of balance. But I’m trusting you         here—don't let me go!                                                                               Orion: *Chuckles* I could never do that...                                                          Nancy: Alright... Now just relax, let the music flow through you, and try to think of us like we’ve become one being. Close your eyes and synchronize your breathing with mine...                       Orion: (Wow... What is this sensation? I can feel her steady pulse and her deep breaths in sync with mine... It's as if nobody else exists... it’s only... us...)                                       Nancy: Oh no... I think I’m losing my balance! Ahhh! Oh my god, I'm so sorry! I felt like we... were having a moment there or something...                                                              Orion: It's o-okay! Don't worry, you didn't hurt me. *Sitting up* I guess I need a little more      practice...                                                                                         Nancy: No, no! That was all my fault. I think I relaxed a bit too much...                           Orion: Well... I guess we’re both going to have to practice a little bit more then. Together.       Nancy: Seems fair to me. I'm sure we can both learn a lot of things from each other...              Orion: I'm looking forward to it...                                                                 Nancy: Me too. You know... your return to Kredon has been the best thing that has happened to me in a long time, Orion. Just when my life began to feel so stale... so monotonous... You showed up. And you’ve brought so much joy to our lives in just the few days you’ve been here. To my life,          especially. *Giggles* Just like when I was your babysitter. How can you always turn each moment of  the day into something so memorable? I’ve already caught myself numerous times giggling like a      little girl as I reflected on our encounters...                                                     Orion: Well, I kind of just... go for things. I seize the moment. I prefer to leave my regrets      behind me. That's my principle.                                                                     Nancy: Mmm, that's some good advice. Can I ask you something?                                       Orion: Of course.                                                                                   Nancy: Do you ever think about... whether you and I—                                                Gertrude: Naaaan? How long do I have to wait for you?                                               Nancy: G-Gertrude! Y-Yeah, sure, sorry, I got distracted.                                           Gertrude: I've been waiting downstairs for ten whole minutes! It's noon already!                    Nancy: W-Wow, I guess time sure has flown by...                                                     Gertrude: Come on, I know a great vegan restaurant. I'll let you invite me to lunch.                Nancy: S-Sure, let's go.                                                                            Orion: *Standing up* Well, I guess I should go now too. I'll let you eat with your... best friend.  *Whispering* Good luck with that.                                                                   Nancy: *Laughs* Thank you. Do you have any plans for today?                                         Orion: I'm going to grab a quick bite because I'm meeting a friend this afternoon. We’re going to   work on a school project.                                                                           Nancy: Ah, nice. Good luck! Hope you’re able to get a lot done!                                     Orion: Thanks! I'll see you later tonight then! Take care, Nancy!                                   Nancy: You too, Orion. *Sighs*                                                                      Gertrude: Dalia is such a good boy, isn't he?                                                       Nancy: Yeah, he definitely is... Hm... Anyways, let's get going.                                    Kai: Nancy?! Oh thank mother nature, you're still here!                                             Nancy: Kai! (Maybe he can help me...) Gertrude, can you go on ahead? I'll join you in a minute. I   wanna ask Kai something.                                                                            Gertrude: *Hearty laugh* But of course... have fun you two...                                       Kai: *Breathing heavily* I’m... so relieved... you didn't leave yet, Nancy.                         Nancy: How's your car?                                                                              Kai: *Breathing heavily* Oh it’s fine, not a big deal... completely totaled, but I’m not going to   let that ruin my vibe. I guess someone set off a homemade explosive device right underneath it. It’s all good though, the tow truck hauled it away already. My horoscope said to not let things blow up today. I didn’t know it was referring to my car... But anyways, I need to ask you something! It must not wait any longer!                                                                               Nancy: Ah, I wanted to ask you something too...                                                     Kai: R-Really?! Go ahead!                                                                           Nancy: Well... you always say that you're both a physical and spiritual guide, right?               Kai: Of course!                                                                                     Nancy: Well, I was hoping you could give me some advice. Lately, I’ve been finding myself so        distracted by a little dilemma that I’m having. I almost feel as if it’s consuming me...            Kai: Dilemma, huh? Go on...                                                                         Nancy: Um... God, this is a little embarrassing... As you know, I've been single for a long time.   Kai: Uh-huh...                                                                                      Nancy: And I’ve always thought I was doing just fine on my own, but... T-There's this... man... that has really turned my life around. I don't know why, but every time I see him my heart starts       beating like crazy. I get butterflies in my stomach. I just... can't stop fantasizing about him...  He makes me feel so... alive! So young! So beautiful!                                               Kai: Oooh... Let me guess... He's from yoga class...?                                               Nancy: *Giggles* Perhaps...                                                                         Kai: Oh my god...                                                                                   Nancy: But the thing is... I can't be with him. It would be... weird. We’re not supposed to be      together... like that. And even if I tried to make a move, I don't know if he'd want to be with me. Kai: What? That's absurd! You're a goddess, Nancy! You’re a modern day Aphrodite!                   Nancy: But even if he wanted me too... and he felt the same way, what would other people think? What would my daughters think of me?                                                                    Kai: Your daughters? I've seen Dalia a couple of times in the fitness room. I know she would        definitely approve! She even waved at me once! Or at least... waved near me...                      Nancy: I don't know Kai... To be completely frank with you, I... I just get so horny whenever I     think of him. And whenever I’m around him! I can’t seem to control it!                              Kai: Oh god...                                                                                      Nancy: I'm scared I’ll lose control if I give myself to him. I've been holding back for too long... I have so much pent-up frustration. W-What if I turn into some sort of... insatiable nympho?        Kai: Yes...                                                                                         Nancy: *Giggles* Kinda like a volcano that hasn’t erupted for a long time, and it’s just about ready to burst... you know what I mean?                                                                  Kai: YES!!!                                                                                         Nancy: I mean... I’ve never felt this way before. What if I start asking him to do all these wild   things with me? Live out my craziest fantasies? What if I discover some weird kinks I didn't know I had?                                                                                                Kai: GOD YESSSS!!!!!!                                                                               Nancy: I don’t even think I would mind sharing him either. Just the thought of him having myself and someone else that’s close to me...                                                                 Kai: You mean like... a threesome with you and Dalia? Or a foursome with your other daughter too?!  Nancy: What!! N-No... *Giggles* Um, maybe. No... But, I mean... could you imagine?! I’m not sure    it’d ever come to that point, but...                                                                Kai: OH MY GOD NANCY, YES!!!! DEAR LORD, A HUNDRED TIMES YES!!!! You need to go for him. GET HIM    NOW!!                                                                                               Nancy: *Giggles* You really think I should do it?                                                   Kai: Absoooolutely! Nancy, sex is a beautiful part of life. If you have needs, you need to be taken care of. You deserve to be pampered... desired... lusted after. Even more so with you being such a  beautiful woman. Surrender to pleasure, Nancy. Succumb to your carnal desires!!                     Nancy: *Giggles* Yay! Okay! I think I’m actually going to do it! I’m not going to hold back anymore!Kai: Don’t you dare hold back! Fulfill all of your wildest fantasies! Life is too short!            Nancy: YES!! Okay! Agh, I can’t wait!! I'll tell you how it went next Saturday! Thank you so much,  Kai! You’re such a good friend! *Leaves*                                                            Kai: . . . . . . ? W-Wait a second... W-Was she not talking about m-me...?                          Raul: You ever think about going back to engineering, Mr. Kai?                                      Kai: . . .                                                                                          Nancy: (Man, I feel so... ALIVE!! Am I really gonna do it?!) *Giggles* (It feels like I’m 16 again! Although... how would I even approach him...? I can't just barge in and be like, "Hi Orion, did you know you make me feel so horny all the time? Do you wanna fuck your old babysitter?" Even if,       somehow, he wanted me too... and we ended up... doing it, Dalia and Penny would be furious if they  ever found out. No, they can’t find out. We'd have to keep it a secret... Our dirty little secret.  Which is also kind of exciting, I’m not gonna lie... What should I do? Think, Nancy, think... Hmm... Maybe I could try to play that game... Eternum. He spends a lot of time playing it. And I've heard you can do anything there. And that it feels exactly like real life. Oh god, I'm getting horny again just thinking about it... all the things we could do together... I need him to fuck me so hard...  ever since I saw his dick, I can’t keep it off my mind. Hmmm... And Eternum would be the perfect    place to avoid getting caught, too. But it's so expensive! I don't have an extra $3500 lying around. I know my job pays well, but with Dalia and Penelope's tuition costs, I’ve barely set aside        anything else. I'll have to come up with something. There’s gotta be a way... It sure isn’t easy    being a single mom.)                                                                                Gertrude: Nan?! *Hearty laugh* You’re gonna get all wrinkly if you stay in there any longer!        Nancy: Yeah, I'm coming out! Sorry, I got a little lost in my thoughts...                           Gertrude: Our table is booked for 1:40.                                                             Nancy: Ah, okay. I just need to blow dry my hair. (Hmph. I just can't justify spending $3500 on that neural implant.)                                                                                   Gertrude: You're gonna love this place, Nan.                                                        Nancy: (If it was cheaper then I would get it right away! But at that price? No...)                 Gertrude: They have these hamburger patties made of celery and blended tofu that are sooo good. It  almost tastes like chicken if you add their bok-bok chicken sauce.                                  Nancy: (I mean, what if Dalia or Penny got sick and I couldn't afford the medical bills?)           Gertrude: I used to go to another restaurant, but then one day they served me raw artichoke. Can you believe it?                                                                                        Nancy: (I could never forgive myself for that. I should really start building up an emergency fund.)Gertrude: They told me it was cooked enough, so then I stood up and said, “EXCUSE ME?! Do you even  know who I am?”                                                                                     Nancy: (I guess I'll have to find another way to get closer to Orion.)                              Gertrude: I'm the president of the Kredon School PTA! I have the power to do it all! I can get your son a scholarship, or I can get him expelled!                                                       Nancy: (Which is a shame, to be honest. Eternum looks amazing! I've been wanting to try it for so   long.)                                                                                              Gertrude: *Hearty laugh* Enjoy your 1-star review and your underpaid job, kid! I bet you went to    public school too, you illiterate buffoon!                                                          Nancy: (I bet if I tried to do anything at home, Dalia or Penny would surely notice.)               Gertrude: After that, I went home all angry. Then my husband tried to win me over with some little  gizmos he ordered us as a gift. It’s one of those game-thingamabobs that everyone plays on now.     Nancy: (God, that would be so embarrassing.)                                                        Gertrude: At first I was mad, I was like, “Why’d you buy me one of those kiddy thingamajigs?! You   think the PTA president has time for such nonsense?!” But then he explained afterward how it could  be good for our relationship. So I guess I'll try it once it’s delivered tomorrow. I think it’s     called an Ethereum implant.                                                                         Nancy: Wait, a w-what?                                                                              Gertrude: Am I saying it wrong? Eternimum?                                                          Nancy: Oh! Eternum? That's so cool! I was just thinking about that game too. Your son will love it. Gertrude: My son? No, no, he already has his own. This one is for me.                               Nancy: You? At our age? Oh well, I guess it is for all ages, but...                                 Gertrude: But? W-What's the problem?                                                                Nancy: Nothing! It's fine. It's just that, umm... Was it your husband's idea to play?               Gertrude: Yes, it was.                                                                              Nancy: Oh no... Just as I feared.                                                                   Gertrude: What's wrong?! Tell me, Nan!                                                              Nancy: It’s that... Well, I would hate for the same thing to happen to you...                       Gertrude: Thing? What thing?!                                                                       Nancy: Do you know Mindy? Randy's mother?                                                           Gertrude: No, doesn't ring a bell. Must not be in the PTA...                                        Nancy: Well, it turns out that Mindy bought neural implants for herself and her husband a few weeks ago, too. Everything was great at the beginning, but then she discovered the ugly truth: her husband had fallen in love with a woman 20 years younger than her! Someone he met while playing!           Gertrude: Oh heavens, no!                                                                           Nancy: Yeah... and then he ended up leaving her and their three kids to run off with that girl. I've heard Eternum is full of gold diggers, just waiting to pounce on vulnerable husbands that are      exhausted from the mundane routine of their normal life.                                            Gertrude: Oh my god! That's terrible! Do you think that my Richie could ever do something like that?Nancy: I don't know, Gerty... I don't know... But... between you and me, if I were in your shoes, I simply wouldn't risk it.                                                                            Gertrude: You’re right! I can’t chance it! But what can I do now?! The company doesn't offer        refunds!                                                                                            Nancy: And it's almost impossible to sell them, even if you say it’s unused. People are worried     about getting an implant that’s been illegitimately modified or hacked if they buy it second-hand. I think your best bet would be just to give it to someone you know.                                  Gertrude: But who? Who would buy it from me?                                                        Nancy: *Sighs* I don't know. I hate seeing you in a situation like this, Gerty. But you know what? I guess I can take it off your hands. I can’t just stand by and do nothing while you try to save your relationship. I'll even give you $100 for it.                                                      Gertrude: $100? B-But... But that thing cost us $3500, Nan! It'd be a shame to lose all that money  just like that!                                                                                     Nancy: Do you know what else would be a shame to lose? And would ultimately cost you even more      money? Your marriage.                                                                               Gertrude: OH MY GOD. YOU’RE RIGHT!!! I have to save my marriage. Do you know how that would make me look? Being the PTA president as a single mother?! UGH!! Oh... I mean... not that there’s anything  wrong with being a single mother, of course, but... Just take that cursed machine away from my      family! Please!                                                                                     Nancy: What would be a good time to meet up tomorrow?                                               Orion: Hey Nancy! Um... look, I'm really sorry, but I have to get going.                            Nancy: What? Why? What happened?                                                                    Orion: Nothing! It's just that... I should really grab a quick bite before meeting with my friend to work on a school project.                                                                          Nancy: Oh... it’s okay... I'm sorry... you probably got bored, huh. I know that you must be used to participating in more fast-paced activities...                                                      Orion: That’s not true at all! Seriously, I loved the class. It's just that... I'm in a bit of a    hurry and don’t want to be late.                                                                    Nancy: Uhm... well alright then. I guess I’ll see you at home. Take care, Orion.                    Orion: Sure! Bye, Nancy.                                                                            Nancy: . . .                                                                                        Orion: (Alright, I think this is the place where I'm supposed to meet Alex. I mean... Alexandra.    Don't wanna screw that up again... Damn! There must be something in the water here in Kredon...     these women are gorgeous... I need to convince Penelope to bring me with her to the next college    party. That’ll be one adventure that I definitely won’t want to miss!) *Taking a deep breath* (I    wonder what Nancy was about to say before Gertrude interrupted us. I don’t know if it was just me,  but I definitely felt some... sexual tension? Could that be possible?) Hmm... (I wonder if Nancy    agreed to go on a date with Kai... Well, whatever she decided, I shouldn’t think much about it. It’s none of my business. I did what I thought was best. Besides, I have enough of my own stuff to worry about...)                                                                                          Neighbor: WHAT THE FUCK! WATCH THE ROAD YOU OBLIVIOUS PIRATE!                                       Nova: S-Sorry!                                                                                      Orion: (Not a cloud in the sky since yesterday. Definitely a welcome change!)                       Nova: Orion!!!                                                                                      Orion: W-Wha—whoa!! Argh... my head...                                                              Nova: *Giggles* Oops... Sorry!                                                                      Orion: N-Nova? Where the hell did you come from?! (Where in the world does this girl get all her    energy from?) Do you always appear out of nowhere like that?! You’re like a face pimple on date     night...                                                                                            Nova: What are you doing here anyway?                                                               Orion: I’m waiting for someone! What are YOU doing here?                                            Nova: I have some news for you!                                                                     Orion: News?                                                                                        Nova: Did you already forget? You hired me to investigate your little mystery!                      Orion: Oh... yeah, of course. *Standing up* Well, technically, I didn't hire you.                   Nova: Hire, recruit, ask a favor... call it what you want!                                          Orion: I prefer to think of us as a team. That's why I was hoping to have some way to reach you.    That way we could... Wait, how did you even find me?                                                Nova: Um... It was purely a coincidence...!                                                         Orion: Hmm... You're a terrible liar. You might have many talents... but lying is not one of them.  You’re bad at it. Tell me the truth.                                                                Nova: Um... Well, I might have tapped into the GPS service on your phone...                         Orion: WHAT?!                                                                                       Nova: But I just did it to find you, in case I needed to tell you something important... It's not   even that accurate anyways... I find it’s usually off by about 50 or 60 feet...                     Orion: 50 feet?! I could easily throw a football that far!                                          Nova: Well...                                                                                       Orion: Wait a minute... I thought you said you only hack people that interest you...                Nova: W-We're getting off track here. So guess what! I was able to hack into Kredon's Police        Department storage database!                                                                        Orion: Damn! Really?                                                                                Nova: Hell yeah!                                                                                    Orion: That’s badass! Totally illegal, but badass! What did you find out?                           Nova: *Whispering* Okay, this is where things get a little more serious. We should lower our voices.Orion: *Whispering* Got it.                                                                         Nova: You were right. The police files regarding Benjamin’s death were definitely modified.         Orion: I knew it!                                                                                   Nova: The forensic report that was filed doesn't match the public information at all. He wasn't     found dead in his garage... he died of an aneurysm while playing Eternum! His estimated time of     death was right after you saw him playing the game! That leads me to believe... That somehow...     Orion: The Praetorian that excommunicated him in the game caused his death in the real world too.   Nova: Exactly.                                                                                      Orion: Have there been any other reports of real-world deaths while playing Eternum?                Nova: Not that I've seen.                                                                           Orion: And what about his family? Why aren’t they going public with this information? There are a   lot of organizations that are opposed to the way Eternum operates. A story like this would be       headline news!                                                                                      Nova: Ah! Now comes the ugly part. I took a peek at the bank account of Benjamin's parents and saw  they received a transfer of $750,000... one day after Benjamin died.                                Orion: What? Do you think that...                                                                   Nova: Ulysses paid for their silence. I knew they were hiding something! That means they could’ve   totally done this before... Excommunicating people in the game and causing their death in real      life... then bribing the families and the press for their silence.                                  Orion: Holy shit... This is all starting to sound like a conspiracy...                              Nova: There’s definitely a lot of merit to this one.                                                Orion: What do you suggest we do now?                                                               Nova: I'll keep digging. I think our best source of information is within Eternum itself... we just need to talk to the right people. If we become high-level players, or gain prestige by attaining a  Weapon of Atlas or a Gem of Doom... we might get invited to one of those high-class dinners. If     those dinners happen to be attended by some Ulysses big shots, I can try to download all their      private information.                                                                                Orion: (Hmm... I shouldn't tell her about the Gem we found in The Red Herring... not yet, at least.) Alright, that sounds like a solid plan to me.                                                      Nova: Yep! Okay, we probably shouldn’t talk about this in public anymore. I'll give you my phone    number in case you need to reach me.                                                                Orion: Well, well, well! So you do have a cell phone!                                               Nova: It's a burner phone, obviously. Secure line.                                                  Orion: Good, gotta make sure you’re not losing your edge!                                           Nova: Well...? I’m waiting... Aren't you gonna say something?                                       Orion: Alright, alright... I gotta say... Hacking both the police department and the bank account of Benjamin’s parents... all in just one day? You’re the real deal!                                   Nova: And don’t forget about those forensic files!                                                  Orion: Yes, and the forensic files. (She seems so eager for praise. I guess that’s to be expected.  The necessity of anonymity in her activities means she can’t really talk about her accomplishments  with anybody. I don’t know shit about hacking, but I know that stuff she did couldn’t have been     easy... I'm sincerely impressed.)                                                                   Pat her head                                                                                        Orion: Nice job, Nova! I really am impressed! You did things I thought were only possible in movies. The way you hacked into that mainframe, firewalled those... viruses, and umm, IP’d those           addresses...                                                                                        Nova: . . .                                                                                         Orion: You're such a good girl! You deserve a cookie, and not the web browser kind!                 Nova: H-Hey, don't overdo it! I'm not a damn puppy!                                                 Orion: *Laughs* I thought you needed to be buttered up!                                             Nova: W-Well, thank you for the compliments, but I’m not a child!                                   Orion: *Laughs* You liked the head pats though, admit it...                                         Nova: *Huffing* Hmph.                                                                               Just compliment her                                                                                 Orion: Nice job, Nova! Oh, damn! Alex...andra? Wow, I didn't know you ride!                         Alex: Yeah, well, we’ve only seen each other once before so... It would have surprised me if you    knew.                                                                                               Orion: Yeah, fair point. Always so logical.                                                         Alex: Who's your friend?                                                                            Nova: Nova. Nice to meet you.                                                                       Alex: Alexandra.                                                                                    Orion: This bike looks so cool! I want to learn how to ride!                                        Nova: Yeah, it looks pretty badass. I wasn't expecting Orion to be meeting up with a girl. Are you  two... a couple?                                                                                    Orion: W-What?                                                                                      Alex: *Laughs* He wishes!                                                                           Orion: Yeah, I wish she’d stop fangirling over me! It’s exhausting!                                 Alex: Yeah, sure... keep dreaming, dummy.                                                           Nova: Sorry for asking, it's just that I thought he was waiting for Chang or Annie. I didn't know   Orion had more friends.                                                                             Alex: Nah, I wouldn't even say that. Our teacher was the one who paired us up.                      Orion: Yeah, we have to do a project about... Hold up a second, how the fuck do you know who Chang  and Annie are?                                                                                      Nova: ...Hmm? Who?                                                                                  Orion: Chang and Annie! You just said their names!                                                  Nova: H-Huh, what? No I didn’t!                                                                     Orion: Yes, you did! Stop lying! I told you, you’re terrible at it!                                 Nova: Ohhh... yeah, well, you mentioned them the other day. Don’t you remember?                     Orion: That's not true!                                                                             Nova: Er... I meant to say that I saw the three of you the other day when...                        Orion: That's not true either! Oh my god, you're a compulsive liar!                                 Nova: Erm...                                                                                        Orion: Did you hack me?! OH GOD, YOU DID HACK ME!                                                   Nova: Oh shit, well would you look at the time!!                                                    Orion: What did you see?!                                                                           Nova: Gotta go!                                                                                     Orion: Wait!                                                                                        Nova: Call me if you find anything interesting...!                                                  Orion: NOVA!!!!                                                                                     Alex: *Laughs* I think I like that girl.                                                            Orion: Did you see that?! She totally hacked me! After I specifically asked her not to!             Alex: Got some juicy pics on your phone, Orion?                                                     Orion: Um... N-No, of course not...                                                                 Alex: Embarrassing browser history, perhaps?                                                        Orion: N-No... (Oh shit...)                                                                         Alex: Then stop crying! Let’s go, we're late. Get on.                                               Orion: On the bike? With you?                                                                       Alex: Are you scared?                                                                               Orion: Me? Hah! Fearless is my middle name.                                                         Alex: *Chuckles* That's the spirit. Alright, here we are. No need to be afraid anymore.             Orion: What are you talking about? I wasn't scared.                                                 Alex: I don't know about that... you were holding on to me awfully tight. I think I even heard you  whimper.                                                                                            Orion: You were going 60 down a residential street!!                                                Alex: Relaaax, it’s okay, I won’t judge you for being freaked out.                                  Orion: *Laughs* Oh screw you! *Getting off the bike* Holy shit, is that a Lambo?                    Alex: Hmm? Ah, yes. Two, actually.                                                                  Orion: (Damn, Alex's neighbors must be rich as fuck. I wonder if her family is well off, too. This  is a pretty wealthy-looking neighborhood, so it's very possible. There are even security cameras all throughout this parking garage. I don’t blame ‘em. I’d want surveillance too if I owned cars like  that.)                                                                                              Alex: Saying hello to the guards?                                                                   Orion: Sorry, I was lost in thought. It's just, I'm not used to seeing all this security. I'm the   type of guy who will leave his bike padlocked to a tree, if you know what I mean. Those cars are    awesome, though.                                                                                    Alex: Meh, I'm not a car person. They just look like a waste of money to me, to be honest. Do people actually like these gaudy things? I feel like most buy them only as a status symbol. They just want people to assume they're sooooo successful... But hey, if it helps your fragile ego and you have a lot of cash to burn, knock yourself out... Anyways, step back. I'm gonna park over there.           Orion: Oh, sure, sorry. I noticed all these parking spots are numbered... Does that mean A2 is your apartment?                                                                                          Alex: Not really, these numbers don't mean shit. Although the staff usually parks on the right side, where there's open space.                                                                          Orion: Oh... I see. I guess it makes sense. Are your neighbors pretty friendly?                     Alex: What neighbors? It’s just my family that lives here. Well... I guess only half of my family   now.                                                                                                Orion: Okay let me just pause here for a second... This entire garage... is yours?                  Alex: Of course.                                                                                    Orion: And... t-those supercars are... yours as well?                                               Alex: Well, technically they’re my father’s... Those are the newest additions though. I don’t know  why he even got them... he has dozens more just like them at our Upper Quarter house.               Orion: Holy shit! Is your father Jeff Bezos or something?!                                          Alex: Look, cut the shit. I’ve had enough people that’ve tried to milk a fake-friendship with me.   You aren’t going to get anything out of this. My father has disowned me and my mother doesn’t speak to me, so it’s not like I even have much to give. So you can finish your little charade.            Orion: What charade?? I don’t have a fucking clue who your father is!                               Alex: ...Are you serious?                                                                           Orion: I swear! So you... You really are the daughter of Jeff Bezos! That’s fucking PRIME!          Alex: . . . My father is William Bardot.                                                            Orion: . . .                                                                                        Alex: . . .                                                                                         Orion: The W-William Bardot? The largest shareholder of Ulysses and number 6 on the Forbes          Billionaire List?                                                                                   Alex: Mm-hm.                                                                                        Orion: Y-You're Alexandra Bardot?                                                                   Alex: Duh.                                                                                          Orion: . . . ...Axel is your brother?!                                                              Alex: My twin brother.                                                                              Orion: Oh my god, I need to sit down... This is... Holy shit! Why didn't anyone tell me?!           Alex: Are you serious? You didn’t know already?                                                     Orion: I had no idea!                                                                               Alex: Then why did you approach me the other day? Complimenting my... pen or whatever.              Orion: I don't know, I was just trying to be nice! That’s what normal people do, you know?!         Alex: Well, whether you knew about my family or not, you’re still not getting anything out of this. Like I said, my family doesn’t really give a shit about me.                                         Orion: Yeah, well that makes two of us. I’m not exactly on the best of terms with the Bardot family either.                                                                                             Alex: You already met Axel?                                                                         Orion: Yeah, uh... We've had a few encounters with each other... and let’s just say we don’t quite  get along. We had a little... run-in yesterday.                                                     Alex: Wait a second... Are you the one who punched him? He returned to class yesterday with a bloody nose. That was you?                                                                                Orion: I had no idea he was your brother, Alexandra. I'm so sorry.                                  Alex: *Laughs* No fuckin’ way. Nice work, Orion.                                                    Orion: R-Really?                                                                                    Alex: Most people are too scared of our damn last name to even think about standing up to him. I    thought you were just another one of those sheep. I guess you really can't judge a book by its      cover. You're a legit badass! So why did you hit him?                                               Orion: We got into an argument because of Benjamin's sudden death. And on the first day of school, I saw him harassing a close friend of mine. Honestly, I couldn't help it.                            Alex: Well, I think I respect you a little bit more now because of what you did. Well, I think I    respect you a little bit more now because of it. He's a fucking moron.                              Orion: Thank god I’m not the only one who sees that!                                                Alex: Come on, let's go up and start this project before our clothes start to smell like exhaust    fumes.                                                                                              Orion: Lead the way!                                                                                Alex: Okay, well, make yourself comfortable.                                                        Orion: Sure!                                                                                        Alex: My mother isn’t home, so don't worry about her.                                               Orion: You have a really nice place here, Alexandra.                                                Alex: Meh, if it were up to me, I’d decorate it very differently. If you want, you can take off your shoes. Just leave them by the doorway. Do you want something to drink?                             Orion: Nah, I'm good, thank you. Are you expecting guests?                                          Alex: Because of the dining table? Nah, it’s always set like that. Our housekeepers treat this place like a museum. Everything is always positioned perfectly and there’s never a speck of dust         anywhere.                                                                                           Orion: That sounds nice.                                                                            Alex: It makes me sick.                                                                             Orion: Err—Y-Yeah, that's w-what I meant to say.                                                    Alex: Come on, grab a seat on the couch.                                                            Orion: (This house looks awesome. Everything is so fancy and expensive.)                            Alex: *Sitting down* Alright, let's get started.                                                    Orion: (And then there's Alex. She just seems so out of her element.)                               Alex: *Looking at the clock* It's still early. My mother doesn't come back until dark, so we have   plenty of time.                                                                                     Orion: (She clearly doesn't belong here.) So just you and your mother live here?                    Alex: I’m not giving you my life story. Let’s just get this project over with already.              Orion: Come on! How can we work well together if we don’t even know each other?                     Alex: I prefer knowing nothing about you. It keeps things simple.                                   Orion: Well, you might feel that way, but I like knowing about who I’m working with!                Alex: *Sighs* I don't like talking about myself. And we're not even friends, so who gives a shit.   We’re just here to do a stupid project about social control. And besides, what the fuck do you want to know? My life is a snooze-fest.                                                                  Orion: Come on, don't say that! There’s something about you that I find, I don’t know... intriguing. Like that pink toenail polish. Someone must be hiding a sweet side underneath that tough           exterior...                                                                                         Alex: I only u-used that color because I ran out of black!                                          Orion: *Laughs* Sure, sure...                                                                       Alex: You know what? You wanna play that game? Alright, I’ll bite. You can ask your questions or    whatever. Pour your heart out, for all I care. But every time you do, you gotta do an extra 25% of  the project. Deal?                                                                                  Orion: Okay, sounds good to me.                                                                     Alex: What! You're supposed to say no.                                                              Orion: Too bad, I agreed to your terms. Can’t back out now!                                         Alex: Are you serious?                                                                              Orion: Completely.                                                                                  Alex: You’re a bigger dummy than I thought. Whatever... less work I have to do. Go ahead then. I    still don't get why you’re so interested. I already told you earlier that my family disowned me.    That’s already more than you needed to know. You would’ve gotten more enjoyment from gargling Axel's balls.                                                                                             Orion: Look, I don't know if you've had a bad experience opening up to someone before, but I promise my curiosity is genuine. I don't give a shit about your family, or how much money and influence    they have. I didn't even know you were a Bardot until today. I only asked about you because I       honestly think you're fascinating. I’ve been intrigued since the moment I first saw you. I like your style, and enjoy your snark and wit. I just want to get to know the real Alexandra. And I’m not    sorry for it.                                                                                       Alex: . . .                                                                                         Orion: And... are you blushing?                                                                     Alex: W-What? Of course not.                                                                        Orion: *Chuckles* Yeah, I think you are.                                                            Alex: I'm not.                                                                                      Orion: I don't know, unless you just magically applied some makeup to your cheeks, I'm pretty sure I just witnessed some blushing. Maybe I am getting a little closer to Miss Alexandra’s soft side...  Alex: S-Shut the fuck up! I said I wasn’t blushing! Ok, enough of this bullshit! We’ve wasted enough time already.                                                                                      Orion: You know, I asked 4 questions, so... now I have to do 100% of the work. A deal is a deal.    Alex: Shut up. I was kidding. Let’s just get this over with.                                        Orion: Ah, so there is a kind heart in there after all!                                             Alex: I told you to shut up. And it’s not even like that. I just don’t want to get an F because of  your shitty work.                                                                                   Orion: *Laughs* Fair enough. Have you come up with any ideas on what we could write about?          Family                                                                                              Orion: So... tell me about your family.                                                             Alex: Ahhh... I knew this one was coming. Well, the Bardot family... Where should I begin... My     mother Priscilla has never had to lift a finger in her life. She married at 20 and got knocked up   right away to have that easy, stay-at-home mom life. She wasn’t even much of a mother because our   nannies did all the work. She’s never shown even the slightest care toward us. The only things I    recall from my childhood are seeing her constantly coming home drunk, and arguing with father       because of his repeated infidelity. Then, of course, there's my father... William Bardot himself!   The Patriarch! The big man! Mr. Money Bags! He only cares about money, power, and status. He’s an   egotistic manipulator at his core, who won’t hesitate to crush whoever or whatever gets in his way. Last but certainly not least, there’s my sweet, darling of a brother... my beloved twin Axel. He's  like a clone of father. Simply a spoiled rotten psychopath who believes our last name allows him to do whatever he wants, without any consequence... ...which you seem to have noticed already. We’re   not exactly the picture-perfect Brady Bunch family, as you can tell.                                Orion: Damn, I'm sorry to hear that, Alexandra. It probably doesn’t mean much, but I can sort of    understand where you’re coming from. I never met my mother and my father was always absent in my    life. He was constantly too occupied with his work. I know what it's like to be alone.              Alex: Huh... I just assumed you were one of those pampered city boys that’s never known a hard day  in his life... Thanks, but I’m not seeking anyone’s sympathy. I learned to fend for myself long     ago.                                                                                                Orion: (I think I’m starting to understand why she’s so guarded all the time...)                    Hobbies                                                                                             Orion: So tell me, what do you do for fun?                                                          Alex: Well, I love swimming. I swim every day. As soon as I’m in the water, it’s like I forget about everything else. Stress, worries, problems... they all just fade away. It’s where I really find    peace. And I also like to play Eternum.                                                             Orion: Oh, you’re an Eternumite too?!                                                               Alex: Of course, who isn’t nowadays? With my father being who he is, it’d be more weird if I wasn’t. To be honest, I almost stopped playing a few years ago out of spite. But really... having a game   where you can escape reality and live in a new one? Yeah, I'll take it, thanks.                     Orion: I recently became an Eternumite myself! Maybe we can play together sometime.                 Alex: Um, I don't know... I’ve been very busy lately. Between school, swimming, and working at the  cafe, I barely have any free time.                                                                  Orion: Wait... you said you work at a cafe? But... aren't you rich?                                 Alex: Ugh, I don't want any of my father's money. Fuck him and fuck his dirty money. He thinks he   can use that to control me, but I'm not Axel. I haven't taken a single dollar from him since I was  16.                                                                                                 Orion: So the motorcycle...                                                                         Alex: Paid for with MY money. And soon I’m going to leave this place too, once I have enough saved  up. I can't stand being under his roof.                                                             Orion: Damn... I don't know if I'd ever have the courage to do that. That says a lot about you.     Religion                                                                                            Orion: Are you religious?                                                                           Alex: Who, me? Nah.                                                                                 Orion: Oh, I just noticed your cross necklace and it had me wondering.                              Alex: Yeah, I assumed so. My grandmother gave it to me for my birthday. She was very devout. But I'm not, and never was. Our family went to Mass a few times when I was a kid, but it just wasn't my    thing. I don't know if there's life after death, but if that were the case... I doubt that simply   attending church on Sundays determines whether a person deserves to go to heaven or hell.           Orion: So the cross must have some sort of other significance to you, then?                         Alex: Um... Significance...? No... not at all. You’re reaching with that one. I... just wear it     because it looks cool. Plain and simple.                                                            Orion: Oh, okay. That’s a valid reason then.                                                        Tattoos                                                                                             Orion: I know you don't enjoy compliments, but I really like your tattoos. How many do you have?    Alex: Quite a lot. Some are a lot older than others. This was the first one I got... I remember my  father getting so pissed off about it. So I went back to the tattoo parlor a week later and got this other one. And this one here is from my trip to Mexico 3 years ago. As much as I love my tattoos, I don't think I'm gonna get any more. You have to know when to stop.                                 Orion: You also have a few leg tattoos, right? I remember seeing them during swim class. Do you have tattoos in any other places?                                                                       Alex: *Chuckles* Nice try, this isn’t a strip club. I’m not giving you a free show.                 Orion: *Chuckles* I was just asking...                                                              Alex: What about you? Any tattoos?                                                                  Orion: Not yet. But if I had any, I’d definitely show them to you.                                  Alex: Even if you had one on, like... your ass??                                                    Orion: Especially if it was on my ass! But hey, I understand that you’re more embarrassed about that kind of stuff. No worries. I just have a lot of confidence in my body...                           Alex: Huh. You think I’m ashamed of my body or something? Too scared to show off my other tattoos? I promise you, I’m not.                                                                              Orion: I didn’t say that.                                                                           Alex: *Huffing* Hmph.                                                                               Orion: I just know that not everyone... (Oh boy... HOT DAMN. That is one beautiful sight!)          Alex: There’s this one on my left cheek, but it’s kind of faded away with time.                     Orion: Uh-huh...                                                                                    Alex: Since I spend so much time swimming, the ink fades a bit faster due to all that chlorine... or salt, if I’m in the ocean.                                                                         Orion: Y-Yeah, yeah, makes sense. (Did she get that ass just from swimming? Holy shit...)           Alex: Then I have these two over here.                                                              Orion: (Oh my god, now I wanna know how far down that one goes...) V-Very nice.                     Alex: And finally, I have this one here on my left calf. Although it's pretty faded too. All that   swimming isn’t doing my ink any favors.                                                             Orion: Yeah, I suppose...                                                                           Alex: And that’s pretty much it. Hope you enjoyed the show.                                         Orion: It was very uhh... informative. You have a really nice bod—er, bunch of tattoos.             Alex: Unfortunately for you, I don’t have any tattoos on my chest. Maybe you would’ve gotten to see those too...                                                                                        Orion: Now that is a real tragedy. Maybe you should show me where you could get one...              Alex: Nice try.                                                                                     Let's get to work                                                                                   Orion: Alright, I think that’s enough extra work on my plate. Shall we?                             Alex: Finally! Okay, let’s get this thing going...                                                  Orion: Alright, where should we start?                                                              Alex: I guess we should decide on a topic. Then we can divide the tasks.                            Orion: Have you come up with any ideas on what we could write about?                                Alex: Actually, yes. I liked your idea of investigating a cult.                                     Orion: Nice! That one interested me the most, too.                                                  Alex: Have you heard about a sect in the Netherlands that sacrifices humans to an ancient demon     called Calaadia? They’re doing this shit now! Like in the 21st century!                             Orion: What the hell! How have I never heard of this?! Tell me everything you know about it!        Alex: *Chuckles* Apparently, they operate in...                                                     Orion: That's what I call making good use of time! We managed to get a lot done!                    Alex: Yeah, I hate to admit it, but I guess there’s not just a bunch of empty space in that skull of yours. You’re not that dumb after all.                                                             Orion: We’ll definitely get an A!                                                                   Alex: Maybe.                                                                                        Orion: Well, since we managed to finish everything in one day, I wanted to ask you... You wanna play Eternum together? Let’s say... tomorrow morning? You’ve got all this spare time now!               Alex: With a noob like you? Nah, hard pass.                                                         Orion: Come on, I can actually be a valuable teammate! Dalia had her doubts about me too, but then I ended up saving her life... more or less.                                                          Alex: I'm swimming tomorrow morning. I can't.                                                       Orion: After lunch?                                                                                 Alex: Go hang out with Idriel or something... I don’t have the patience for noobs like you. I have  something more important to do. I've been after a special item in the game and I need to keep       hunting for it. I think I’m getting close.                                                          Orion: Ah, a Gem of Doom?!                                                                          Alex: Better.                                                                                       Orion: Better than a Gem of Doom? Tell me, tell me!                                                 Alex: Even if I told you what it was, it’d be of no value to you.                                   Orion: All the more reason to tell me then!                                                         Alex: You're persistent, huh?                                                                       Orion: You could say it’s one of my many strengths...                                               Alex: *Sighs* Have you heard about the Weapons of Atlas?                                            Orion: Yeah! Idriel told me about them. Hyas, Dione, and Calypso.                                   Alex: Well, I think I know where Calypso is.                                                        Orion: You’ve got to be kidding me! Holy shit! We have to go get it!                                Alex: That's the tricky part. You can't. Calypso is hidden somewhere on the Ogygia server. But      that’s pretty common knowledge for most veteran players.                                            Orion: Okay, so what’s stopping you or anyone else from retrieving it?                              Alex: That’s the thing. There's no gateway. No point of access. No one has an invitation to that    server. We can't get in.                                                                            Orion: So... all we have to do is “create” some sort of door to access that server?                 Alex: If it were that easy, someone would’ve done it already.                                       Orion: Hmm... Do you remember that crazy girl from earlier? The one with the eye patch? I think she might be able to help us with that.                                                                 Alex: You think just by telling her the server name, she’ll be able to come up with some special    spell to access it?                                                                                 Orion: It's... possible. Something like that. It's worth a try.                                     Alex: Alright then, help me find Calypso and then I’ll share it with you.                           Orion: Deal! By the way, do you know what kind of weapon is it?                                     Alex: No one knows for sure, but... rumor says it's some sort of code.                              Orion: A... code? Meh, I was hoping it was a lightsaber crossbow or something like that. What good  is a code to us?                                                                                    Alex: Think bigger. Imagine a code that allows you to manipulate servers, create new weapons, or    even change the laws of nature within any world of Eternum! It'd be the ultimate weapon!            Orion: Ok, that sounds good... but you don’t even know if that’s what it really is! What if it’s    just a coupon code for 3% off your next footlong at Subway?                                         Alex: Don't make me regret bringing you along...                                                    Orion: Okay, okay. Let me do my part. I'll call you tomorrow.                                       Alex: Sure. I'll be waiting... Aw, shit...                                                          Orion: Hmm?                                                                                         Alex: *Whispering* It's my mother... *Whispering* Please, don’t make a sound! Let’s just sneak down to the garage. *Whispering* I’m b-begging you!                                                      Orion: *Whispering* Of course... (She certainly sounds nervous...)                                  Priscilla Bardot: A-Alexandraaaa...?                                                                Orion: (Her mom seems a little drunk...)                                                            Priscilla Bardot: Lately it's becoming such a rarity to see you at home. Who's this... boy?         Alex: He’s nobody. We were just leaving. I’m not going to be home for dinner.                       Priscilla Bardot: Wait, your father is coming upstairs now. You don't want to give him a kiss?      Alex: W-What? Why is he here?                                                                       Priscilla Bardot: He came to sign the divorce papers, darling. He isn’t leaving us with anything,   you know? Not a single penny. I guess you can get away with whatever you want, if you have the      finest lawyers money can buy. He is leaving us this apartment, at least. He’ll be living in the big house with your brother. I... I told you all of this would happen, Alexandra. *Hic* This is all your fault...                                                                                           Alex: I... Come on Orion, let's leave before... *Clenching her fists*                               William Bardot: . . . On top of parading yourself with those disgusting tattoos, you decided to     start dressing like a fucking whore now, too?                                                       Alex: Get out of the way. I have to go.                                                             William Bardot: Hmm, where did I go wrong with you...? I gave you everything you wanted, provided   for all your needs, and now this is how you repay me? By humiliating me every day? Being an utter   disgrace to the family name?                                                                        Alex: I’ve been paying for everything myself.                                                       William Bardot: Oh, really? Are you paying for the rent? Your tuition? All of your meals? You really think you’d make enough money to survive by selling your filthy cunt on the street corner? You have no idea how the real world works, Alexandra.                                                       Alex: *Voice breaking* I’m working as a waitress.                                                   William Bardot: You’re pathetic. Why can't you be like Axel?                                        Alex: *Voice breaking* J-Just let me through the door...                                            William Bardot: You should have never been born.                                                    Alex: *Voice breaking* Please, let me...                                                            William Bardot: LOOK ME IN THE EYE WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU!                                         Keep quiet                                                                                          William Bardot: You ungrateful little brat.                                                         Alex: *Runs off*                                                                                    William Bardot: Your one job was to raise these children and you couldn't even do that, Priscilla.  Huh? And who the fuck are you? Are you one of my employees?                                         Orion: Um... I... I am... Uh...                                                                     Say something                                                                                       William Bardot: You ungrateful little brat.                                                         Orion: Don’t you dare speak to her like that!                                                       William Bardot: Hmm? Excuse me...? I know you aren’t talking to me like that.                       Orion: You've got to be the saddest excuse for a “father” that I’ve ever seen in my life. You're a  despicable human being. Now I see why Axel is such a jerk. Like father, like son.                   William Bardot: WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?! You’re going to regret the day you ran your foul mouth around me, you fucking imbecile. I’ll make damn sure you’re never able to find work again. What the hell is your name?!                                                                                Orion: I don’t work for you. I don’t have to tell you shit.                                         William Bardot: You clearly have no idea who you’re speaking to, so let me spell it out for your    simpleminded brain.                                                                                 Alex: *Runs off*                                                                                    Orion: I know exactly who you are and frankly I couldn’t care less.                                 William Bardot: What is your goddamn name?                                                          Orion: Time will put you in your place.                                                             William Bardot: I’ve had enough of you... I'm gonna...                                              Priscilla Bardot: Are we doing this or not, William?! *Hic* I thought you had business to attend to.William Bardot: . . . You're not even worth the trouble. Get the hell out of my sight.              Orion: (Asshole...) Alexandra?! (Fuck, she left... I guess she took her bike.) *Sighs* (Think it’d  be best if I just went home. I'll try to call her tomorrow after I've spoken with Nova about        Calypso. This isn’t how I wanted to end my Saturday, but oh well... what's done is done.) *Yawn*    (I'm really tired... Time to go.) Alexandra! Are you okay?! I know you told me to stay quiet, and   I'm really sorry... But I... I couldn't just stand there and watch how that moron...                Hug her back                                                                                        Orion: (I think it'd be best if I didn’t say anything. I can’t imagine how it feels to hear your own father say he wishes you were never born. I knew their relationship was bad, but I didn’t know it  was that bad...)                                                                                    Don't hug her back                                                                                  Orion: Are you alright?                                                                             Alex: *Clears throat* S-Sorry, I don't know what...                                                 Orion: (Damn, he left a good mark on her cheek.)                                                    Alex: I don’t know what came over me.                                                               Orion: It's okay, there’s nothing to apologize for. Look, I’m not trying to stick my nose into your business, but if you ever need help with anything, someone to talk to, or a place to stay...        Alex: Don't worry. It's not the first time something like this has happened. I’m used to it... I    just need to make it through the next four weeks. As soon as I receive my next paycheck, I’m leaving this damn place and never coming back. It’s a good thing you never told him your name. I’ve seen   him ruin so many lives for much less than what you did.                                             Orion: Can I help you with anything right now? Want me to get you some ice for your face...?        Alex: No, it's okay. You've done enough. You should leave now. Your house is pretty far and it's    getting late. I'll see you Monday.                                                                  Orion: Alright... Take care, Alexandra. If you ever need anything at all, please don’t hesitate to  call me. I’ll drop whatever I’m doing to be there for you, alright?                                 Alex: Alex.                                                                                         Orion: Huh?                                                                                         Alex: Call me Alex. My father calls me Alexandra. I hate it.                                        Orion: *Chuckles* Have I finally earned my place in your exclusive “cool club”?                     Alex: Don’t let it get to your head. I just think you’re... bearable.                               Orion: *Chuckles* Coming from you, that is quite the achievement. Guess I'll keep chipping away at  that tough exterior of yours...                                                                     Alex: *Laughs* Good luck with that. Thank you, Orion. For everything. I mean it. Goodbye, Orion.    Orion: *Sighs* (Think it’d be best if I just went home. I can't help feeling bad for her. I wish I  could help somehow. But there’s not much I can do right now. I'll try to call her tomorrow after    I've spoken with Nova about Calypso.) *Yawn* (I'm really tired... Let's go...)                      Alex: *Sighs* . . . And the winner is... Alex Bardot!!! Unbelievable! Another gold medal added to   the pile for Alex! She just became the top American swimmer of all time! Miss Bardot,               congratulations! Would you like to share any words for those young athletes trying to achieve your  levels of success? Well, I'd tell them to work hard every day and never give up on their dreams!    What wonderful advice! Congratulations again on your victory! Thank you, thank you! Who goes there?! Oh no! It's the wicked, medal-snatching witch! She's come to steal my prize! So we meet again!     You’re never gonna take it away from me! I’ve stopped you before and I'll stop you again, evil      villain!                                                                                            Alex's grandma: You won't be able to escape me this time, Alex! That medal will be mine!            Alex: Not if I use my freezing gun! One shot and you'll be frozen forever! Surrender now or else!   Alex's grandma: NEVER!!                                                                             Alex: You’ve given me no choice! BANG!                                                              Alex's grandma: Oh, no! I'm freezing! How could she have invented such an amazing weapon?!          Alex: *Giggles* Because I'm a genius!                                                               Alex's grandma: I guess I’ll just wrap my arms around this genius superhero before I freeze! That   way we'll be trapped together forever!                                                              Alex: *Laughs* Let me go! That's cheating!                                                          Alex's grandma: *Laughs* It’s too late! The ice is taking hold! Ahhh!!                              Alex: *Laughs*                                                                                      Alex's grandma: Look, honey... I’m afraid I have some bad news. Mommy and Daddy are going to be away for a little bit longer than planned. Your father is about to launch the big game he’s been working on for the past few years. So he has to stay in China for a couple more weeks.                     Alex: Whaaat? But tomorrow's my birthday!                                                           Alex's grandma: I know, sweetie... I’m sorry, but they won’t be able to make it this year.          Alex: But only Dad works on that game! Why can't Mommy be here?!                                    Alex's grandma: Because... She's... also busy.                                                      Alex: That's bullshit! She doesn't even have a job!                                                 Alex's grandma: Hey! What did I tell you about saying bad words?! No swearing! Who taught you those words?                                                                                              Alex: Sorryyyy... Well, that’s okay then. I don’t need Mom and Dad here! All I need is my Mee-Maw!  You’re gonna be with me forever!! Right?!                                                           Alex's grandma: Alex... I... You know what? How about I give you an early birthday present! My      cross!                                                                                              Alex: Your cross? Why? You never take it off.                                                       Alex's grandma: Well, today is a very special day. Because I want you to have it now!               Alex: But... I don't want it. It's not very pretty... and it’s so heavy!                            Alex's grandma: It's not about it being pretty, it's about the meaning behind it!                   Alex: And what does it mean?                                                                        Alex's grandma: Alex... there’s going to come a day where I... can’t be around anymore.             Alex: What?! Don't say that! Are you gonna leave me?                                                Alex's grandma: I never will. That's the thing! Even if I get sick and you can't visit me, or... I  have to go away for a while... I want you to look at this cross and think of me. Remember that I’ll always be there looking after you. That you’ll always have a part of me with you.                   Alex: But Mee-Maw...                                                                                Alex's grandma: And besides! You’re going to be going to school next year and you’ll be so busy     playing with all of your new friends!                                                               Alex: I don't need any friends. I don't like any of the other kids from school. I'm okay with being alone. And when I get tired of that, I have you!                                                    Alex's grandma: We all need other people to lean on, Alex. It's okay to admit we need help          sometimes. We can't do it all alone. I used to be just like you! I loved being alone and used to    think I was doing completely fine, until one day... I met your grandpa. And he changed my life. I'm sure one day you'll meet your prince too.                                                           Alex: My prince?                                                                                    Alex's grandma: *Laughs* Or your princess, who knows. But one day, you're going to meet that person who changes your life forever. When that time comes, you’re going to wonder how you ever lived      without them.                                                                                       Alex: Are you my princess?                                                                          Alex's grandma: *Laughs* No, I'm not. But remember Alex, I'll always be with you. If you ever have  your doubts, just look at that cross... ...And think of me.                                         Alex: Where will I find that person?                                                                Alex's grandma: Who knows. Maybe you’ll run into them tomorrow! Or at school. Or maybe 20 years from now! But whenever that time comes, you’ll know it in your heart, honey.                            Alex: My... My prince... Bullshit...                                                                Alex's grandma: I thought I told you to watch your language, young lady!                            Alex: (My prince...) Bullshit...                                                                    Orion: Hmmm... (Jeez, I passed out right away last night. Fuck, where the hell is the light switch? What... What's that sound? What the... Where the hell am I? Is that a road? Fuck, don't tell me I’ve been sleepwalking... I'd better go towards that light and see if I can get my bearings... This road seems to have no end. Am I even in Kredon anymore? If I see a car ahead, I should probably try     to...)                                                                                              Lady: Will you help us?                                                                             Orion: (Holy fuck! Where the hell did she come from?!) Miss! Do you know where we are? I’m not      really sure how I got here...                                                                       Lady: . . .                                                                                         Orion: (W-Why isn’t she answering?) Um, Miss?                                                       Lady: . . .                                                                                         Orion: (Ok, this is creeping me out.) Uh... I'm just gonna keep walking and see if...               *Hyperventilating* W-What the fuck is going on...                                                   Lady: Will you help us?                                                                             Orion: W-What?                                                                                      Lady: Will you help us?                                                                             Orion: Who are you?                                                                                 Lady: Will you help us?                                                                             Orion: H-Help you?                                                                                  Lady: Will you help us?                                                                             Yes                                                                                                 Orion: Y-Yes, um... I’ll try!                                                                       No                                                                                                  Orion: N-No! I don’t even know what’s going on!                                                     Lady: We need your help.                                                                            Orion: My help? B-But why me? I'm not anyone special!                                               Lady: . . . Special. Is anyone special?                                                             Orion: What?                                                                                        Lady: Wolves and sheep. Rich and poor. Emperors and peasants. Masters... and slaves. Kings... ...and pawns. When the game is over... they all go back into the same box.                                Orion: . . . But that’s the same with life, isn’t it? There comes a time for everyone. That's what  makes us human. There’s nothing we can do to stop it.                                               Lady: Ahh...                                                                                        Orion: F-Fuck!                                                                                      Lady: That's where you're wrong, Orion.                                                             Orion: W-What? AAAAAAARGHHH! FUCK! (Oh my fucking god, that was terrifying! I’ve never had a        nightmare like that before... I hardly ever dream in the first place... Well, at least it's over... Okay, time to pull myself together.) *Yawns* (It's still pretty early, but I might as well just get up now.) Ahhh... (Nothing like a nice cup of coffee on a cold, rainy morning. Penelope should be    waking up here soon. I'm pretty excited for our photoshoot together. I'm no expert, but with how    photogenic she is, it’s probably impossible to take a bad picture of her anyways. I have literally  nothing to do today. I could get used to this! Perfect Sunday! Oh, I should ask Nova about Calypso  and see if she’s heard of that server Alex told me about. Maybe she knows a way to get access to    it.)                                                                                                Call her                                                                                            Orion: (I hope she won’t get nervous if I call her so soon. I know she’s still trying to get used to having a phone. Let's see if she answers...)                                                       Nova: Orion!!! Orion!!! Good morning!                                                               Orion: Damn! You picked up fast!                                                                    Nova: Yeah! I just happened to be looking at my phone and then you called! I guess these things are more handy than I thought!                                                                          Orion: So you really haven’t had a cell phone at all, until now?                                    Nova: Yeah, I feel like I've been missing out on so much. I even downloaded a game yesterday and    ended up playing all night!                                                                         Orion: So you bought your first ever phone... all because of me??                                   Nova: I m-mean... I wouldn’t say that exactly, but umm... I guess... ...It was purely for the       investigation! Y-Yeah! That’s right.                                                                Orion: Uh-huh, the investigation, hmm...? Well aren't you worried about someone spying on you?      Through the phone?                                                                                  Nova: Of course not! I eliminated all of the attack vectors I could think of! It’s practically      hack-proof. Every call or message has end-to-end encryption and all my web traffic is tunneled      through a private VPN. It's the most secure line in the world! Anyway, what can I help you with, Mr. Orion?                                                                                             Orion: Well, I wanted to ask you something, and I thought a call would be a little more personal    than a text.                                                                                        Nova: Oh... W-Well, thank you! Seeing you calling was a pleasant surprise! I mean... I'm still in my pajamas and I haven't even done my hair yet. It’s so messy...                                      Orion: (Yeah, she definitely hasn’t received a phone call in her life. It's so cute.) You know I    can't see you, right?                                                                               Nova: Of course I know that, dummy! I'm not stupid! I meant that I just got up. I was whippin’ up   some waffles.                                                                                       Orion: Oh, that sounds delicious! I’m just enjoying my morning coffee. Is it raining over there too?Nova: Yeah, hasn’t stopped since midnight. Kredon isn’t really that big. If it’s raining on one side of town, it’s probably raining on the other too. Anyway, what did you want to ask me?              Orion: Ah, yeah, remember the girl who picked me up yesterday?                                      Nova: Yeah! The one with the badass crotch rocket!                                                  Orion: Turns out she knows the location for one of the Weapons of Atlas!                            Nova: What? Are you serious? Which one was it? Calypso? The server-shaper?                          Orion: Yeah, that one! I see you know about it already.                                             Nova: Of course! I know all about the three ultimate weapons. The sword Hyas, the sniper Dione, and finally, Calypso. I’ve been trying to get my hands on them for a long time.                         Orion: The Eternum Lady, Idriel, told me that Hyas was missing and Dione is already in the hands of a player. Delilah something...                                                                      Nova: Delilah Warren!! Have you heard about her? S-She's awesome, right?!                           Orion: I don’t know much about her. Do you know her?                                                Nova: Um... s-something like that. I'll introduce you to her sometime! Anyway, as I was saying,     Calypso is the most powerful weapon of the three. Nobody has been able to find it. No one knows     exactly what kind of weapon it is, but it’s rumored on some servers to be a sort of server-shaper.  Orion: Yeah, Alex said it's a code that allows you to create things in Eternum, or something like   that.                                                                                               Nova: A CREATION CODE! Of course! That would definitely make it the ultimate weapon in any game! It makes sense!                                                                                        Orion: The problem is that it's hidden in a server that we can't access. It's called... Ogygia. Do  you know of a way we could get in?                                                                  Nova: Accessing a server? Leave it to me!                                                           Orion: I knew I could count on you. My favorite hacker!                                             Nova: Just give me a few hours. I have a few exploits in mind that I want to try out. I'll call you back!                                                                                               Orion: Awesome! Oh, by the way, if you do manage to find a way in, we’ll have to bring Alex along.  She's the one who discovered its location, so she definitely deserves to come.                      Nova: Of course. The more the merrier... Anyway, I should get to work.                              Orion: Alright, thanks for all your help, Nova. I’ve really been putting you to work lately! And    don't worry, there's no rush. Take as much time as you need! If I can help out somehow, let me      know.                                                                                               Nova: Sure! Maybe we can grab a bite at Luna’s cafe sometime soon. We can talk about the last season of Jujutsu Kaisen. I also watched the last episode yesterday!                                      Orion: What do you mean, "also"? Did you hack my laptop again?                                      Nova: O-Of course not! I just assumed that... Well, it's a very popular show, and... W-What the...  is that smoke?                                                                                      Orion: What smoke?                                                                                  Nova: . . .                                                                                         Orion: W-What's that noise? Is that a fire alarm?                                                   Nova: OH, FUCK! MY WAFFLES!                                                                         Sandra: NOVA?!                                                                                      Nova's Dad: OH JESUS CHRIST, WHY IS THE KITCHEN ON FIRE?!                                           Nova: S-Sorry, I was making waffles, but then I received a phone call and...                        Nova's Dad: WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT! YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A CELL PHONE!!                 Nova: I d-do now! I...                                                                              Nova's Dad: HURRY UP AND GO BRING ME THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER!                                         Nova: Y-Yes!                                                                                        Nova's Dad: SANDRA, I NEED A BLANKET!                                                               Sandra: ON IT!                                                                                      Nova's Dad: OH MY GOD, WE JUST BOUGHT THAT FRIDGE!                                                  Nova: Erm...                                                                                        Nova's Dad: NOOOOO! NOT MY LUCKY OVEN MITTS!                                                        Nova: I'LL CALL YOU LATER! SEE YA!                                                                  Orion: (Jesus, I hope they're alright.) *Laughs* (That girl is definitely something else. Never a   dull moment with her.)                                                                              Send her a message                                                                                  Orion: (I don’t want to make her nervous if I call. I know she still isn’t used to having a phone.  I'll just text her.) *Typing* Hi Nova! Sorry to bother you, but my friend Alex just told me about a server that might be hiding a Weapon of Atlas... Calypso. Do you know anything about that?          Nova: Orion! So glad you texted me!  Yeah, of course I do!                                          Orion: *Typing* The thing is, we don’t know much else about it. So I thought maybe you could help us with your... "hacking" abilities.                                                                  Nova: For a Weapon of Atlas? Hell yeah! I can do some investigating. Do you know what the server is called?                                                                                             Orion: *Typing* Ogygia. But Alex said there's no way to access it.                                  Nova: Leave it to me! I have plenty of Eternum exploits that I can try. Give me a few hours.        Orion: *Typing* OK!! Thanks, Nova!                                                                  Nova: I'll call you later!                                                                          Orion: (That went well. I thought she'd be much more paranoid about using a phone. She must’ve      configured hers to be extra secure.)                                                                Penelope: Good morning, Orion!                                                                      Orion: (Guess I'll finish my coffee and then go watch a show while I wait for Nova's call. I really want to play Eternum, but I’d rather just wait to play with one of the girls. I don't wanna join the wrong server and end up dying in a fight, or something.) Penny! Good morning! Whoa, I love your    hair today! And your outfit!                                                                        Penelope: Thank you! I'm glad you like it. All that humidity outside better not turn my hair into a frizzy mess, though! Hope you didn’t forget our photoshoot today!                                   Orion: Of course not! Do you think I got all dolled up for nothing?                                 Penelope: *Giggles* Yeah, true, I noticed your stylish jersey. I'm not sure about your hair, though. If you were going for the bedhead look, you definitely achieved it.                                Orion: My hair is a wild beast that cannot be tamed.                                                Penelope: I'll take you to my hairdresser one day. He's a good friend of mine.                      Orion: *Laughs* No, thanks! Is he the same guy who was gonna be your photographer today, instead of me?                                                                                                 Penelope: No, that's Philippe, who you’ll get to meet at the studio later. He works there.          Orion: Ah, cool. Do you know him just from the studio? Or do you guys go to college together?       Penelope: I first met him during a photo shoot last year. He's actually my boyfriend.               Orion: I see. W-Wait... I'm sorry, he’s w-what?                                                     Penelope: My boyfriend.                                                                             Orion: Y-You have a boyfriend?                                                                      Penelope: Is that a hint of jealousy, I’m sensing?                                                  Orion: N-No... I mean... it's just that... the other night at the cafe, you mentioned you were      single.                                                                                             Penelope: I lied. I like to keep my private life... private.                                        Orion: Oh... And uh... This Philippe...                                                             Penelope: You’ll meet him soon enough. Then you can ask him all the questions you want. Shall we?   Orion: Sure... l-let's go.                                                                          Penelope: Alright, this is the studio. Maybe we're too early...                                     Orion: (Man, I can't believe she has a boyfriend. I mean... not that I care... or even had any      chance, but still...)                                                                               Penelope: This studio is my absolute favorite. The equipment they use here is of the highest        quality!                                                                                            Orion: Mm-hm... (Of course she has a boyfriend. Have you even seen the way she looks, Orion?)       Penelope: I was only able to get a half-hour time slot. Every other time was fully booked.          Orion: Uh-huh... (It's not like I was expecting her to wait for me like a nun, but... just imagining some guy banging her... ugh.)                                                                      Penelope: It's almost impossible to get an appointment here, but Philippe was able to pull a few    strings and get us a booking!                                                                       Orion: What a champ... (What was I expecting? She’s a popular Instagram model for god’s sake! Way   out of your league. But still... Fuck, why am I so upset?)                                          Philippe: Oh my god, darling! Citizens of Kredon! May I have your attention please?! Your most      beautiful goddess, my gorgeous girlfriend, has finally arrived! How can you shine so much, sweetie? I’m going to start wearing my sunglasses around you!                                                Penelope: Philly! How's everything going?                                                           Philippe: So much better now that you’ve returned to me, my fabulous little doll! What spell of     beauty did you cast on your hair?! Teach me, teach me, you luscious wizard!                         Penelope: I used that new hairspray you recommended to me.                                          Philippe: Just look at those gorgeous curls! We’re gonna need to get you in the studio ASAP before I gobble you all up! Can’t wait to take your pictures!                                               Penelope: Aww! Well today you’re off the hook, remember? Orion here is gonna be my photographer this time.                                                                                              Philippe: Huh? Ahhh... yeah, that’s right. Orion... Goodness me! Would you look at that! Penny, you said you were bringing over a photographer... not a STALLION!                                       Orion: Um... T-Thanks?                                                                              Philippe: And he seems quite fit too... He could have a future as a model. Can you take your shirt  off? Do a little twirl for me?                                                                      Orion: What? Do I have to?                                                                          Philippe: Maybe as an underwear model... How big are you down there, pretty boy? You’ve got to be   packing something dangerous...                                                                      Orion: Um...                                                                                        Penelope: *Laughs* Come on Philly, go easy on him! What would Paul say?                             Philippe: Oh god please, don't tell him! With how jealous he gets... Alright then, you can do a     little dance for me later, Orion. Come on in, sweeties! You have the whole studio all to yourselves until 12:00. Then Mr. Valentino has it booked for the rest of the day.                              Penelope: Wow, Valentino?!                                                                          Philippe: That's right, my tulip! He's coming by later today. Be sure to take some good photos if   you want to impress him.                                                                            Penelope: We'll try!                                                                                Philippe: I hope you're a good photographer, Orion. My queen here deserves only the best! I'll stop yammering on though and leave you both to it. Ta ta!                                                Penelope: Come on, let's go inside! We’re already on the clock!                                     Orion: Erm... S-Sure! Whoa, this place looks like the real deal!                                    Penelope: Of course, because it is!                                                                 Orion: Are we free to use anything in here?                                                         Penelope: Most definitely! As long as we don't break anything, of course.                           Orion: *Chuckles* I'll try not to. Alright, let’s get down to business! I think I’ll have to adjust the lights a bit though.                                                                            Penelope: I can do it, no worries. While I work on that, would you mind grabbing me something from  the refreshment table?                                                                              Orion: Sure, no problem! What do you want?                                                          Penelope: Surprise me! The table should be over by the entrance. Feel free to take whatever you want for yourself as well.                                                                              Orion: Cool! I'll go take a look. Be right back! (Ah, here it is. Looks like they’ve got coffee and donuts. Damn, those donuts look so good.)                                                           Get a donut for Penelope                                                                            Orion: (I'm sure she’d love one. Who isn’t a fan of donuts?)                                        Get a coffee for Penelope                                                                           Orion: (I should get her a coffee to help her stay focused during the shoot.)                       1 teaspoon of sugar 2 teaspoons of sugar 3 teaspoons of sugar                                       Orion: (This will do.)                                                                              Philippe: Mr. Valentino! My apologies, but the studio is still taken until noon.                    Orion: (Huh?)                                                                                       Mr. Valentino: What?!                                                                               Philippe: You arrived a little early, sir. You have the place booked from 12 to 6.                  Mr. Valentino: This is ridiculous! *Sighs* Bah, whatever... I'll just wait. If you need me, I'll be in the booth getting measurements of my model... 30 minutes should be enough... Am I right, honey?  Philippe: Oh, dear...                                                                               Orion: Is that the Valentino fella you mentioned earlier, Philippe? What does he do?                Philippe: He's the best fashion agent in the country. Or at least... one of the best. He's an       asshole, but if he likes you, he can make your modeling career take off. I wanted to show him some  pics of Penny later.                                                                                Orion: Oh... I see. Then I’ll make sure you’ll have plenty of nice pictures to choose from. Time to head back inside!                                                                                   Philippe: Sure thing. Good luck and have fun, darling!                                              Orion: (Hmm... I'm gonna grab a donut for myself as well. Or maybe two... Or I could just sneak off with the entire basket...) *Stuffing face with donuts* Mmm... I'm back! I brought you a donut!      Penelope: A... donut?                                                                               Orion: With extra chocolate! White chocolate!                                                       Penelope: But... isn't this pretty fattening?                                                       Orion: Well, the only other thing they had was coffee. I figured you would’ve preferred something to eat.                                                                                               Penelope: Yeah but I can’t afford too many empty calories...                                        Orion: But it tastes good!                                                                          Penelope: Uhm... yeah, thanks I guess. I’ll probably just eat it later...                           Orion: (Oops, should’ve went for the coffee.)                                                       Penelope: We should start, we only have 25 minutes left.                                            Orion: I brought you a coffee!                                                                      Penelope: Ah, nice! I love coffee! How many teaspoons did you put? Ah, yes! Just what I needed!     Orion: I remember you mentioned preferring 3 teaspoons.                                             Penelope: Exactly right! Someone is a good listener... thank you for remembering! That'll do. Thank you.                                                                                                Orion: Anytime! So... This boyfriend of yours... Philippe... He seems a bit...                      Penelope: *Laughs* Gay, right?                                                                      Orion: *Laughs* Yeah, sorry to break the bad news to you.                                           Penelope: *Giggles* No, but seriously, he's been a really good friend. I met him and his husband    Paul last year. They always help me find auditions. He always calls me his “girlfriend”.            Orion: He seems like a nice guy.                                                                    Penelope: He is!                                                                                    Orion: So... You don’t have a real boyfriend then...?                                               Penelope: ...No. My last "boyfriend" was in high school, and... that relationship didn’t last very  long. I decided to focus on more important things when I started college.                           Orion: (Why do I feel so relieved all of a sudden? Wake up Orion, we're talking about Penelope here. Still not gonna happen.)                                                                           Penelope: Anyway, we should start taking some photos, don't you think?                              Orion: Sure! Where do you wanna pose?                                                               Penelope: Well, since this stuff is already set up, we might as well use it.                        Orion: I agree. I like the look of this scene.                                                      Penelope: Yes, it has a very modern and open feel to it.                                            Orion: (Oh Jesus.)                                                                                  Penelope: And the black and white colors complement my attire.                                      Orion: Y-Yeah. Is this a lingerie photoshoot or something?                                          Penelope: Oh, well, not entirely. But since I’m sponsored by this brand, I have to show off their   bra in at least a few photos.                                                                       Orion: ...Yeah, that makes sense. (Must... not... stare...) That’s a nice bra.                      Penelope: Thanks. This brand has been sponsoring me for around four months now. I’ve also had to    model their bikini line before. I don't know if you remember seeing those pics on my Instagram      profile.                                                                                            Orion: (Remember them? I fuckin’ worshipped those pictures...) Hm, I think I vaguely remember...    yeah...                                                                                             Penelope: Well, time for you to do your thing. Do you know how to focus the lens?                   Orion: Know how to focus? Are you doubting my skills here? I’ll have you know, my focus skills are  magical. Time for my first spell... FOCUS POCUS!                                                    Penelope: *Laughs* Come on, don't make me laugh!                                                    Orion: *Chuckles* I’ll take any opportunity to see that smile! Ok, ok, now let’s both FOCUS here! No more silliness...                                                                                  Penelope: Does the lighting look okay? How are the shadows?                                         Orion: It all looks good to me. Although... I think the shorts are a bit distracting.               Penelope: The shorts? What do you mean?                                                             Orion: Like, they stand out too much against the other muted colors. I could try to just shoot only your upper body. (Gotta tread carefully here... don’t want to come off sounding like a pervert.)    Penelope: Hmm... No, I definitely think it’s important to show off a little bit of leg in these     pictures too. How about I just... There. Good call, Orion. I definitely think the bright blue jeans were out of place. Or... maybe someone was just trying to take advantage of me...                   Orion: Come on Penny, you know I'd never do that.                                                   Penelope: Yeah... I'm sorry. I’ve just had so many photographers and managers that have been total  creeps. It’s really disheartening.                                                                  Orion: I can imagine.                                                                               Penelope: But that’s why I’m glad to have you here, Orion.                                          Orion: (Maintain eye contact Orion, you can't afford to look bad now...)                            Penelope: This thing will support my weight, right?                                                 Orion: (Wow...)                                                                                     Penelope: It looks like it’s only being held up by one nail...                                      Orion: I doubt it's gonna fall. How much do you weigh?                                              Penelope: Hey, you can't ask a lady that!                                                           Orion: *Chuckles* My bad.                                                                           Penelope: How does it look now?                                                                     Orion: Much better. Can you pull your hair back? So your bra is more visible?                       Penelope: Sure, good idea.                                                                          Orion: Ohhh yeah, beautiful! Okay, let me try another angle... Perfect... I must be a natural at    this! Just a bit of zoom... Oh shit. Um... Erm... (Damn it, I got too cocky. How the fuck does this camera work?) Ah, now I got it. Ah, no I don’t. . . . ...Or do I? Hmmm... Ah, okay, now I got it for real.                                                                                              Take the photo with zoom in                                                                         Orion: Ahh... This is definitely a keeper. No doubt.                                                Penelope: . . . . . .                                                                               Orion: I thought it would be more... artistic.                                                      Penelope: . . .                                                                                     Orion: O-Okay, w-we can take another.                                                               Penelope: And you better do it right this time.                                                     Take the photo with normal zoom                                                                     Orion: Now that’s a good one. What do you think?                                                    Penelope: Whoa, it looks great! I love that angle, very nice. I might need you to be my photographer more often, Orion! Do you think we can take a few more?                                            Take the photo with zoom out                                                                        Orion: Ahh... Yeah, this one... *Chef’s kiss* In order for an artist to innovate, they must first   take risks. Now this is cutting edge!                                                               Penelope: . . . . . .                                                                               Orion: I thought it would be more artistic.                                                         Penelope: . . .                                                                                     Orion: O-Okay, w-we can take another.                                                               Penelope: And you better do it right this time.                                                     Orion: Absolutely! I think I'm getting the hang of it! It really helps that you’re a natural at     posing too. You’re doing all this so effortlessly! Ah! Quickly, get over there! I'm envisioning the perfect shot! Beautiful! Hold that pose!                                                            Penelope: Woooow! That was fantastic! Where did you learn about photography and lighting?           Orion: Learn? Me Orion. Me point to pretty thing. Me press button. Me likey.                        Penelope: Well, you sure do know how to push a button, Orion.                                       Orion: I'm glad you like them, Penny!                                                               Penelope: I love them, really. These are going to be perfect for my private collection. They're too good not to keep!                                                                                   Orion: What? I thought you wanted to use these for your Instagram? Is there something wrong with    them?                                                                                               Penelope: No! Like I said before, you did an amazing job! They look great! It's just... um... I look like I'm...                                                                                        Orion: Whaaat? Come on Penny, don't tell me you're actually embarrassed about yourself in these     pictures?                                                                                           Penelope: It's not about being embarrassed. I don’t want people to view my profile and get the      impression that I’m just another slutty model who’s looking for sugar daddies.                      Orion: But I saw your profile and noticed a few suggestive pictures already.                        Penelope: Yeah... I know I've posted some saucy content in the past. But that was before I really   wanted to start taking this career path seriously. I'm trying to steer my content into a new        direction now, so I don't attract the wrong type of attention in the future. I want to be seen as   legitimate. I realize a couple of revealing pictures are still on my profile, but those are of me in a bikini at the beach or the pool. That's totally different. With these pictures, I’m in my        underwear, in a cold photo studio... It just gives off a bad impression.                            Orion: I get what you mean.                                                                         Penelope: I don't mind you seeing me like this, because... I don't know, I just feel comfortable    around you. But I don't want anyone else to see me like this. There’s a lot of creeps out there and attracting a larger following on Instagram has opened my eyes to it. I've received a lot of         disturbing messages before... And besides, what would my mom say if she saw me posting those        pictures? She'd probably think it was an introductory photoshoot to a porno or something...         Orion: You have a spectacular body that you work hard for! You shouldn’t be ashamed to show it off. You should be proud of how beautiful you are. And I'm pretty sure Nancy would agree with me.        Penelope: I know it doesn't make much sense if I really want to be a model, because I know some     photoshoots will be more risque than others, but... that's how I feel.                              Orion: Hey, no worries. I understand. I know you enjoy modeling, but it definitely shouldn’t define you or what you “have to do”. You should only do what you’re comfortable with. Go on and keep these photos for yourself. We had our fun here and it was really nice to see this side of you.            Penelope: Exactly! I enjoyed sharing it with you too. Thank you for understanding my absurdities,   Orion.                                                                                              Orion: Anytime, Penny. I hope you’ll tolerate mine too.                                             Penelope: *Giggles* I'm sure I can do that. And hey, this wasn't a complete waste of time. Maybe in 20 years, I can show these photos to my daughter to prove how pretty I used to be!                  Orion: *Chuckles* I'm sure you'll be just as beautiful in 20 years, if not more so.                 Penelope: *Giggles* We'll see. I'll let the father of my children be the judge of that.             Orion: He’ll be a lucky man...                                                                      Mr. Valentino: OK, EVERYBODY OUT! Nico Valentino needs the studio. Stop whatever you’re doing and   clear out! You’re on my time now! Huh? There’s only two people here?                                Penelope: O-Oh my god, Mr. Valentino!                                                               Mr. Valentino: Well, well, well, who do we have here... What's your name, pretty thing?             Penelope: P-Penelope. I'm a huge fan. I loved what you showed off at the Barcelona Fashion Show last year. The blouse I brought with me is actually from your fall collection!                          Mr. Valentino: Are you a model too, honey?                                                          Penelope: I'm trying, yes!                                                                          Mr. Valentino: Not bad, not bad... I see some potential in you. You do have a really nice body,     darling. Who's your surgeon?                                                                        Penelope: Thank you! I... W-Wait, what? What surgeon? I'm all natural.                              Mr. Valentino: What? No way those tits are real.                                                    Penelope: Um, they definitely are.                                                                  Mr. Valentino: Oh, boy! That's even better, then. Alright, let me see them. Take that thing off for me and spin a couple of times.                                                                      Penelope: What do you mean? Take what off...?                                                       Mr. Valentino: Your bra. Come on, we're not 15 anymore.                                             Penelope: I’m not going to get naked for you...                                                     Mr. Valentino: Look, I need to inspect the merchandise before I decide to work with it. Hurry up    now, I don't have all day.                                                                          Orion: *Clears throat* Alright buddy, she already said she doesn't want to.                         Mr. Valentino: Who the fuck are you? Her manager?                                                   Orion: Um... yeah, you could say that.                                                              Mr. Valentino: Well then, any good manager wants to find work for their client. So do your job and  tell her to strip already.                                                                          Orion: I told you, she doesn’t want to do it.                                                       Mr. Valentino: And I don't give a fuck what she said. Look, dude, do you know who I am? Are you new to this industry or something? I can turn this girl into the next big runway star. I'm not even     asking for a blowjob this time, I just want to see her damn body. I’m going to say this one last    time, because I really hate repeating myself: tell this bitch to do what I’m telling her. You know  how many girls would kill to be in her shoes right now?                                             Persuade Penelope to get naked                                                                      Orion: (I mean, he does have a point. This could be a very good chance for Penelope to hit it big.) Hey, Penny, I think you should really reconsider.                                                   Penelope: What? You can't be serious.                                                               Orion: You're the one making this a big deal. All you have to do is take off your bra and show this guy your tits. It will be quick and painless. Philippe mentioned he's the best in the business...   I'm sure he's got plenty of connections out there, Penny. You’re finally getting the chance you’ve  been waiting for. This could be the step to finally achieving your dreams! You can become a real    model! All you have to do is flash your tits in a photo studio. So what??                           Penelope: But...                                                                                    Orion: Come on, you know you can trust me. I wouldn’t do you wrong.                                 Penelope: . . . Just my bra, right...? That’s it?                                                   Mr. Valentino: Yeah, yeah... that's it.                                                             Penelope: . . . *Unhooking her bra*                                                                 Orion: (Oh god, she's shaking. DAMN.)                                                               Penelope: . . .                                                                                     Mr. Valentino: Wow! Your tits are massive! That tiny waist of yours make them look even bigger, too! Very nice, honey. I'm getting hard already. Come on, spin for me. I wanna see it all. Wow! Look at that ass! You’re the complete package! Where have you been hiding all this time, darling?           Penelope: . . .                                                                                     Mr. Valentino: That's what I call a nice ass. Hell yeah. Huge, but still soft as fuck. Perfect for  me to grip. You must be tight in all the right places, huh, darling?                                Penelope: . . .                                                                                     Mr. Valentino: Can't wait to get to know you even better... Mmm. Our next meeting will be in my     office, so we can... sign that contract. Really seal the deal. Does that sound good?                Penelope: . . .                                                                                     Mr. Valentino: *Chuckles* Yeah, you seem like a smart girl. You’re just doing what’s best for your  future... Well alright then, get out of here. I need the studio for another model. My staff will be here any minute.                                                                                    Orion: What about Penelope?                                                                         Mr. Valentino: Yeah, yeah, I'll call her next week. Now get out.                                    Orion: Okay, give us a minute. Hey, Penny... Sorry, I didn't know he was gonna be so handsy. But    hey, you got the job! He said he's gonna call you!                                                  Penelope: . . . Yeah, g-great... let's just go.                                                     Orion: Ok... Well, do you have all of your belongings?                                              Penelope: . . .                                                                                     Orion: Penny?                                                                                       Penelope: Um... Look, Orion. I... I didn't like that at all.                                        Orion: I'm sorry, I didn't want to...                                                               Penelope: Let me finish. I'm not some whore. I'm not gonna suck anyone's dick just to become a      model. And I'm not posing nude for strangers. I thought I made my intentions clear earlier. I don't like it and I refuse to do it. Despite what you may think, I have standards. I guess this modeling  thing just isn't for me.                                                                            Orion: But...                                                                                       Penelope: I think I’d rather focus on finishing my degree now. I want to leave all this nonsense    behind. I'm going home.                                                                             Orion: (Fuck, I didn't know it would affect her like this.) Okay... I understand. I'm sorry. Let me grab another one of those donuts and we'll...                                                       Penelope: Don't worry about me. I’d rather go back alone. I’ll just take the bus.                   Orion: Oh... okay then... see you home.                                                             Penelope: Sure. Bye.                                                                                Orion: (Man, I feel so bad now... I hope she gets over this soon. Hopefully by tomorrow... Hold up, what the...)                                                                                        Tell Mr. Valentino to fuck off                                                                      Orion: You know what? I think I have a better idea. Why don't you take that tripod over there and   shove it up your ass. Maybe that’ll keep you from being such a cunt.                                Mr. Valentino: Excuse me...?! Who do you think you are, you stupid little kid? I'm Nico Valentino!  Keep testing me and I’ll ensure your bimbo friend here can’t find a modeling gig anywhere!          Orion: What's up with people in this town? Everybody thinks they're the most important douchebag in the world. I don't give a shit if your name is Valentino, Bardot, or fucking Spongebob Squarepants. We still have 10 minutes left, so you’re actually on our time. So you can either start lubing up    that tripod or get the hell out.                                                                    Mr. Valentino: Grrrr... fucking kid... you’re going to regret this! That dumb bitch has lost any    chance of becoming a model!                                                                         Orion: Fuck. Off.                                                                                   Mr. Valentino: Bah!                                                                                 Orion: Fuck that guy. "Thit bitch hurs lust duh chins ti bi i midil" What a... Oh my god. Oh, SHIT! I just ruined your chances of getting that modeling gig, haven’t I?! Oh god, I’m sorry! I just got  carried away. Why does this keep happening to me? I screwed up! I destroyed your dream! I'm so      sorry, I'll go apologize to Mr. Valentino right now! Let me...                                      Penelope: *Laughs* Don't you even think about apologizing.                                          Orion: ...No? Wait, you're not angry?                                                               Penelope: Of course not. Quite the opposite, actually. I loved what you said to him. He had it      coming.                                                                                             Orion: What about the modeling job, though?                                                         Penelope: Meh, it doesn't matter. I wasn't gonna use today's photos anyway. And I'm doing fine on   Instagram without him. As long as I keep posting photos, I know something will turn up. I'm in no   rush. And if not, that's why I'm still pursuing my degree!                                          Orion: Well, I'm glad to see you keeping a positive attitude! I guess we should get going now.      Penelope: You know... this whole thing got me thinking... And I realized, I've never had nude photos taken of me. Mainly because I haven’t had anyone that I was truly comfortable with.                Orion: *Gulps* Uh-huh...                                                                            Penelope: Maybe we could use our remaining 10 minutes to take a few topless photos. I mean, they    aren’t gonna be published anyways. I really just want to have some for my own private collection.   Orion: Makes sense...                                                                               Penelope: That Valentino guy made me realize that I'll never feel comfortable doing something like  this with a stranger. But you’re no stranger, Orion, and since I have you here...                   Orion: Umm... Just to recap... Y-You want me to take some pictures of you while you’re... topless?  Penelope: Well, I mean... If you're not comfortable with it, that's okay. Just thought that...      Orion: N-NO! I mean, yes, sure, no problem! Let’s get those puppies out! Er, I mean—let me get that camera back out! Whatever you need!                                                                 Penelope: Awesome! Thank you, Orion. It's nice to have someone I can truly trust. I feel like I     don’t have to be ashamed around you. Aside from Philippe and Paul, everyone I've ever met in the    fashion world has been a pervert or a freeloader.                                                   Orion: I can imagine... (Oh my god, am I about to see Penelope naked? Thank you, Jesus.)            Penelope: That sleazy guy is gone, right?                                                           Orion: Y-Yeah, I made sure of it. Don't worry, I'll warn you if I hear him coming.                  Penelope: Alright then.                                                                             Orion: (OH SWEET BABY JESUS. LOOK AT THOSE MAGNIFICENT BEAUTIES.)                                   Penelope: Let's get to it!                                                                          Orion: Y-Y-Yeah!                                                                                    Penelope: How should we do it?                                                                      Orion: D-Do it?                                                                                     Penelope: What pose?                                                                                Orion: P-P-Pose?                                                                                    Penelope: Yeah, for the first set of pictures. How should I pose? You’re the expert here, aren’t    you?                                                                                                Orion: Ah! Yeah, of course! (Come on, Orion, stay focused. I think all my blood is being directed to the wrong head...) I like how you posed before. We can try that one again...                       Penelope: Sure! Sounds good.                                                                        Orion: Y-Yeah, this is a good angle. (You're seeing something that many men would pay a lot of money for, Orion. How the hell did I get so lucky? Man, her breasts are shaped so perfectly. And that    tiny waist of hers makes them seem even bigger.)                                                    Penelope: What about this one?                                                                      Orion: A-Also really nice. Sexy as hell...                                                          Penelope: Come on, you’ve been behind the camera for too long!                                      Orion: What??                                                                                       Penelope: Let's take a picture together!                                                            Orion: Not a chance.                                                                                Penelope: Oh don’t be like that! It'll be fun!                                                      Orion: No, it won't!                                                                                Penelope: *Pulling your jersey off* Let’s get rid of this! We both need to be topless!              Orion: No! I'm gonna look like a deformed potato next to you!                                       Penelope: *Laughs* That's not true! You're very handsome!                                           Orion: Oh please, Penny! I'm really not photogenic, don't make me do it!                            Penelope: Shhh, stop complaining and come sit down!                                                 Orion: . . .                                                                                        Penelope: *Looking through the camera* You look great!                                              Orion: Yeah, sure.                                                                                  Penelope: Ok, let me set the timer... Done! On my way! Alright, I set the timer for 15 seconds.     *Giggles* Isn't this fun?!                                                                          Orion: Y-Yeah, so much fun... (Oh no. Please no. Not now. Bad dick! No time for boner! Alright, just calm down Orion. Stop overthinking things. We’re just making art! Don’t think about Penelope's     huge, perfect tits. Try not to notice how the cold breeze is stiffening her pink, perky nipples...  Not gonna think about the cute, little freckles all over her curvy body... Or how her breasts are   slightly paler than the rest of body... because she probably never sunbathes topless... meaning     you’re likely the first man who’s gotten to see her breasts in who knows how long... and...)        Penelope: Huh?? Oh, come on, Orion! You're not even looking at the camera! We have to do another    one!                                                                                                Orion: I think that’s good enough, Penny. Valentino is gonna come back at any moment.               Penelope: I know, I know! That's why we gotta hurry! Last one and we're done. 15 seconds!           Orion: . . . !!! (Oh shit.)                                                                         Penelope: Am I centered? I can't tell.                                                              Orion: (Oh my fucking god... My dick is rubbing up against her ass...)                              Penelope: Huh? (Oh my god. Is this... Is this huge thing I’m feeling... his... His...) . . .        Orion: . . .                                                                                        Penelope: Uhm...                                                                                    Orion: (Oh god... Now I feel like that Valentino pervert...) Um...                                  Penelope: I'm so sorry, I didn't...                                                                 Orion: No! I'm the one who's sorry! I didn't mean to...                                             Penelope: It's o-okay! I mean, I should have known that was gonna happen. I got carried away. It's  just, I'm not used to...                                                                            Orion: No no... It's my fault. I...                                                                 Penelope: I'm gonna go get dressed before Valentino comes back. I'll meet you by the entrance.      Orion: S-Sure! (Well, this time it wasn't my fault. The same thing would have happened to any man in my situation. I hope this doesn't make things awkward. I loved how uninhibited she was with me.)   *Sighs* (Anyways, I should head to the door.) Um... Hey Penny, do you have all of your belongings?  Penelope: . . .                                                                                     Orion: Penny?                                                                                       Penelope: *Giggles*                                                                                 Orion: Uhh... Are you laughing?                                                                     Penelope: *Laughs* You got a huge hard-on back there!                                               Orion: Um... Y-Yeah, well, what man wouldn’t have gotten one? Probably just Gandhi!!                Penelope: *Laughs* Is that why you were making such a weird face in our last picture?               Orion: W-Well, yeah. What do you expect! You pounced on me while you were half-naked!               Penelope: *Giggles* Fair enough. I have to admit, this was one of the funniest photoshoots I’ve ever done! I don't know what it is about you, but... I always have so much fun when you’re around.      Orion: Me too, Penelope. I'm just sorry about what happened with that douchebag earlier...          Penelope: I told you not to worry! I'll find some other way to achieve my goal. I don’t need to     flaunt my boobs to some weirdo to succeed. Well, maybe except for one...                            Orion: Did you just call me a weirdo?                                                               Penelope: *Giggles* Me? I'd never dare.                                                             Orion: You know, being serious... Have you ever thought about cosplaying as Eternum characters? Most of Instagram's top models do that.                                                                 Penelope: I've thought about it, yeah, but I'd have to play Eternum first. And I'm not good at video games.                                                                                             Orion: That's the thing! Eternum isn’t your typical video game! It's... how do I describe it...     completely different from what you’d expect! Ever since I started playing the other day, I haven’t  been able to get it off my mind. It’s incredible! You have to try it!                               Penelope: Doesn't the neural implant cost like $3500?                                               Orion: Well, yeah, that's the only downside.                                                        Penelope: Mmmm... I have some money saved up from my sponsorships. Maybe it’ll be enough to buy one.Orion: Really?! Then let's do it! What are you waiting for?!                                        Penelope: That's all I have right now. I don’t know if I want to splurge it all on a game. I'm not  sure if it's worth it.                                                                              Orion: Believe me, it is. First of all, it's an amazing experience that’s unlike anything else. And second, you can earn all that money back once you start posting Eternum cosplay content! When brands see you playing the game, all those sponsorship offers will start pouring in.                      Penelope: Hmm... well... You know what? Screw it. Let’s do it!                                      Orion: Awesome! I can't wait to play with you, Penny! You're gonna love it!                         Penelope: I'll order the neural implant as soon as I get home. If I’m paying that much for it, I    might as well get the expedited shipping too so it gets here in a couple of days.                   Orion: Then let’s not delay! The sooner you buy it, the sooner we can play together!                Penelope: Alright then, let's go. You can grab a couple more donuts before we leave, if you want. I noticed how much you were drooling every time you passed by them...                                 Orion: Don’t gotta tell me twice! Be right back!                                                    Penelope: *Giggles* Ok.                                                                             Orion: (Man, Penny is gonna join us in Eternum! That's awesome. Now I just have to convince Nancy... Hmm? Hold up, what the...) Um... Nova?                                                             Nova: Mmph?                                                                                         Orion: . . .                                                                                        Nova: . . .                                                                                         Orion: . . .                                                                                        Nova: Orion! I mmwas mmooking mor mmyou!                                                            Orion: What? I didn't understand any of that.                                                       Nova: *Leaving the food on the table* I said I was looking for you! *Giggles* Sorry, I saw these    donuts and I couldn't resist.                                                                       Orion: What are you doing here?! Don’t eat all of my donuts! A-And... are you following me?!        Nova: Of course not! I called you, but you didn't answer. So I tracked down your phone and saw you  were here...                                                                                        Orion: What?! Again?? You have to stop doing this!                                                  Nova: Oh, who's that?                                                                               Orion: Don't try to change the subject!                                                             Nova: No, no, seriously, it's him! Ohhh... false alarm. I thought I saw Keanu Reeves going to the   bathroom...                                                                                         Orion: Yeah, sure, that sounds super believable. Nova, you have to stop hacking me!                 Nova: Wait a second... Is that...                                                                   Orion: Don't try to change the subject!                                                             Nova: No, no, seriously! Is that Penelope?                                                          Orion: Um... Yeah. Why? Do you know her? Oh wait... of course you know her. You probably hacked into my Instagram account and pulled up all the people I’m following!                                   Nova: No! I haven’t touched your Instagram... I know her from college! She's like the most popular  girl on campus!                                                                                     Orion: Oh, really? Wow! Finally one account of mine that you haven’t hacked into! What a relief.    Nova: I was wondering why Nancy and her shared the same last name on your followers list. Nancy is  her mom! How could I miss it!                                                                       Orion: Never mind...                                                                                Nova: Can I go say hi?                                                                              Orion: Um... I guess.                                                                               Nova: H-Hello!                                                                                      Penelope: Hi there!                                                                                 Nova: Um... I'm Nova, nice to meet you! I’ve always wanted to say hi, but you're usually surrounded by people. And... I don't have any social media accounts, but I've seen your photos. They're so     beautiful! Very artistic!                                                                           Penelope: Oh well, thank you so much! That's always nice to hear.                                   Nova: I've never met a celebrity before!                                                            Penelope: *Chuckles* Oh god, please... I'm far from a celebrity. Almost no one knows me outside of  Kredon. Are you a friend of Orion? From high school?                                                Nova: N-No... *Nervous laughter* Actually... you and I go to the same college. Erm... I usually sit right behind you in Digital Media class.                                                            Penelope: Oh my god! I'm so sorry! It's just, sometimes I'm so focused on the class that I don't    notice what's around me!                                                                            Nova: NO IT'S TOTALLY OKAY! S-Sorry, didn’t mean to yell... I’m just a little nervous. No, it’s     alright. I know you usually just do your own thing and don’t pay attention to what all the “popular” people are doing. That's actually why I like you!                                                  Penelope: Still, I'm sorry I didn't notice you before.                                              Nova: Seriously, don't worry about it. I'm used to it. Most of our other classmates don't even know I exist. I usually go unnoticed everywhere I go. Which, frankly, is pretty odd because I’m always   screaming, I wear a freakin’ eyepatch, and my orange hair makes me look like a Cheeto with legs. But seriously, it's all good.                                                                          Penelope: Well, thank you for not holding that against me. We can sit together during class next    time, if you want.                                                                                  Nova: That sounds great! I'd love that! I always knew you'd be nice! You just seem like a           good-natured person.                                                                                Penelope: I'll see you Monday then. Nice to meet you, Nova!                                         Nova: Good to meet you as well!                                                                     Penelope: Well, I gotta go now. Take care, Orion.                                                   Orion: Don't you want me to go with you?                                                            Penelope: Nah, it's ok. You’ve done more than enough. Thank you for everything. I really loved      spending time with you today and am looking forward to many more adventures with you.               Orion: Anytime, Penny. I loved it too. Maybe even too much...                                       Penelope: *Giggles* Are you having dinner at home tonight?                                          Orion: Most likely. As long as I can stop myself from eating the rest of those donuts. You don't    have any plans today?                                                                               Penelope: Nah, I've got an early day tomorrow. Maybe I'll go on YouTube and watch a few guides on   how to play Eternum.                                                                                Orion: Can't wait for your neural implant to arrive! You’re going to have such a blast!             Penelope: Hope you’ll be my teacher because I have a lot of things to learn... Alright. Guess I’ll  see you at home!                                                                                    Orion: Take care, Penny!                                                                            Penelope: Bye-bye, Nova! It was nice meeting you!                                                   Nova: Likewise!                                                                                     Penelope: I'll see you in class!                                                                    Nova: Sure!                                                                                         Orion: (Was she flirting with me or am I going crazy? I’ve never been good at taking a hint. Nah,   I'm probably imagining things... just like Chang does all the time.)                                Nova: Oh my god, she's super nice!                                                                  Orion: Right? My earlier memories of her are a bit blurry, but I do remember her being nice even    back then. She never fit the stereotype of a stuck-up, popular teenage girl.                        Nova: I'll be honest Orion, at first you struck me as a complete bore, but you've really impressed  me! First, I discovered you were awarded a scholarship for having the top GPA at your European      school. Then, I found out that you won a video game development contest when you were only 14! And  now I’ve come to learn that you’re friends with Penelope too?! Oh, did I mention that your taste in anime is amazing too?! We’ve seen pretty much all of the same shows on Netflix! That’s a huge plus  in my book!                                                                                         Orion: STOP. HACKING. ME!!! Do you even know what privacy means?!                                   Nova: Oh come on, Orion... I thought we were past that already! I'm a hacker! I hack things. That's my thing! Would you ask an alcoholic to stop drinking?                                              Orion: Um... yes?                                                                                   Nova: Anyyyyyways, there's a reason I'm here! I KNOW HOW TO FIND IT!                                Orion: Find what?                                                                                   Nova: *Whispers loudly* CALYPSO!                                                                    Orion: No way, already?! Are you serious?                                                           Nova: I finished deploying my divergence malware! Now I can teleport you to any server you want. No need for invitations or a publicly accessible area, I just need the name of the server. And I       already opened a path to Ogygia! Now we can see if Calypso is really there!                         Orion: That's amazing!                                                                              Nova: Yeah, well, having both extensive programming and networking knowledge is out of reach for    most people. That’s why no one has been able to create something like this before... Luckily for    you, you just happen to know the best hacker in the country.                                        Compliment her                                                                                      Orion: Alright, you’ve outdone yourself yet again. Nova... you truly are incredible.                Nova: *Giggles* Thank you.                                                                          Orion: I have no idea how you’re able to pull off such computer wizardry. How are you not a         fedora-wearing neckbeard who lives in their mother’s basement?!                                     Nova: *Laughs* Well I do still live with my parents, but thank you.                                 Orion: You said you were gonna do something, and you did it. I'm impressed.                         Nova: Yes, I did... And... how about how fast I did it? It only took me a few hours.                Orion: *Laughs* And you were incredibly fast. *Chuckles* I've never met a girl so hungry for praise, but honestly you deserve every bit of it!                                                          Nova: Thank you! Alright then, let's not waste any more time. Our clock is ticking!                 Orion: How so?                                                                                      Don't waste any time                                                                                Orion: Ok, let's not waste any more time, then!                                                     Nova: Yep, that's probably a good idea. The malware was able to use a zero-day BGP exploit to infect the AS on which the Eternum traffic primarily traverses.                                           Orion: Mm-hm.                                                                                       Nova: Through that exploit, it remotely accessed their external routers, which foolishly weren’t    utilizing OOB management, and then use CDP to find the IP address of the layer-3 switch that hosts  the servers.                                                                                        Orion: Uh-huh.                                                                                      Nova: It was able to SSH into it, execute the “do sh int stat” command, and identify the Ogygia     server. Then it finally established an encrypted tunnel to the server, for us to utilize.           Orion: Makes sense.                                                                                 Nova: Unfortunately, this entire exploit can only run so long before it’s flagged and quarantined by the ISP’s IPS.                                                                                     Orion: . . . Erm... And in English that means that...                                               Nova: We need to access that server in the next 30 minutes, or the "door" will close forever.       Orion: WHAT?! Why didn't you say that before?!                                                      Nova: We would have had more time if you had answered the phone when I called you. It's not my      fault.                                                                                              Orion: Dammit! We still have time, though! I'll run back home! What do we have to do?               Nova: Just connect to Eternum and log into any of the public servers. I'll do the rest.             Orion: Okay! What about Alex? Can you call her?                                                     Nova: Sure, no worries, I'll let her know. I'll connect you both once you're online. Hurry up!      Orion: Alright! See you in a few!                                                                   Nova: Later!                                                                                        Orion: (Ahh... It feels good to have the house all to myself. Who needs women anyway? Not me!) Hmm? (Nova? Don't tell me she has already found a way in...) Hello?                                      Nova: Orion!!!!                                                                                     Orion: God! Don't scream!                                                                           Nova: I KNOW HOW TO FIND IT!                                                                        Orion: Find it? Calypso?!                                                                           Nova: CALYPSO!!!                                                                                    Orion: No way, already?! Are you serious?                                                           Nova: I finished deploying my divergence malware! Now I can teleport you to any server you want. No need for invitations or a publicly accessible area, I just need the name of the server. And I       already opened a path to Ogygia! Now we can see if Calypso is really there!                         Orion: That's amazing!

Orion: How so?

Why didn't you say that before?!                                                      Nova: We would have had more time if you had answered the phone when I called you the first time!

Hurry up!                                                                                           Orion: Alright! See you in a few!                                                                   Nova: Later!                                                                                        Orion: Shit! I better hurry up! *Gasping for air* *Gasping for air* Oh g-god, I don’t think I’ve    ever run so fast in my life.                                                                        Penelope: Orion? You're soaked!                                                                     Orion: *Gasping for air* P-Penny... *Gasping for air* Yeah, I came running...                       Penelope: From the studio? That's like 5 miles away! And it's pouring outside!                      Orion: *Gasping for air* Yeah... w-what time is it?                                                 Penelope: 4:15 PM.                                                                                  Orion: Oh thank god, I made it! I still have 5 minutes left...                                      Penelope: For what?                                                                                 Orion: S-Something very important! The Weapons of Atlas. There are 3 of them and... Never mind, it'd take too long to explain! Look up that stuff and the Gems of Doom on Google! It'll come in handy   when you play.                                                                                      Penelope: *Laughs* Okay, okay, I will. I won't keep you any longer. Whatever you’re up to must be   pretty urgent.                                                                                      Orion: Thank you! See you later!                                                                    Penelope: Have fun playing.                                                                         Orion: F-Fuck, I'm soaked! Damn rain... *Looking at your phone* 4:15 PM... (Yes! I made it! I still have 5 minutes left! Thank god... Ok, let's connect to Eternum! Alright... Come on, come on, come   on...)                                                                                              Connected. Welcome back to Eternum. You do not have any server invitations. You will now be         redirected to the Main Nexus.                                                                       Orion: Yes, yes, yes, hurry up!                                                                     Please prepare to connect...                                                                        Orion: (Oh... This is the Main Nexus? I remember this place from when I first connected to Eternum.)Idriel: Hello, Orion.                                                                               Orion: (Ah, Eternum's AI. It'd probably be best not to mention anything regarding our intentions.   Ulysses staff members are probably monitoring all conversations. Nova said that all I had to do was join a public server.) Hi! It's nice to see you again. ...Idriel, right?                            Idriel: That is correct. I see that you haven't been invited to a server this time. You can either  join one of Eternum's public servers, or any of the servers that you’ve previously accessed. Hmm... Ion, Ekabar, and The Red Herring. Those are all good places. You must know some experienced         players.                                                                                            Orion: Yeah, I do. They've been helping me a lot.                                                   Idriel: Are you enjoying your experience in Eternum so far, Orion? Have you experienced... anything remarkable?                                                                                         Orion: N-No... Everything's been... pretty quiet and relaxed.                                       Idriel: Well, if that was what you were looking for... you're doing it right.                       Orion: For sure... (Why am I so anxious? She's just an AI. She's like any other NPC in a video game. She is incapable of judging me or accusing me of anything. She's probably talking to hundreds of   other players simultaneously, doing whatever her programming dictates. And yet... I almost feel like I’m being interrogated...)                                                                         Idriel: So... What's it gonna be? Ion? Ekabar?                                                      Orion: No... I'll just join a public server this time. Maybe there I can score myself an invitation to a new server.                                                                                    Idriel: You wish to visit a public server? Hmmm... I'll send you to Agora. It’s known as a central  hub for players to meet each other and exchange invitations to other servers. I'm sure you might be able to find what you are looking for.                                                              Orion: Sounds perfect.                                                                              Idriel: Good. Enjoy your session. Is there anything you'd like to know before you leave?            Orion: Well, since you brought it up... I'd like to know the location of the remaining Gems of Doom.Idriel: *Chuckles* I'm afraid I can't give you that information.                                    Orion: Well, I assumed so, but it was worth a try.                                                  Idriel: Is there anything else you'd like to know?                                                  Orion: I'd ask you more things, but if you're gonna keep saying you can't give me that information, I'd prefer not to waste my time.                                                                    Idriel: *Chuckles* Well... Maybe you're not asking the right questions... Don't you think...        ...Orion?                                                                                           Nova: Orion? Hello?! Oh shit, is he dead? Please don't be dead... I should have tested this more... This is what happens when you make me hurry! Well, technically he said there was no rush, but...    Orion: Mmmm... (Holy fuck... My head is spinning... This is even worse than the first time I joined Ion... F-F-Fuck, it's so cold out here... Shit, I can’t even feel my hands... Where am I? Is this   Ogygia? Where are Nova and Alex? I thought I heard Nova's voice earlier... Man, thank god the sun is out, otherwise I'd probably freeze to death. Maybe I should start moving. Hmm? Who's that? Wait,   that hair... Is that...) A-Alex? Is that you? Are you okay?!                                        Alex: Mmmmhh...                                                                                     Orion: *Sighs of relief* Oh, thank goodness you're alright.                                         Alex: Agh... my head... is spinning...                                                              Orion: I know, the same thing happened to me.                                                       Alex: Where are we?                                                                                 Orion: (Oh...) Um... O-O-Ogygia, I think.                                                           Alex: I logged in just like that girl told me, then Idriel connected me to the Cyrodiil server and  there was a weird glitch during the wormhole. I must’ve passed out after that.                      Orion: Y-Yeah, same.                                                                                Alex: I'm still a little dizzy... F-Fuck, I’m so cold.                                              Orion: Yeah, I can s-see that...                                                                    Alex: Come on, let’s walk around and get the blood flowing. It'll warm us up.                       Orion: Y-Yeah, maybe you should... Before we start moving... You know...                            Alex: Hmm? You son of a bitch.                                                                      Orion: What did I do?!                                                                              Alex: When were you planning on telling me?                                                         Orion: I just did!                                                                                  Alex: Yeah, after you took enough mental pictures for your spank bank, huh?                         Orion: Of course not!                                                                               Alex: Lord knows what you did while I was unconscious...                                            Orion: I woke up right before you did! And I'd never do anything to you like that!                  Alex: Yeah, if you say so...                                                                        Orion: I didn’t know that was going to happen! And come on, you can't blame me! Have you seen what  you’re wearing? That dress hardly covers anything!                                                  Alex: This is an elven mail woven by the Airewen. It increases the magical transmogrification       abilities of its wearer and provides protection from fire. It can even stop bullets.                Orion: Damn, really? And who decided to make it so sexy-looking?                                    Alex: I don't know, probably some nasty pervert like you.                                           Orion: Well, whoever did it, I need to thank them. You look hot, Alex.                              Alex: Bah.                                                                                          Nova: You're alive! Oh, thank god! Not gonna lie, I was trying to find an exit portal. I wasn’t sure you two were going to wake up.                                                                     Alex: Oh... Nova, right?                                                                            Nova: The one and only! It's a pleasure to see you again.                                           Alex: Where are we? Did we make it? Is this...                                                      Nova: Yep! This is Ogygia! The mission was a success!                                               Alex: I'll be honest, your phone call was... unexpected. What if I didn’t answer my phone? Would you two have visited this server without me? After I was the one who mentioned this place and its      connection to Calypso?                                                                              Nova: Nah, everything was under control. I knew you were at home. Your swimming lessons are from 8  to 12 on Sundays, and your next one isn’t until Monday. So you were completely free.                Alex: W-What? How do you know...                                                                    Orion: Yeah... she does that. You'll get used to it. By the way, what's with the suit, Nova? Between that and your hair, you stand out like a polar bear in the desert.                                 Nova: Ah, this is my hitman outfit. We entered this server in a rather... unconventional manner, so the general rules can't be applied here. We have the outfits we would’ve worn in the servers we were originally connecting to. In my case, the Sin City server. Alex... you were headed to some kind of fantasy world, I assume. And you, Orion... Is that the basic outfit of Agora?                       Orion: Yeah, Idriel suggested that server to me. I didn't give it much thought.                     Alex: Agora... the public server? Why? You could have logged into any of your previous servers and  brought along better gear!                                                                          Orion: Yeah, well, it wouldn't have made any difference. I don't have any cool weapons or armor yet. I just started playing a few days ago.                                                             Alex: What?! Oh my god, I brought a total noob to obtain Calypso... I knew it was a bad idea to tell you about this place.                                                                              Orion: Hey, you wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me. You just knew the name of the server and that Calypso was hidden here.                                                                            Nova: Well, technically I am the one who found a way in, so...                                      Alex: Yeah, that's right. I owe you one, Nova. If we find it, we can share Calypso. We’ll keep it in a bank and use it at our convenience. But if it ever leads to the discovery of a Gem of Doom, it’s every woman for herself.                                                                            Nova: Sounds good, done deal.                                                                       Orion: And what about me?                                                                           Alex: Well yeah, you can use it too, of course. We're a team now... I guess.                        Orion: Nice! So... where's Calypso, Nova?                                                           Alex: Yeah, I was expecting this server to be a temple or a palace with a gigantic chest. Not a     forest where Mr. Tumnus could live.                                                                 Nova: *Nervous laughter* Well, I explored the surroundings a bit while you both were unconscious,   and... There's nothing here. Just... trees.                                                         Alex: What? Nothing?                                                                                Nova: *Nervous laughter* Nada.                                                                      Orion: So... We're completely lost then?                                                            Nova: Um... Kinda. I was so excited to get into this secret server that I forgot to think of a way  to get out.                                                                                         Alex: So we don't even know which way to go?                                                        Nova: I haven’t the faintest idea. But don't worry! If we start walking in a straight path, I'm sure we'll find something! Come on guys, you just gotta put on a brave face! WE'RE NOT GONNA DIE HERE!  LET'S GO!                                                                                           Orion: . . .                                                                                        Alex: . . .                                                                                         Nova: AAAAAAAH, WE'RE GONNA DIE HERE!  This forest is endless! My feet are killing me! We've been   wandering aimlessly in these woods for I don't even know how long. I'm cold, I'm tired, and I'm     thirsty! If I'm the first to die, please don't eat me... I might look like a walking Cheeto, but I  promise you, I do not taste like one...                                                             Alex: The mountain keeps sloping down toward this direction. That looks like our best chance at     finding a river. Once we get there, we'll be able to get our bearings.                              Nova: How the hell do you still have so much energy? I’m on the verge of passing out!               Alex: Well, thanks to all that swimming, I have quite a bit of stamina.                             Nova: Well what about your body temperature? Aren't you cold? You're almost naked!                  Alex: I was at first, but these robes really hold in the heat, even if it doesn't seem like it.     "Elven magic", I guess.                                                                             Nova: Awww, that's so cool. If I'd known that this server was a damn frozen wasteland, I'd have     taken another outfit. Yep. Definitely gonna die here.                                               Orion: *Patting her* Come on, come on, Nova. How can the world’s greatest and cutest hacker die in a random server of Eternum, just because of a little cold weather? That’s not very fitting for you.  Nova: *Giggles* Y-Yeah, I guess you're right. I’ll keep pushing through the pain!                   Orion: And hey, if we don’t find Calypso or an exit portal, I guess someone will end up             disconnecting us in the real world. I know Dalia will, otherwise she’ll have to wash dishes tonight. So nobody here will be dying from hunger or the cold.                                              Alex: Oh, I recommend you not doing that to anyone... like, ever.                                   Orion: Doing what? Disconnecting someone who's playing?                                             Alex: Yeah. That’s a big no-no. They say the abrupt shock can cause nerve damage, leading to        epilepsy or cerebral palsy.                                                                         Nova: There have been cases of people becoming blind or paraplegic after they were forcibly         disconnected during the middle of a game session.                                                   Alex: Those were rare occurrences, yes, and other people have ended up fine after a forced          disconnect, but still... I wouldn't risk it.                                                        Orion: Are you serious? People know about these risks? And they still keep playing? How is that     possible?                                                                                           Alex: Millions of people die worldwide from tobacco and alcohol each year, but both are perfectly   legal and people continue to consume them. Why would this be any different?                         Orion: Fair point... I'm not gonna stop playing because of those risks either.                      Nova: The only way to leave a server without an exit portal, and at the cost of losing your levels  and inventory... is by killing yourself.                                                            Orion: God, I hope it won’t come to that... Do you think Calypso will be protected?                 Nova: Yeah, it's very likely. The other Weapons of Atlas were heavily guarded. Not sure if Hyas was also, but Dione was definitely protected by Praetorians.                                            Orion: Praetorians?! Eternum's "police"? How is that fair? Aren't they immortal?                    Nova: No! They're tougher than most, but they can die just like any other player or AI of Eternum.  The only two people with immunity are Idriel and the Founder himself. Not even the senior managers  of Ulysses are protected. Speaking of which, what's it like to be the daughter of William Bardot,   Alex? Has he ever told you any secrets about the company?                                           Alex: No. He never talks about his job. And... well, we don't even talk to each other anymore, so... I don’t have much of an answer for you.                                                            Nova: Oh... I'm sorry I asked, I didn't know it was a more serious topic.                           Alex: Don't worry, I don't mind. The relationship with my family is... complicated. Orion witnessed that firsthand. Can I ask you a personal question? What happened to your eye? If you don't mind me  asking.                                                                                             Nova: I don't mind at all. Actually, I'm surprised that Orion hasn’t asked me about it yet.         Orion: Well, before all of this, we were pretty much strangers to each other. I thought it would be rude if I asked you point-blank. And then... well, honestly you’re pretty flamboyant so I had       forgotten you were even wearing an eyepatch. I wouldn't say that's your defining trait.             Nova: ...I'm not sure if that was a compliment, but I'll take it as one. Anyway, my left eye is     still there and it works—I’m not blind or anything. Actually, I have better eyesight in my left eye than in my right one. But it's highly sensitive and gets irritated if I remove my patch for longer  than an hour a day.                                                                                 Orion: Really? Even in Eternum?                                                                     Nova: Yep. That's the downside of Eternum's ultra-scan. Physical illnesses like a missing leg, or in my case a sensitive eye, are also carried over into the game.                                      Orion: I guess I’d never really thought about it... That’s actually a little... sad.                Alex: Well, Ulysses isn't really known for its ethical practices and upstanding moral values. They  could probably create something that allowed people with disabilities to play normally. But if it   doesn't make them any money, then why would they? That's all that matters to them.                  Orion: You know, sometimes, I think if Ulysses really... Hmm? What's wrong?                         Alex: A... A village!                                                                               Orion: Oh! Finally!                                                                                 Nova: Thank god! I was just about to accept my fate!                                                Alex: Let's go take a look!                                                                         Orion: Damn... this place is a ghost town. HELLO?                                                   Orion's Echo: Hello...  Hello...  Hello...                                                          Orion: Hmmm... maybe there should be NPCs here, but they haven't been implemented yet. Maybe that's why the server was inaccessible?                                                                    Nova: Like we're playing on an unfinished build of the server?                                      Orion: Yeah, something like that.                                                                   Alex: That house was completely empty. No trace of anyone. No scraps of clothing, no personal       belongings... nothing.                                                                              Nova: Yeah, same thing over here. The stable is empty and completely clean. There haven't been any  horses here in a while.                                                                             Alex: This is weird as fuck. The other Weapons of Atlas were found on servers with impressive       temples. And Calypso is supposed to be hidden inside an empty hut?                                  Orion: Maybe the challenge was to enter the server and find this village.                           Alex: Hmm... I don't know. I think we're missing something.                                         Nova: This house is also empty! Nothing!                                                            Alex: Well, we've reached the end of the village. Nova, go take a look at that house.               Nova: Okay!                                                                                         Alex: Orion, you go to...                                                                           Orion: Hey, what's that?                                                                            Alex: What's what?                                                                                  Orion: There! It's some sort of stone altar with... a box?                                          Alex: No way...                                                                                     Nova: T-This is it! This has to be!                                                                 Orion: Just like that? No guards? No protection?                                                    Alex: I don't know, but someone put this box here for a reason. It has to be something special. It’s gotta be... Calypso.                                                                               Nova: Is it just me, or do you feel it emitting some sort of... negative aura?                      Alex: Yeah, I can feel that too. But at the same time, it feels... calm?                            Orion: So... Calypso, the third Weapon of Atlas, is inside this box? It's rather small... I guess   it's not a lightsaber crossbow like I was hoping.                                                   Alex: The fuck are you talking about? Of course it's not a crossbow. I already told you that Calypso is a code to manipulate servers.                                                                   Orion: Well, yeah, but it still has to be something tangible. I doubt it's gonna be a piece of paper that says: "Hi. Calypso's code is X342-55G. Thanks for playing." It has to be something. It could  have been a reality-manipulator-crossbow, or a dimension-splitting-crossbow, or a crossbow within a crossbow... I don’t know.                                                                           Alex: What’s with you and crossbows? Although... he has a point. It should definitely be            something...                                                                                        Nova: Maybe some kind of wand? Like... a very powerful one? Hyas was a sword, Dione a sniper...     maybe the third weapon is magical.                                                                  Alex: Oh... That actually makes a lot of sense. Maybe a wizard's staff?                             Nova: Mmmm... No, a staff couldn’t fit into that box. Magic gloves?                                 Alex: Could be. Or a bracelet of power.                                                             Nova: Also possible.                                                                                Orion: . . .                                                                                        Alex: Um...                                                                                         Nova: Whoa...                                                                                       Alex: Excuse me, did you just catch an arrow in mid-air?                                            Orion: Uh... it looks like it, yeah.                                                                Alex: You’re saying that as if it’s the most normal thing to do. How the fuck did you do that?      Orion: I don't know... I felt it coming, so I grabbed it.                                           Alex: You felt it coming? What the hell? You were standing with your back toward it! How is that    possible?! Stop bullshitting me!                                                                    Orion: I don't know how! I just did it!                                                             Alex: So you're a ninja with superhuman reflexes now?                                               Orion: Um... maybe my reflexes improved in Eternum. I don't know what you want me to say, really.   Alex: It doesn't work like that. You've only been playing for a few days! What's your compatibility level?                                                                                              Orion: 100%. Oh, maybe that's it.                                                                   Alex: Ha. Ha. Very funny. Come on, seriously.                                                       Orion: I'm not lying, it’s 100%. That's what Idriel told me.                                        Alex: What?? That's impossible. No one's ever gotten 100%. Shit, I don't even know anyone who's over 85%.                                                                                               Orion: Well what’s your compatibility level then?                                                   Alex: 57%.                                                                                          Orion: Really? Only?                                                                                Alex: What do you mean, "only"? That's above average!                                               Orion: I don't know, maybe I misheard her. Is there anywhere I can check my levels and stats?       Alex: You have to connect to the Main Nexus and ask Idriel.                                         Orion: Oh, cool. I have something to ask her next time.                                             Nova: Um... I'm sorry to interrupt, but shouldn't we be investigating where that arrow came from? I doubt another human player managed to access this server, so it has to be an NPC.                   Orion: That's weird, we didn't see anyone in the village.                                           Alex: Hmmm...                                                                                       Orion: Anyway, I think we should open this box and then try to find an exit... H-HOLY SHIT!         Nova: What the fuck?!                                                                               Orion: The arrows... they’re like... frozen!                                                        Alex: Y-Yeah, that was me this time. I created a magical barrier. Looks like we're not alone,       guys...                                                                                             Nova: But who...                                                                                    Orion: No... No, no, no...                                                                          Nova: Who's that?                                                                                   Orion: I've seen this before...                                                                     Praetorian: . . . *Standing up* Eternum IDs 294057751, 301969771, and 421200234. Put your hands up  and surrender at once.                                                                              Orion: Oh shit...                                                                                   Alex: What exactly are we being accused of? We've done nothing wrong!                               Praetorian: You have accessed an unauthorized server. Calypso must not be used yet. Ogygia will     remain off-limits until further notice.                                                             Alex: What? You created the three Weapons of Atlas! We're just playing your damn game and using all methods available to us. There's no rule against that in Eternum's General Code of Ethics. We didn't torture anyone, we didn't rape anyone, and we didn't use the network to traffic illegal content. We haven't broken any laws!                                                                           Praetorian: Your case will be examined by an Ethics Jury. It is not our duty to place judgment upon you. Lower the barrier and accompany me without resistance.                                         Alex: Yeah? Or else what?                                                                           Praetorian: You will be excommunicated.                                                             Orion: W-What?                                                                                      Alex: Fuck no! I won't end up like Benjamin!                                                        Orion: Y-You know about Benjamin?                                                                   Alex: I know enough to suspect that there's something fishy about his case. Ulysses has been        covering up mysterious deaths for years.                                                            Praetorian: It doesn't matter what you believe. You have reached the end of the road. You have      committed a crime and must face the consequences of your actions. Lower the barrier. Resisting will only make things more painful for you.                                                              Alex: F-Fuck!                                                                                       Orion: C-Can't we fight them? There are only three of them!                                         Alex: Look around you, Orion. We are surrounded. The second I remove the barrier, a flood of arrows will rain upon us.                                                                                  Orion: Oh, fuck...                                                                                  Alex: We're fucked...                                                                               Praetorian: Surrender now. This is your last warning.                                               Alex: *Voice breaking* I... I don't wanna die, Orion.                                               Orion: (Shit, I've never seen her so scared...)                                                     Alex: *Voice breaking* They’d just say I had a heart attack swimming or some shit and then forget   all about me.                                                                                       Orion: We’re gonna figure a way out of this, Alex.                                                  Alex: But they’re everywhere!                                                                       Orion: Listen to me, this is not the end. We are not gonna die here.                                Alex: But what can we do?                                                                           Nova: Well... I only see one solution. Because there’s no way in hell I’m dying here either. There's still so much I want to do in this life.                                                           Alex: What? That sniper... I've seen it before... T-That's... Dione! The second Weapon of Atlas!    Nova: I think there’s only 2 Praetorians who are leading the charge. If we get rid of them, the     warriors will lose formation. The other Praetorian is up there, on top of the hill. And she has a   sniper rifle too. She's probably their backup plan.                                                 Praetorian: What? Did she see me from there? Huh, she’s got sharp eyes.                             Nova: I think she's about 480 yards away. Maybe 490. I'd say it's a little hypocritical to accuse us of cheating, only to then use a sniper rifle on a medieval server... don't you think?              Praetorian: Say whatever you want. You're just delaying the inevitable.                             Orion: Y-Y-You have Dione?! But I thought it was owned by a... Delilah Warren, or something!        Nova: *Giggles* Pretty cool name, huh?                                                              Orion: But why?                                                                                     Nova: Have you forgotten? The foundation of a hacker lifestyle is anonymity, Orion. And let's be    honest, Delilah Warren is a lot catchier than Nova Johnson. And Dione is not just a sniper. It can  transform into any kind of ranged weapon. Hmm, but I think I’ll stick with this set-up today. I’m   gonna need it for that Queen of the Hill up there. I'll take care of that one, Alex. Then I’ll deal with the archers in the trees and on the roofs. Can I count on you to kill the other Praetorian     leader?                                                                                             Alex: The other Praetorian...? You can count on me, Nova. I got this bitch.                         Orion: Holy shit, I can't believe it! You have Dione, the weapon whose bullets never miss their     targets! We can win this fight!                                                                     Nova: *Giggles* Sorry Orion, I'm afraid that's only a rumor people have made up. Its real unique    ability is being able to transform into any type of firearm. Also, each bullet is fired with its    cartridge, specially outfitted with tracking capabilities and thus allowing the user to teleport to its location.                                                                                       Praetorian: What? Is she seriously trying to snipe me from there? *Mockingly laughs* Good luck with that. Dione is the weakest of the three for a reason.                                               Orion: Teleport to where its bullets travel? What the hell is the point of that?                    Nova: Well, very few things are faster than a bullet. So with that kind of speed, you can cover     large distances in a matter of seconds, or even make for a quick escape.                            Orion: But... Alex's barrier will break the moment you shoot! If you miss the shot, the other       Praetorian will easily snipe us! She has the high ground! Obi-Wan taught us the importance of that! Nova: Well you know what they say about rumors, Orion? There’s usually a hint of truth to them. In  this case, the one that never misses... isn’t Dione... It's me. . . . 47 shots fired with Dione and 46 confirmed kills. Yeah, I missed a shot once, but don't tell anyone, alright? I have a reputation to uphold.                                                                                          Praetorian: . . .                                                                                   Nova: I hope you don't mind me taking your spot. The view is just gorgeous up here! And please,     don't take it personally. I’m just not ready to die quite yet. I at least have to make it to next   Monday. Luna's father told me he's introducing a new taco to the menu. I’ve been dying to try it... And well, past that... I just made some new friends. We still have a lot of adventures ahead of us. I'm sure you understand. My left eye helps, for sure, but the trick is to control your breathing,   calculate the distance, account for the Coriolis effect, and of course factor in the wind. Never    rush. Take your time. Don’t stiffen up. Stay relaxed. Just keep your eye on the target... ...and    then slowly squeeze the trigger.                                                                    Alex: *Chuckles*                                                                                    Soldier: W-What the fuck?!                                                                          Soldier: She just headshot Mia and Emma!                                                            Praetorian: . . .                                                                                   Alex: You know, it always amazes me to see how you... a fucking computer program... can show such   pure emotion.                                                                                       Praetorian: What?                                                                                   Alex: The look on your face... it was pure terror. I must applaud the great work that Ulysses did   when creating you. You almost look human.                                                           Praetorian: Say whatever you want. Your fate remains the same. Seize her!                           Alex: I think your friends are scared shitless. You should have brought more Praetorians. What's the problem? Storage space getting too expensive for all your buddies?                                 Praetorian: Enough. Your session is to be terminated and you will be excommunicated from the server.Alex: Always the same speech. Maybe you’re due for a software update, or something.                 Praetorian: You do not stand a chance against me.                                                   Alex: We'll see about that... . . .                                                                 Soldier: S-She's a shapeshifter!                                                                    Praetorian: You will regret this... All three of you.                                               Soldier: F-FUCK! RUN!                                                                               Soldier: I told you we should have never accepted this job!                                         Soldier: I didn't even know Praetorians could be killed! At 300 eternals an hour, this was supposed to be the job of a lifetime!                                                                        Soldier: And now we're gonna lose everything we’ve earned in this lifetime! We should’ve just gotten those jobs at Aphrodite’s!                                                                         Soldier: I-It's okay! I think that bitch ran off already! Maintaining that form consumes a great    deal of energy, she probably went to...                                                             Alex: *Crushing her to the ground* *Tail swipe*                                                     Orion: (Oh my fucking god... They're all amazing... Annie, Dalia, Luna, Nova, Alex... They're all   such amazing players... while I’m here being about as useful as bacon at a vegan restaurant.        Alright. It’s time for me to start pulling my weight. From now on, I'll stop being useless. I'll go to the gym every day, study guides online, and play on my own to get experience and good items. I   promise. You owe it to yourself, Orion.)                                                            Nova: Holy shit, she's a shapeshifter! That's so cool!                                              Orion: Nova!                                                                                        Nova: My magic skills are near-zero. I wish I could do something like that.                         Orion: Wow! Your left eye! It's blue!                                                               Nova: Ahhh... y-yeah. I know it must be weird to look at, but I can’t find my patch. S-sorry.       Orion: What are you talking about? I think you look even more beautiful.                            Nova: O-Oh well, thank you.                                                                         Orion: Will there be any negative side-effects for not wearing it?                                  Nova: In the real world, I could lose my eyesight if I remove the patch for more than an hour a day. But in Eternum, luckily that can’t happen. However, I can still get a serious case of dry eye. I’d prefer to avoid that terrible agony...                                                              Orion: Oh... let's get out of here quickly, then!                                                   Alex: OH JESUS CHRIST, WHY IS IT SO FUCKING COLD HERE?! Where the hell did I put my damn elven      robes?!                                                                                             Orion: I think you left them in...                                                                  Alex: Turn around. I dare you. It’ll be the last thing you do!                                      Nova: They're over there, Alex! On that stone.                                                      Alex: Oh, that's right! Thank god... Aaahh... much better...                                        Orion: Girls, where do I even begin?! That fight was incredible. I couldn't believe my eyes. I still can't believe it, actually. When you did that thing, I was like, “WHOA!” And then you did that     other thing, and I was like, “WHOAAAAA!!!” And then... well... You. Two. Are. Amazing.              Nova: Thank you.                                                                                    Alex: Bah.                                                                                          Orion: Alright, we don't know if the Praetorians can signal other AIs across servers, so we should  probably escape while we can. But first... Finally. The Third Weapon of Atlas is ours. Calypso.     Nova: Do you really think the Praetorians were serious about this server not being ready?           Alex: What do you mean?                                                                             Nova: I don't know, maybe everything has been a test. Ulysses is the most powerful company in the   world. If they really wanted to prevent us from getting here, don't you think they would have done  it? Discovering the location of Calypso, running the exploit to access this server, finding the     village, fighting the Praetorians... Maybe it was all part of some sort of challenge.               Alex: I don't know, they've never done anything like that before. I think they were really trying to keep Calypso from us. However big and powerful they are, the Eternum universe is simply too        immense. They can't be everywhere. Maybe we just got here, because... we're good. And we got lucky. Nova: Extremely lucky, I'd say. What if I had missed the shot? What if you hadn't been a            shapeshifter? Shit, what if we had started walking in the opposite direction when we were in the    forest?                                                                                             Alex: I... I don't know. I’d rather not think about it too much. I'll settle for not dying when we  open that box.                                                                                      Nova: D-Do you think it could be a trap? Like an Egyptian curse?                                    Alex: Could be. That's why I'll open it.                                                            Nova: No, no, no. I'll open it. I won't let you die because of me.                                  Ask Alex to open the box                                                                            Orion: I think Alex's right. She should open it.                                                    Alex: See? I'll open it. If I die, you can keep my stuff and...                                     Open the box yourself                                                                               Orion: I didn't do shit during that fight. You guys have so much more to lose than me. If someone   has to die a horrible death by opening that box, I'd rather it be me than any of you.               Alex: Well, I won't object.                                                                         Nova: Thank you, Orion.                                                                             Alex: Yes, thank you.                                                                               Nova: We should...                                                                                  Ask Nova to open the box                                                                            Orion: I think Nova's right. She should open it.                                                    Nova: See?! Thanks, Orion. You discovered this server, so it's only fair. I'll open it, and if I    die... S-Shit! What's going on?!                                                                    Alex: I don't know! Is it... Is it opening?!                                                        Orion: Fuck, I can’t see!! Hmm?
