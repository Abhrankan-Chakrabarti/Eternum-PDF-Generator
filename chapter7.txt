Orion: Do... Do you know who I am?                                                                  William Bardot: I am well aware of your shenanigans, Orion. I know you've been fooling around with  the WRE with your peculiar group of... friends. I know you attacked that fool Clarence and stole his laptop in order to ascertain Thanatos' real identity. And I know you have Calypso... even if you're too stupid to use it properly.                                                                     Orion: “It”? She's not a thing.                                                                     William Bardot: IT is a tool you must use to achieve your goal... same as everyone else. That       foolish, naive mentality of yours is exactly why your progress has come to a screeching halt. The   best thing you could do would be to hand over your Gems to a more skilled veteran player. Someone   who actually understands these rules... so you could stop wasting everyone's time.                  Orion: Hah, someone like yourself, for instance?                                                    William Bardot: I am not looking for the Gems. However, since you asked... Thanatos would be a      better option. He'll grab them from your corpse sooner or later, so... why delay it?                Orion: (Fucking bastard...) If you're not looking for the Gems, why do you even care?               William Bardot: Because someone must stop The Founder. Someone must gather the 10 Gems. Anyone but  him. I won't let him destroy everything I've built.                                                 Orion: The Founder...? (Is this what this is all about? A power struggle? Some pathetic dick        measuring contest?) How are his goals any different from yours?                                     William Bardot: . . . Hmm. I suppose whether or not you're aware of the full backstory won't affect your fate.                                                                                          Orion: Aware of what backstory?                                                                     William Bardot: . . . What I'm about to tell you could reshape society as we know it today. It could lead to revolt and revolution, anger and incredulity, questions of faith and of life’s grand       meaning.                                                                                            Orion: Very dramatic.                                                                               William Bardot: I will only say it once, so pay attention. You might learn something to change that bleeding heart of yours.                                                                            Orion: *Sighs* Enlighten me...                                                                      William Bardot: The Founder... didn't create Eternum. He... discovered it.                          Orion: I'm sorry?                                                                                   William Bardot: The worlds which form Eternum... the desert lands and magical forests and galactic  worlds you prance through... they have always been there.                                           Orion: What...?                                                                                     William Bardot: In the past, many civilizations had even gleaned sight of it, but those fools       believed it to be the afterlife. They didn’t know what we found out... that even the living were    capable of entering Eternum for a short time. Though, unwillingly, in most cases. Usually accidents, dismissed as dreams or mere delusions. Some special ones, though... were capable of entering       Eternum at will. They were known in Eternum as... the Immortals.                                    Orion: (The Immortals? Could these be the same ones Calypso mentioned?)                             William Bardot: The Founder was one of these... chosen ones.                                        You remain silent, in an attempt to process what you're hearing.                                    William Bardot: He was able to synthesize a system that allowed humans lacking this innate          capability access to Eternum. The key to the system was the neural implant, which allowed the       manifestations of astral projections. He crafted Eternum's inventory system, designed the Exit      Portal mechanism, outlined levels, and even established a new commerce system... ostensibly through advanced coding skills. Yet, no one at even Ulysses has ever seen a hint of a source code. He       ensnared the entire world within an intricate web of deception.                                     Orion: (Astral projections? This shit can't be real... Does this mean that Axel was right...?) And  so what about the NPCs?                                                                             William Bardot: The souls of the dead, drawn from the pages of human history. The Founder can       manipulate them and bend their will. Make them dance like puppets.                                  Orion: So... that's it? He's an almighty GOD? He can do anything he wants?                          William Bardot: He's HUMAN. And that's why he needs the Gems.                                       Orion: I thought he created the Gems of Doom himself.                                               William Bardot: He did not. The 10 Gems are the very essence of Eternum itself. They're the         beginning... and the end. They are the conclusion of an order, the perfect and the ultimate. The end of a cycle... and the start of a new one. The one who gathers them all... will transcend the       confines of time and space. Becoming...                                                             Orion: ...a god.                                                                                    William Bardot: The Founder began this quest so people would find the Gems and bring them to him.   The moment someone does that... it'll be too late.                                                  Orion: But... What about Thanatos? He's... dead.                                                    William Bardot: Not all the NPCs are under The Founder's control. Some continue to live their lives, unaware that they have passed into the realm of the soul. Others, like Thanatos, are aware of      Eternum's true nature and pursue the Gems of Doom for their own purposes. The Founder is the only   man who knows how to harness the power of the Gems of Doom. That makes him the most dangerous out of anyone in the hunt. It would mean... our end.                                                      Orion: (What the fuck... We already knew this was bigger than we thought at first, but... holy fuck, I'm gonna need some time to process all this information.) How many servers are there, then?       William Bardot: There's an uncountably infinite number of them. But only a handful are controlled by The Founder. If there's no Exit Portal, a common human has no way to access it.                    Orion: But then why–                                                                                Alex: *Entering the room* Okay, done.                                                               Orion: Huh...? Alex!                                                                                Alex: I signed it. Now get the fuck out of my house.                                                William Bardot: Ah... I almost forgot the original reason I came here. Did you read it all?         Alex: I read enough.                                                                                William rises from his seat and strides towards Alex. She attempts to maintain her composure, but   it's clear that she cannot bring herself to meet her father's gaze.                                 William Bardot: Do you understand all the implications of that document?                            Alex: You’ve disowned me. Didn’t take a genius to see that coming.                                  William Bardot: It's not just that. From this moment forward, you're no longer a Bardot. You have no tie to us. No property, no riches, no will. You don’t even have the name Bardot anymore. There will be nothing linking you to this family. You're an outcast now. A pariah. Do you understand?         Alex: Like I said, disowned. Completely.                                                            William Bardot: Tell me then, will your shitty job cover the costs of your education? Your swimming tutor? Your rent? Healthcare? Another whorish tattoo?                                               Alex: . . .                                                                                         William Bardot: Hmph. You're such a haughty brat. Always projecting this air of independence and    sanctimony... but in the end, that was all just a disguise, eh, Alexandra? Still just an arrogant   child who knows nothing about how the world works.                                                  You notice Alex clenching her fist, her shoulders slowly shaking.                                   William Bardot: You've always been a disappointment, Alexandra. A burden.                           You suddenly stand up, rage consuming you in response to William's hurtful words.                   Orion: . . .                                                                                        William's henchmen remain motionless with their hands firmly on their firearms. It is clear that    they would be ready to react to even the slightest provocation.                                     Orion: (F-Fuck, I shouldn't do anything stupid...)                                                  You look at Alex, her eyes quietly imploring your inaction in the face of her father’s verbal abuse.Orion: (She doesn't want me to get involved.)                                                       William Bardot: Anyway... I've already wasted more time here than I would have liked, and this is   going to be a very long night. Farewell, Alexandra. This is the last time we'll see each other.     Alex: Fuck off.                                                                                     William Bardot: Do you have any final questions?                                                    Alex: . . . Does Mother know about this?                                                            William Bardot: Know...? It was her idea.                                                           William and his men leave the house, leaving Alex standing by the door, her gaze fixed on the floor in solemn silence.                                                                                  Orion: (What a fucking son of a bitch... He's a total monster. I don't even know if I should believe the things he just said to me. He must have some sort of plan. Although... if he wanted the Gems   for his own use, he wouldn't have revealed himself like this. That wouldn't make sense. Might it be that he wants just anyone to gather the 10 Gems? Simply to take down The Founder?)                  Alex: *Sniffs*                                                                                      Orion: (Fuck, poor Alex. I don't even know what to say...) Hey...                                   Alex: I'm sorry you had to see this... again.                                                       Orion: Don't say that! Fuck William. You don–                                                       Alex: I really need to be alone right now. Thank you for coming, Orion.                             Orion: But...                                                                                       Alex: I'll see you Monday at school. If... I'm still allowed to attend after this disownment fiasco. I'll have to look into that.                                                                       Leave her alone                                                                                     Orion: *Sighs* Okay... I understand. Promise me that if you need someone to talk to, or if you      need... anything at all, you'll give me a call.                                                     Alex: *Sniffs* Okay, okay, I promise.                                                               Orion: (She was crying...) Are you absolutely sure you don't want me to stay?                       Alex: Yeees, I'm sure. You've done enough for today.                                                Orion: Well, alright... I'll trust your judgment.                                                   Alex: And besides... who needs you when I have Dr. Eggdogstein.                                     Orion: *Laughs* Ah, I knew you liked it!                                                            Alex: I'm starting to believe he's the secret to my quick recovery.                                 Orion: Told you. He'll protect you against all illnesses.                                           Alex: *Chuckles* Let's hope so. Thank you for coming, Orion. Tonight was... really special. In many ways.                                                                                               Orion: It was very special to me too. Are you su–                                                   Alex: Yes, I am suuure. Now get the fuck out of my house already! You can take my umbrella.         Orion: *Chuckles* Okay, okay. See you tomorrow, then.                                               Alex: Sure. Have a good night. And... thanks again, Orion. For everything.                          Orion: Don't even mention it. Good night, Alex.                                                     Hug her                                                                                             Without uttering a word, you simply grab Alex and pull her into a hug before she has a chance to    respond.                                                                                            Alex: . . .                                                                                         She slowly encircles her arms around you as tears begin to stream down her cheeks.                  Orion: You don't really have a say in who your parents or family are. But you do get to choose your friends. And I promise... you'll never be alone again.                                              Alex stays silent, her body telling you everything you need to know as she continues to cry on your shoulder.                                                                                           Alex: . . . *Sniffing* Mmph! *Clears throat* W-Well, that was... a m-moment of weakness. I'm sorry. Orion: Don't worry, I won't tell anyone you cried in front of me. I think that makes it the second  time, doesn't it? I must be hitting a soft spot with you, admit it.                                 Alex: *Chuckles* Yeah, I guess so. Or... maybe it's because you always seem to show up when troubles do. You bring bad luck.                                                                            Orion: *Chuckles* I can't deny that's also a possibility.                                           Alex: Hmph. Thank you for everything, Orion. Tonight was... really special. In many ways.           Orion: It was very special to me too. One that'll be hard to forget. Now come on, let's watch some  more of those boring swimming competitions so I can fall asleep!                                    Alex: Hey! They’re not that boring.                                                                 Orion: Be real! I saw you starting to snore during that Phelps compilation.                         Alex: *Chuckles* Fair enough. But just so you know, tomorrow morning, you're out as soon as the sun peeks over the horizon.                                                                             Orion: Sounds like a plan to me! I can–                                                             Alex: Orion. Enough. I... I appreciate it, but I told you I need to be alone. This is not your      concern.                                                                                            Orion: *Sighs* Okay... I understand. Take care, Alex. Please. Promise me that if you need anything  at all you'll give us a call.                                                                       Alex: I'll be okay. This isn't my first rodeo around Bardot family drama.                           Orion: Alright then... goodbye, Alex. (I hope she'll be okay... But if she needs some time alone, I need to give her that. Hopefully she'll feel better tomorrow... Oh boy, it's gonna be a long way    home...)                                                                                            Alex: So... what did my father say to you while I was outside signing that shit?                    Orion: Oh... You might want to take a seat for this...                                              Alex: I'm back! *Leaving her things on the table* Girl, you won't believe this! Mr. Kellegan told me he talked to some folks, and... I can keep training with him! He said that since I show so much    potential, I can continue attending the... Huh? You're still playing Eternum?! I left literally 4   hours ago! Well, it’s your loss... I bought some handmade chocolate from the store you like! I guess I'll have to eat it all on my own! Eh?? No?                                                        Dalia: . . .                                                                                        Alex: Damn, if food can't wake you up from your slumber, nothing will. *Taking her boots off* I     guess I'll have to chill until you're done playing. You'd better come back with a new Gem or        something at least! *Lying down next to Dalia* I really shouldn't have let you stay all alone with  the Eternum gear around. What about our plans for the day? You're really lucky you can't hear me    right now, or you'd be in for a valuable lesson! Hmph. I'm pampering you, you know? Like, this is   special treatment. I've never let anyone stay at my place alone before. Not even Orion! And I... I  let him do a lot of things that night, believe me. (A lot...) But not staying alone in my apartment! Not that... . . . *Whispering* I mean... jeez, can you believe we actually had sex?! *Whispering*  Because I definitely can't. *Whispering* That was CRAZY! *Clears throat* Although... Well, that was just... something that happened. That's all. We're not in a relationship or anything. . . .         However... Sometimes, if I imagine him with someone else, I get... kinda... jealous? Does that...   does that mean something? Like... it's not anything serious, but... I don't want to share him       either, you know? Unless I shared him with my best friend, of course... Can you imagine? Orion, you, and me... sharing a bottle of booze... And then... *Snorts* Don't worry, I'm kidding, I'm kidding! I'm just kidding. I'm only... messing around. I should really stop talking to myself. One day       someone will catch me and they'll think I'm nuts. Don't say anything, eh, Dalia?                    Dalia: . . .                                                                                        Alex: *Chuckles* And that day it was raining like crazy. I even felt kind of bad. You're all turning me into a big ol’ softie. With all your kindness, and your selfless acts... Lately, I feel like    I've been nicer to other people because of you too. Yep, I don't like that, Dalia. *Chuckles* Not   one bit...                                                                                          Dalia: . . . Aaah... AAAaaaaahhh... *Sneezes* Ah-choo! *Sniffs* Ugh, these fumes are getting up in  my nose.

Dalia: I haven't!                                                                                   Eradicator AXR-110: Are you currently experiencing nausea or abdominal pain?

The robot continues its patrol along the street, humming a cheerful tune.                           Dalia: Jesus, that was close...

Dalia: I thought I was about to be blasted for a second.                                            Informant: I know, right? They say the Xenomorph epidemic has gotten out of hand, so Ulysses decided to take drastic measures. And instead of releasing a fucking software patch, they deployed these   damn robots everywhere to ruin all the fun and scare away my customers. FUCK YOU, PIGS! But anyway, what were we talking about?                                                                         Dalia: El Coyote. You mentioned that you knew where his base was hidden.                            Informant: Ah, yeah... Emphasis on was hidden, I guess. Now he’s probably moved on to one of the    hundreds of abandoned warehouses you can find throughout Ion. Sorry. The guy's a touch paranoid when it comes to staying hidden.                                                                        Nancy: Agh, so the reports were right... we're too late.                                            Informant: Yeah, apparently he arrived two days ago very agitated and demanded everybody pack up and leave.                                                                                             Nancy: Damn it... he's slipped through our fingers again. Any idea about where he could have gone?  Informant: No clue. People used to say he frequented Frontier Trails, so maybe you'll get lucky     looking there.                                                                                      Nancy: Nah... we've been there already. And I doubt he'd return. Dammit... he keeps eluding us.     Bastard.                                                                                            Dalia: He's running out of places to hide, though. It's gotta be The New World.                     Nancy: Yeah... I was waiting to gather some info before heading there personally. I sent some men to explore the area in advance.                                                                       Informant: Welp, I guess my job here is done. And now that that's settled... Hear me out: CIRCUIT   EDGE. The ultimate nightclub in all of Ion! Music, cool people, and the best Braindances you'll ever see! Two free drinks each! I've got coupons! What do you say?                                      Nancy: Um... I can't, I'm busy today.                                                               Informant: Aghh... come on, after being a WRE informant for so long? I work on commission, lend me a hand!                                                                                              Nancy: I'm sorry, maybe another day.                                                                Informant: I'll take your word for it... What about your sister? You up, cutie? You'll have fun, I  promise!                                                                                            Dalia: Nah, I'm sorry, I also– Hold up a second... w-what did you just say?                         Informant: Yep, TWO free drinks!                                                                    Dalia: Not that! Do you... do you think we're sisters?!                                             Informant: Oh... are you not? My bad, it's just that you two look a lot alike.                      Dalia: We look alike because we're family, but NOT sisters! How old do we think we are?!            Informant: Ehh... Well, if I had to guess, I'd say she's... 28? 29?                                 Nancy: Oh please, stop it! You should see me without makeup on...                                   Informant: And you look like... 23?                                                                 Dalia: WHAT?! You think there's only a 5-year difference between us?!                               Informant: Younger? Sorry, I'm not good at this. I think it's the jacket, it makes you look o–      Dalia takes off her jacket and tosses it to the ground.                                             Informant: Uh... Mmm... Um... ...22?                                                                Dalia: . . .                                                                                        Informant: No? 21...?                                                                               Dalia: *Gritting her teeth* MMMmmmmmhhh...                                                          Nancy: *Clears throat* Anyway, thank you for your help.                                             Informant: Anything for the WRE. Tell the Empress I helped you!                                     Nancy: Yeah, will do... thank you. Okay, we're almost done here, Dalia. I'm gonna investigate that  warehouse before logging off, I wanna see if I can find any clues about Coyote. I know you had plans with Alex, so feel free to log off, no worries.                                                    Dalia: Mm-hm.                                                                                       Nancy: . . . Are you okay?                                                                          Dalia: Hmm.                                                                                         Nancy: You sure?                                                                                    Dalia: Hmm.                                                                                         Nancy: Aaaahhh... I know what's going on. It's because of a boy, isn't it?                          Dalia: What? W-Where did that come from? I don't even know what you're talking about.               Nancy: You've never cared about what others think of you, let alone some random informant. But      something's changed lately... A mother notices these things.                                        Dalia: Stop it. You’re talking nonsense, Mom.                                                       Nancy: Ah, young love... my little princesses grew up too fast!                                     Dalia: I told you to stop making things up.                                                         Nancy: So there's no secret boyfriend you're trying to keep from me?                                Dalia: Of course not.                                                                               Nancy: Nothing serious, then? A no-strings-attached relationship? Just sex?                         Dalia: Mom! Please!                                                                                 Nancy: Make sure he uses protection! Or if you'd like, I can go with you to the pharmacy to get some birth control pills! I’m sure old Ms. Shirley at the pharmacy would be discreet!                   Dalia: NO! D-Don’t tell Ms. Shirley! I... o-oh my god, can we stop talking about this, please?!     You’re embarrassing me!                                                                             Nancy: You can talk to your mommy about these things, darling, it's perfectly natural.              Dalia: I do NOT want to talk about these things.                                                    Nancy: That's okay hun, I'll meet him whenever you're ready. We’ll go at your pace. I’m sure things are steamy and physical now, but when things calm down, I’ll be there for you!                      Dalia: I TOLD YOU I'M NOT SLEEPING WITH ANYONE! So please, STOP TALKING ABOUT IT!                   Nancy: Oh... so there's someone, but you're not there yet. Is that it?                              Dalia: It's not like... I... He...                                                                  Nancy: I see... Don't worry, I won't push further. I just want you to know you can talk to me       whenever you want. About anything.                                                                  Dalia: A-Alright.                                                                                   Nancy: And I won't breathe a word to anyone, rest assured.                                          Dalia: Hmm. Not even Penny.                                                                         Nancy: My lips are sealed! Mmmh?                                                                    Dalia: Hmmm.                                                                                        Nancy: . . .                                                                                        Penelope: Mmmmh... *Scrolling through her Instagram feed* (Orion still hasn't liked my latest pic... Although... well, I guess we've all been crazy busy lately. I've barely had time for any modeling  stuff myself. Just college and Eternum. Yeah, he probably just missed it.) Hmm. . . . (He used to be on top of liking my pics, though. I remember he even had post notifications on... Did something... happen? Is he mad at me? Did I say something, maybe...?) Hmm... (Bah, I'm totally overthinking this. You seriously can't let this nonsense get to you, Penny. Don't be in your head. He probably just   didn’t see it, that's all.) Mm-hm. (Yeah.) . . . (Maybe it's because of the pants I'm wearing in    this pic? Now that I look at them... they do make my hips look kinda weird.)                        Lily: Penny!                                                                                        Penelope: (Are those hip dips...? Or is it the angle?)                                              Lily: PENNY!                                                                                        Penelope: (Do I even have hip dips?? Since when?)                                                   Lily: *Clapping her hands* PENNY!!!                                                                 Penelope: W-What, what?! Jeez, don't shout!                                                         Lily: Marco’s got some goodies to spill!                                                            Penelope: Oh, y-yeah, the surprise he mentioned. I'm all ears.                                      Marco: Okay... remember when we said we deserved a good long break after last week's media law test?Lily: Ugh, don't even remind me! That was so brutal!                                                Penelope: Yeah... (Was it? I pulled an A without sweating it much.) ...it was a tough one. Thank    goodness I put in some serious study time.                                                          Marco: Well... me and Sebastian have been secretly plotting a little surprise. We're throwing a     party tomorrow... AT HIS PARENTS’ HOUSE!                                                            Lily: *Gasps* No way! At Sebastian's place?!                                                        Penelope: The chalet?! Really? How did he manage to pull that off?                                  Marco: His parents are both out of town until next Monday. So Sebs and I put our heads together to  plan the bash of the year. We're even bringing in our very own DJ!                                  Lily: *Gasps* Our own DJ?!                                                                          Marco: And a pool...                                                                                Lily: A POOL?!                                                                                      Marco: Unlimited bar...                                                                             Penelope: No way!                                                                                   Marco: A huge dance floor with music blaring...                                                     Penelope: Whoa!                                                                                     Marco: It’s gonna be a full-out spectacle!                                                          Penelope: You're kidding!                                                                           Marco: We've invited people from all over the state!                                                Penelope: Oh my!                                                                                    Marco: And there will be plenty of spare rooms in case anyone wants to... sleep over...             Penelope: OH MY GOD! Ahh, I wish I could make it! Promise you'll send me lots of videos!            Marco: There will also be– W-Wait, what? You're not coming?                                         Penelope: Tomorrow, right? Nah, I have some other things to do, sorry. Next time!                   Lily: WHAT?! B-But this is THE party of the year! You HAVE to be there!                             Penelope: I'm sorry, I just... have better plans.                                                   Lily: Better? What could possibly be better than this?!                                             Penelope: Uhh... well, there are quite a few things that come to mind. But... to be honest, I just  don’t feel like partying anymore. Didn't we just have that costume party not too long ago?          Lily: The Halloween one? That was over a month ago!                                                 Penelope: Really? Damn, it feels like yesterday... *Sighs* I guess my partying days are already     behind me. *Melancholy tone* We're not 20 anymore, Lily...                                          Lily: We're literally 21!                                                                           Penelope: Well, either way, I can't make it. I swear. Today I'm playing Eternum until... midnight,  probably. Tomorrow evening, I managed to get an appointment at the Photo Studio with Orion. I       haven’t done any modeling in forever, I need to get back into it. And after that... I'm meeting up  with Alex and my sister to play again.                                                              Lily: WHAT?! Pause. Eternum?! You too?? Are you serious?                                            Penelope: Yes...?                                                                                   Lily: That's like... so... nerdy.                                                                   Penelope: It's not nerdy.                                                                           Lily: It is!                                                                                        Penelope: Are you calling 80% of the campus a nerd? Because everyone there plays it.                Lily: You're like my brother! And he's definitely a total nerd!                                     Penelope: You're just saying that because you haven't given it a try. And besides... Who gives a    shit? We’re in COLLEGE. We’re ADULTS. Who cares what others say? If playing Eternum makes me a nerd or whatever, so be it. It's not like it's gonna make me stop anyway.                                Penelope grabs her shopping bags and stands up, catching the attention of everyone around her in the mall.                                                                                              Penelope: Anyways, I've gotta go! It was fun hanging out with you guys! See you around campus       tomorrow!                                                                                           Lily: S-Sure, bye Penny. Hah! Can you believe it? Penelope Carter plays Eternum!                    Marco: I mean... didn't she mention it before? When we asked her about her Lady of Eternum costume? And... several times after that?                                                                    Lily: Well, yeah, but I thought she was joking. Do you think this is why we've been seeing her less these past few weeks?                                                                               Marco: I guess so. They say it can be quite addicting. Ulysses even opened a store in this mall just a few weeks ago. Honestly... I was thinking about getting an implant myself just to see what all   the fuss is about.                                                                                  Lily: Huh. Might even be worth it. I mean... if Penelope plays it too, it's gotta be at least worth checking out... right? I might swing by that store one of these days too.                           Marco: Yeah... me too. Perhaps.                                                                     Lily: Hmm.                                                                                          Marco: Mmmh.                                                                                        Lily: . . .                                                                                         Marco: . . . Wanna go now?                                                                          Lily: YES!                                                                                          Nova: *Taking a deep breath* . . . *Exhaling* Fuuu.... O-Okay, I'm honestly a bit nervous, but...   I-I need to get this off my chest. I c-can't hold it in any longer. *Nervous chuckle* I know that we met in quite a bizarre situation, and... W-Well, a lot has happened since then. We've been thrust  into tons of even stranger situations. Like... I mean... We've actually done... more than we        probably should have done. Always... forced by some external circumstance. So I don't really know if you feel the same way towards... I mean, some time ago, I started to see you like... *Clears       throat* I guess that w-what I'm trying to say is that... I invited you here today because... I... I want to be with you. I want to take our relationship to the next level. I... I want you. God, no,   that sounds so cringy. I like you. I like you a lot. I want to–                                     Sandra: *Knocking on the door* Nova? Is your friend already here? Or are you talking alone again?   Nova: T-There's no one, Mom! I'm just... singing!                                                   Sandra: It's okay, honey, he doesn't need to hide!                                                  Nova: I-I told you he's coming on Saturday, not today!                                              Sandra: Oh, right! I'll prepare some food!                                                          Nova: I'll handle the food myself!                                                                  Sandra: Oh, okay. Then I'll take your father for a walk so you can have some time alone, don't      worry.                                                                                              Nova's Dad: *From the living room* What?! *From the living room* No chance, I'm staying here. And I want that door open at all times, Nova!                                                             Sandra: Shut up, Rory! I'll stop bothering, sweetie. Keep singing!                                  Nova: Mm-hm. *Kneeling down* (Tsk, when will they stop treating me like a kid?!) *Turning on the    light* (I'm not a child anymore...) *Sighs* This date with Orion has to be PERFECT, Pochita.        Perfect! *Deep exhale* . . . (Okay, mental rundown of the plan. Orion arrives as arranged. We enjoy some pirate-themed snacks, like a shot of rum and those Devil Fruits I ordered online. Afterwards,  we log into Eternum, teaming up with Nancy on The New World server to really get into the pirate    mood. We log off, and I present him with a manga drawing in the style of One Piece, followed by us  enjoying some of the best anime moments together. And to cap it off, we watch the final episode     LIVE... snuggled up together.) *Giggles* (And after that... we'll see. Netflix and chill.) Mmmh.    (Sounds like a solid plan. I swear, if anything goes wrong, I'm gonna die. I've gotta make sure I   don't forget anything. The snacks, the drinks, the Eternum suit, the video recaps, the–) NO.        *Looking at her desk* THEY'RE NOT THERE! FUCK, FUCK, FUCK! *Hyperventilating* I left my drawing     utensils at the Carter house last time I was there! *Hyperventilating* How am I supposed to draw    without them?! *Hyperventilating* NO, NO, NO... MY DATE IS RUINED! *Hyperventilating* I... W-Wait,  I'm supposed to meet Annie for coffee at the cafe in half an hour. Maybe she's still at home, and   she can bring them to me. This way I could still start drawing tonight as I planned. Come on, pick  up, please, pick up... . . . *Hyperventilating* Come on...                                          Annie: Hi!                                                                                          Nova: Annie, thank goodness! Listen, are you still at home?! Last time I was there I forgot–        Annie: Your drawing utensils? No worries, I'm already at the bus stop, but I have them with me. I   can give them to you at the cafe when we see each other in a bit.                                   Nova: *Regaining a normal pulse rate* Oh my god... You're the absolute best, thank you so much.     (Phew, I almost had a heart attack. I haven’t been so nervous about something since I lost my       laptop...)                                                                                          Annie: Are you okay? You sound agitated.                                                            Nova: Yeah, I'm fine! It's just that I needed them to... um... draw something for my mother. It's   her birthday soon, and I've planned an entire day with her. I want everything to be perfect. Looking back at it, I was probably overreacting, but... you know. I guess I can be a bit neurotic          sometimes.                                                                                          Annie: Oh, that's nice! And I can understand, I'm a perfectionist too. I need all the details to be perfect.                                                                                            Nova: Exactly! I need it to be ready before this Saturday. I wanna draw something in the style of   One Piece. You know, because of the final episode.                                                  Annie: This Saturday? You didn't hear?                                                              Nova: Hear?                                                                                         Annie: The animation studio went on strike for better worker rights, demanding bathroom breaks, an  extra vacation day, regular family visits, and only 12-hour work days! Looks like the episode will  be delayed in the meantime.                                                                         Nova: De...layed?                                                                                   Annie: Yeah, the finale will be delayed by a couple of weeks, at least! So you’ll have plenty of    time to work on–                                                                                    Nova: A couple of–                                                                                  Annie: . . . (She hung up?)                                                                         Orion: *Stretching* Mmmm... (If the barista takes much longer, we won’t have any time for our       drinks. We're supposed to meet Penny in Ekabar in about an hour.)                                   Your phone buzzes.                                                                                  Orion: (Ah, right on cue! I'm pumped to check out that mysterious town. Although... I don't know    much about what's going on there, I only heard about it yesterday. I should ask Luna for the deets  before we all log in.)                                                                              Clerk: Hi cutie! I'm sorry for the wait, my partner couldn't make it to work today, so it's just me. What can I get you?                                                                                Orion: *Standing up* No worries, I just got here.                                                   Clerk: Well, if I knew a handsome fellow like you was waiting for me, I'd have hurried out sooner!  Orion: *Chuckles* You always compliment me to try to get me to spend more money, Ruth.              Clerk: Oh, come on now! It's a heartfelt compliment!                                                Orion: *Chuckles* Whatever. In any case, I'm actually not alone this time. I came with the brunette outside.                                                                                            Clerk: Oh, really...? Hah, that makes sense. I saw her before, she looks like a doll. It's a bit    unfair when all you pretty people gather in one place, you know?                                    Orion: *Chuckles* You can stop the flattery, I'm ordering something anyway.                         Clerk: Ah, you're in luck then, because we have an offer for pretty couples today. Two drinks and   fresh croissants for only $19.95.                                                                   Orion: $20?! (And that's supposed to be a deal?)                                                    Clerk: You won't regret it.                                                                         Orion: Jeez, I hope not...                                                                          Clerk: So, what'll it be? Coffee, tea, or hot chocolate?                                            Orion: I'll have a... coffee. With milk.                                                            Clerk: And for your little angel outside?                                                           Orion: Hmm... (What will Luna want?)                                                                Coffee                                                                                              Orion: Another coffee.                                                                              Tea                                                                                                 Orion: A tea.                                                                                       Hot chocolate                                                                                       Orion: Hot chocolate. Um... I don't know, another coffee, I guess?                                  Clerk: Coming right up!                                                                             Orion: Thanks! I'll take it myself to the table, no worries. (Shit, I'm still overdrawn. Ulysses    sent me an email telling me I have 14 days to fix this or I'll be banned. I've gotta be careful.)   *Sitting down* Sorry for the delay! (Man, the clerk was actually right. She really does look like an angel with this light.) I grabbed us a little something to eat before leaving.                     Luna: You didn't have to.                                                                           Orion: Nonsense. There's a couple of croissants for each of us, and I wasn't sure of what drink you wanted, so I got you a cup of coffee. There's a couple of croissants for each of us, and I wasn't   sure of what drink you wanted, so I got you some hot tea. There's a couple of croissants for each of us, and I wasn't sure of what drink you wanted, so I got you a cup of hot chocolate. Is that okay? Luna: . . . It's perfect! Thank you so much.                                                        Orion: *Taking a sip of your coffee* Don't mention it!                                              Luna: . . .                                                                                         Orion: You're not drinking?                                                                         Luna: I will... in a minute. It seems to be scalding hot, I don't wanna burn my tongue.             Orion: Ah, that makes sense.                                                                        Luna snatches her cup with lightning speed and takes a deep whiff.                                  Orion: *Chuckles* I'll take that as a yes.                                                          Luna: *Taking a sip* I love chocolate.                                                              Orion: I had a feeling you did. You strike me as a chocolate girl.                                  Luna: I don't even like coffee or tea that much, actually.                                          Orion: Really?                                                                                      Luna: Yeah, I know it's kinda odd, considering my dad runs a cafe. But... I don't know, they're just too bitter for my taste. Unless I add a lot of sugar.                                              Orion: Guess I made the right choice then.                                                          Luna: *Taking another sip* You did. Thank you, Orion.                                               Orion: Please, don't even mention it. *Looking at her book* Oh, I forgot to ask you earlier, what   are you reading?                                                                                    Luna: Oh... it's just some old mystery novel I found in my attic.                                   Orion: What's the story about?                                                                      Luna: Um... It's essentially about a girl who inherits an old house in a remote town, and... things happen. It has its share of eerie and mysterious moments.                                           Is that all?                                                                                        Orion: Is that all? It sounds pretty cliche, to be honest.                                          Luna: I guess the premise does sound basic, but there are definitely some intriguing twists and     turns later on. It might not revolutionize anything, but I have a fondness for horror stories.      Cool                                                                                                Orion: Cool. Enjoy it!                                                                              Luna: Thanks! I definitely will. I have a fondness for horror stories.                              Tell me more                                                                                        Orion: You can't stop there! Tell me more!                                                          Luna: I didn't want to bore you with it.                                                            Orion: Nonsense! You could never bore me.                                                           Luna: Well... if you insist... Okay then! It tells the story of a girl called Ivy. After the death  of her grandmother, she inherits an old house and travels to a remote town to assess the value of   the land before selling it.                                                                         Orion: Mm-hm.                                                                                       Luna: The once-grand manor is eerily preserved, but there's something that quickly disturbs her...  Its halls are populated by a haunting congregation of lifelike, grotesque statues, all carved from  obsidian stone. They depict twisted scenes of suffering and despair, each one more macabre than the last. As Ivy explores the mansion, the statues' expressions seem to shift, their sinister grins     deepening, their eyes becoming harrowed. One night, while following faint whispers that reverberate through the corridors, she stumbles upon a statue that disturbingly resembles her dead grandmother, etched in agonized detail. Reaching her limit, Ivy quickly packs her things and races towards the   small town nestled near the station, only to find...                                                Orion: *Gulps*                                                                                      Luna: More statues. Standing sentinels in every corner. On every bench. In every window. There's not a living soul in the town. She begins to retreat, panicked, when suddenly, someone... or something grabs her shoulder and whispers in her ear...                                                       Orion: W-What does it whisper...?                                                                   Luna: That would be a spoiler! I only described the first 3 chapters of the book.                   Orion: H-Holy shit... that was scary, but so cool at the same time! You have such a way with words, Luna. I need to know what comes next.                                                               Luna: I can lend you the book after I'm done, if you want. There are tons of them at home – I have a fondness for horror stories.                                                                       Orion: I like them too, although I'll admit that I don't read anymore.                              Luna: I’m the same, between Eternum and the constant lure of our phones and PCs, I just don’t have  time to read. I'm trying to make it a habit to read at least one book every month.                  Orion: That's a very good decision! That's a very good de– Wait a second... your hands! You're not  wearing your gloves!                                                                                Luna: *Dropping the croissant* Oh... yeah, I know. It's just you and me here, so... I felt...       comfortable enough to take them off.                                                                Orion: Ah, I'm so glad to hear that! I want you to feel safe when you're with me.                   Luna: *Looking at her hand* I don't want to carry shame for what my hands do anymore. I don't want  to be afraid of myself.                                                                             Grab her hand Don't grab her hand                                                                   Orion: You have no reason to be. This power of yours, we'll learn to control it together. We'll all be there for you. You don't have to fear it anymore.                                                Luna: Thank you, Orion. I... I do feel safe when I'm with you. I...                                 Annie: Oh, and add a couple of cookies too, please!                                                 Orion: *Gently grabbing her hand* You have no reason to be.                                         Luna struggles to maintain her composure, her body trembling slightly at your touch.                Orion: This power of yours, we'll learn to control it together. We'll all be there for you. You     don't have to fear it anymore. Your visions could even help us on our quest!                        Luna: Hmph. But... what if I foresee bad things?                                                    Orion: Then we'll try our best it to prevent whatever you saw. You can warn us!                     Luna: It can't be avoided. Whatever I see... it will happen.                                        Orion: It may happen. But our destinies are not written in stone anywhere.                          Luna: But you don’t get it... the things I see... they always come to pass.                         Orion: You also believed that you always had visions of the future when touching anyone with your   bare hands. Yet, when you touched me... nothing happened. That was a first. Why would this be any   different?                                                                                          Luna: Hmm. You're right, that did happen... I guess you have a point.                               Orion: Don't worry, Luna. I'll always be there for you.                                             Luna: . . . I...                                                                                    Annie: Oh, and add a couple of cookies too, please! Hi guys!                                        Luna: A-Annie! So good to see you!                                                                  Orion: (I guess she's not ready to share her secret with anyone else for now. Part of me wishes she would, but I can't deny that it makes me feel somewhat special.)                                    Luna: Annie! I didn't know you were coming.                                                         Annie: I'm meeting up with Nova here in a minute, but since I knew you guys were here, I decided to arrive a couple of minutes early to say hi. And let me say, I LOVE your top!                        Luna: Thank you! Penny picked it out for me when we went to the mall the other day.                 Annie: *Sitting down* Ah, you couldn't have a better stylist than her! That color looks absolutely  stunning on you.                                                                                    Orion: Well, I don’t want to be the only one without a compliment, but I have to say, I absolutely  love your hair, Annie. Those braids are...                                                          Orion's intrusive thoughts: (Imagine getting Annie on all fours and pulling her from those...)      Orion: T-Those braids are adorable. (Orion, don't you start...)                                     Annie: Thank you, Orion... Thanks, I like them too.                                                 Luna: Now I feel kind of bad for having to leave.                                                   Annie: Don't be! Nova is going to be here any minute now, so no worries. And besides, I already knew you were about to leave. You're going to Ekabar, right?                                            Luna: Yeah, Penny, Orion, and me. We're going to a small village called Hollowbrook, where there    have been reports of NPCs going rogue.                                                              Orion: Rogue how? What do we know about it?                                                         Luna: Only that some villagers have been acting strangely lately. Apparently, they've suddenly      started hunting down anyone, be it a player or another NPC, who uses magic, claiming it's the work  of the devil. There have even been reports of them burning people alive, accusing them of vampirism or witchcraft.                                                                                      Orion: Hmm, it's oddly fitting for a medieval server, isn't it?                                     Annie: It might be, but that's not the expected behavior for NPCs in Ekabar. Everyone is allowed to use magic there, so this conduct is entirely irrational.                                            Orion: Interesting... Do you think we'll learn anything about how to free the NPCs from Ulysses'    influence?                                                                                          Annie: I certainly hope so!                                                                         Luna: I was already disturbed by how poorly people treated NPCs sometimes, but after what Orion     discovered from Alex's father the other day... even more so.                                        Annie: We've gotta save them! We have to gather the 10 Gems and liberate the NPCs from... whatever  Eternum is!                                                                                         Orion: You can say that again! Are you sure you don't want to join us, Annie?                       Annie: An eerie village in the middle of nowhere, inhabited by menacing dwellers who murder magic   users? No, thank you. I've already had my fill of frights for this week.                            Orion: *Laughs* Fair enough. Welp, ready to go, Luna? Penny texted me that she was heading home as  well.                                                                                               Luna: Sure thing! Let's not keep her waiting. *Standing up* It was nice seeing you, Annie. Tell Nova I said hello.                                                                                      Annie: Will do!                                                                                     Orion: Huh...?!                                                                                     Luna abruptly withdraws her hand, her eyes wide with surprise, as she stands frozen in place.       Orion: F-Fuck, Luna?? Are you alright?!                                                             Annie: Luny? Are you okay? What happened?                                                           Luna: . . .                                                                                         Annie: I didn't hit you that hard, did I?                                                           Orion: . . .                                                                                        Luna's gaze shifts between the two of you, then down to herself, and her cheeks burn with a deep    flush.                                                                                              Orion: Luna...? Are you okay? What did you see?                                                     Annie: “See”?                                                                                       Luna: Y-Yeah, I'm okay, don't worry.                                                                Annie: What happened? I'm so confused.                                                              Luna: It's nothing, really. It's just that sometimes I get these... dizzy spells. But they pass     quickly.                                                                                            Annie: Oh, I'm sorry! Was it bad?                                                                   Luna: It... it wasn't. At all. Just that... I mean... I don't think that's ever gonna... I-I've     gotta go. I still have to pass by my dad's cafe before... Erm... y-yeah... I'm okay.                Orion: What did you see??                                                                           Luna: I saw... Just... an ordinary day.                                                             Annie: “See”? What are you guys talking about?                                                      Luna: Um... nothing, sorry! It's just that sometimes I get these... dizzy spells. Um... I've gotta  go! I still have to pass by my dad's cafe before logging in. I'll catch you in Ekabar, Orion.       Orion: Um... sure!                                                                                  Luna: See you later, guys.                                                                          Luna quickly exits the cafe.                                                                        Orion: (That was odd... Did she have a vision? And if so, what did she see...? I've gotta ask her   later...)                                                                                           Annie: Is she gonna be okay? I'm a bit worried.                                                     Orion: Y-Yeah! No worries, it's happened to her before. Nothing to be concerned about, really.      Annie: Well, in that case, I'm more reassured.                                                      Orion: I guess I should head out as well, I don't wanna keep Luna and Penny waiting. Have fun with  Nova!                                                                                               Annie: I will! Give my best to Penny when you see her too.                                          Orion: *Chuckles* Penny? You literally see each other and have dinner together every day.           Luna: *Standing up* It was nice seeing you, Annie. Tell Nova I said hello.                          Annie: Will do! And send my best to Penny, will ya?                                                 Orion: Penny? We literally have dinner together every day.                                          Annie: But I haven't had a chance to catch up with her since yesterday! Promise me you'll give her  my best!                                                                                            Orion: *Laughs* Alright, alright, I will. Take care, Annie.                                         Annie: See you later! And best of luck!                                                             Orion: Later! *Shutting the door behind you* (Alright... equipment ready! Luna should have invited  me by now. I'll admit, it's almost a pity to play Eternum on a sunny d– Okay, nevermind... I forgot we live in Kredon. Sunny moments are as rare as they are brief.) *Jumping on the bed* (Well, it is  what it is. Better now than tomorrow evening, considering I have to go to the studio with Penny     after school. And to be honest, knowing that it's raining in the real world adds a certain ambiance. Knowing that it's raining in the real world adds a certain ambiance.) Hmm. (Can I even continue    calling it the “real world”? I suppose I can... right? I might not have fully processed William's   revelation yet, but one thing's crystal: we've gotta gather those 10 Gems... and I sure as hell     ain't handing them over to him or the Founder.)                                                     Connected. Welcome back to Eternum. You've received an invitation from... Luna.                     Orion: (Right on time!)                                                                             Would you like to join her session?                                                                 Orion: Yes, ma'am.                                                                                  Please prepare to connect...                                                                        Orion: *Taking a deep breath* (Aaaahh... it feels good to be back! So good. The Ekabar server always has this inexplicable “feel good” aura. Even though... today's visit isn't supposed to be the most pleasant of experiences. Which is precisely why having Calypso's help today would've been awesome,  dammit. But...) Really? In this cave, in the middle of nowhere?                                     Calypso: Indeed. It fulfills all the necessary requisites.                                          Orion: So... you're meant to stay here? Meditating?                                                 Calypso: The Elarisil is a ritual perfected by our people over generations. It aids us in channeling all our magic towards a specific objective. Through this, I believe I shall finally be able to find my way back to Hyril'ar. I have deferred my search for far too long.                               Orion: And you need to be alone?                                                                    Calypso: I must remain in complete isolation, with no company but my own.                           Orion: For how long?                                                                                Calypso: It is uncertain. It may span days, or perhaps weeks.                                       Orion: WEEKS?!                                                                                      Calypso: Once you leave this cave, I shall commence the ritual. Under no circumstances must you     disturb me or disrupt the proceedings. Do you understand?                                           Orion: Damn. Well... if you think you can find your homeland through this, we won't disturb you,    don’t worry. Will you be safe all on your own, though? Ekabar can be treacherous.                   Calypso: Do not fret for me. I have yet to encounter a potential threat to my person in any of the  worlds we have visited. And moreover... I doubt your presence would alter the outcome in combat.    Orion: Hey, you know I'm no ordinary human. Who knows, I might even surprise you. It wouldn't be the first time, would it...?                                                                           Calypso: . . . Hmph. Y-You have demonstrated yourself a capable warrior, I will admit that.         Orion: *Chuckles* (She might be an elven Princess, but in the end, she stutters like any other girl would when she's nervous.)                                                                          Calypso: If all proceeds according to plan, the next time we meet I shall have reclaimed my throne. Remember, do not disturb me under any circumstances.                                                Orion: We won't, my Princess. I wish you the utmost success.                                        Calypso: Thank you, Orion. You shall be granted a special place in my court when I reign over       Hyril'ar once more.                                                                                 Orion: Next to the Princess herself?                                                                Calypso: Directly under her.                                                                        Orion: (That's certainly the position I'd like to be in...) What an honor, your Highness...         Calypso: Regardless... I shall commence now. If all proceeds according to plan, the next time we    meet I shall have reclaimed my throne. Remember, do not disturb me under any circumstances.         Orion: We won't, my Princess. I wish you the utmost success.                                        Calypso: Hmph.                                                                                      Orion: (So... yeah, better not to disturb her.)                                                     Luna: Orion!                                                                                        *You turn around and see Luna at the other side of the river.                                       Orion: Hey there!                                                                                   Luna: Come this way, the village is up north!                                                       Orion: On it! Ah, I'm relieved to see you're alright! I was kind of worried after what went down at the cafe with Annie. I guess that what happened was partly on me, too.                              Luna: Oh... don't worry, you seriously didn't do anything wrong. I just forgot who I was for a      moment and... well, this is why I always wear gloves in the real world.                             Orion: What did you see, though? You're usually so calm, so seeing you that rattled threw me off.   Was it... was it something bad? Is Annie in danger?                                                 Luna: No! Not at all! She's fine, really. We... we seemed to be more than fine, actually.           Orion: We?                                                                                          Luna: It was nothing, really. Like I said, my visions are random and I can't control what I see. I  just saw... an ordinary day in Annie's future. Nothing to worry about.                              Orion: Oh... well, you put me at ease, then.                                                        Luna: Mm-hm.                                                                                        Orion: (She's clearly hiding something... I might ask her again about it at a better time.) You     know, changing the subject, I love your look! Wow, I love your look! Very... “Van Helsing-esque”.   Luna: Thanks! I prepared 3 hunter outfits for the three of us. Ah, thanks. I prepared 3 hunter      outfits for the three of us.                                                                        Orion: *Gasps* I have one too?!                                                                     Luna: Yes! Do you wanna try it? I'll send it to your inventory.                                     Orion: You bet I do!                                                                                Luna gives you your new outfit and turns her back on you.                                           Orion: *Getting changed* So... do we know the exact location of this village?                       Luna: That's what I was trying to determine right now. If I'm not mistaken, Hollowbrook should be   beyond that small hill, about a 20-minute walk from this Exit Portal.                               Orion: Ah, not too far from here, that's good.                                                      Luna: Our meeting point was supposed to be right at the village entrance, so Penny might already be waiting for us there.                                                                               Orion: Let's not keep her waiting, then! I think I'm ready! What do you think? It looks pretty cool, doesn't it?                                                                                        Luna: You look so... badass! I was worried I might have picked the wrong size, but it seems not. It fits you like a glove.                                                                              Orion: *Putting on the mask* Oh boy, I feel like a hunter already. What's our cover? Vampire        slayers?                                                                                            Luna: I'll explain more when we find Penny, but I thought of telling them we're indeed hunters from another village that was also attacked by vampires. And that we're there to assist the villagers,   essentially.                                                                                        Orion: That sounds good!                                                                            Luna: We can use this cover to find out how it all began and what triggered their erratic behavior. They even killed real players not too long ago, so we should be extra careful.                      Orion: Interesting... They could be the key to free all the NPCs from Ulysses' control.             Luna: And remember, no magic – they might mistake us for foes too.                                  Orion: No magic, gotcha.                                                                            Luna: Are you ready?                                                                                Orion: I'm ready! Monster hunters Luna Hernandez and Orion Richards set off on a thrilling new      adventure in Hollowbrook!                                                                           Luna: *Chuckles* Follow me.                                                                         Following a brief stroll through the forest, you and Luna unexpectedly come upon a village nestled  in the heart of the woods.                                                                          Orion: Shit, it's gotta be this!                                                                    Luna: Yes, this has to be Hollowbrook. But it looks...                                              Orion: Abandoned.                                                                                   Luna: I like abandoned villages. When I began to play Eternum there was one I liked to visit a lot. It had an old barn where I liked to hide. I even became friends with a cow.                         Orion: (God, she's adorable.) This one looks especially decrepit, though. Do you think we're too    late? Did the vampires... kill everyone?                                                            Luna: I hope not...                                                                                 Suddenly, Penelope appears at the doorway of the nearest house and starts enthusiastically waving   her hand for you to come closer.                                                                    Luna: Penny! Wait... that's Penny, right?                                                           Orion: Yep! (I could recognize those hips from a mile away...) We're coming!                        You step inside, as Penelope promptly closes the door behind you.                                   Orion: Good to see you, Penny!                                                                      Penelope: Silence!                                                                                  Orion: W-What?                                                                                      Penelope: Shhh, keep your voice down. We don't know who could be watching us.                       Orion: Watching us...?                                                                              Penelope: I arrived a bit earlier than we agreed to scout the surroundings, and this whole village  gives off an eerie vibe that I don't like. I had this strange sense, like I was being watched. We   have to be careful.                                                                                 Orion: Oh, I see...                                                                                 Penelope: I also found some footprints on the road leading to the south forest that appear to be    from a rather big canine. So... be cautious.                                                        Orion: (She arrived “a bit earlier to scout”, eh? And I thought she was hitting the mall. Heh, who  would've thought Penelope would get so into Eternum? She's been playing even more than me lately.   And I've gotta say... I love it. It makes her even sexier.)                                         Penelope: Looking good, Orion. You look badass. I dig it.                                           Orion: Ah, thanks! You look fantastic as well.                                                      Luna: I'm with Orion on this one!                                                                   Penelope: Thanks, guys!                                                                             Orion: By the way... looking good, Penny!                                                           Penelope: Right? I'm really loving this outfit, too. It's a gift from someone with a remarkable,    hidden talent for fashion.                                                                          Luna: *Chuckles* I just went for bolder colors for your outfit. I thought you'd like it.            Penelope: *Leaning next to Luna* I'm in LOVE with it. Luna should become the official stylist of the team. I've passed on all my knowledge, she's the master now.                                       Orion: *Chuckles* I'm all for it. Everyone knows that in video games, and... well, by extension...  parallel astral realities, the only stat that truly matters for an outfit is how good it looks.     Luna: I only had two silver swords, though, so we'll have to share.                                 Penelope: No worries, I'll probably use mine only as a prop. I've never had sword practice, so magic will be my go-to if we run into danger.                                                            Orion: Just remember, no magic unless it's absolutely necessary. We can't afford to blow our cover. That's assuming there's even an NPC left alive in the village, of course...                         Luna: We should aim for the town center. If there's anyone alive, they'll likely be there.          Penelope: Yeah, we should check it out before nightfall. The sun's setting soon.                    Orion: Good idea. Alright then, we've got our plan! Time to hunt down those bloody vampires. Hmmm... Is this the center of the village already?                                                         Penelope: I believe so, yeah.                                                                       Orion: It's a rather small settlement.                                                              Penelope: True, I doubt there were more than 300 people living here.                                Luna: Should we start going through the houses one by one? Maybe we'll find someone this way.       An intense chill runs down your spine.                                                              Orion: (This sensation again... like in the Western server. As if I could... sense the danger.)     Penelope: Orion?                                                                                    Orion: That won't be necessary.                                                                     Luna: What?                                                                                         Orion: Searching each house. Looks like they've found us already.                                   Penelope: Huh?                                                                                      Four men suddenly descend with swift, graceful precision from the roof of a nearby building.        Hunter: *Standing up* You don't belong here, outsiders. The sun is about to set. Leave now if you   value your lives.                                                                                   Orion: *Pointing at your attire* We're hunters, just like you. Our village was ravaged by vampires a long time ago. We've come to ensure you don't suffer the same fate.                                Hunter: Magic is a malevolent force, a temptation from the devil in this world. It is present       everywhere. Seek your battles elsewhere. We'll manage here.                                         Orion: Are you all... hunting the demons?                                                           Hunter: Those who couldn't wield a blade or run fast enough... left us long ago. Few of us remain.  Orion: So you're all from Hollowbrook? Why don't you abandon the town?                              Hunter: We won't rest until those abominations have been eradicated. The Lord watches over us in our pursuit.                                                                                           Orion: When did the attacks begin? How many have–                                                   Hunter: Enough questions. Leave, before night is upon us.                                           Orion: (He's on the defensive. We should help them dispatch the “demons” – they'll probably be more open to our questions after. There has to be something that triggered their abnormal behavior, and  we need to discover what.) I insist. Let us help you in this hunt.                                  Hunter: . . . Alright... suit yourself. But know this: if you fall, your remains will feed the swine come dawn. You won't receive a proper burial.                                                      Orion: I... I understand. (This is certainly not the warm welcome I was expecting.)                 Hunter: About the women... they must seek shelter inside the inn, with the rest of them.            Luna: What? We're also hunters.                                                                     Hunter: Only men can be hunters.                                                                    Luna: Maybe in Hollowbrook, but where we're from, it's a different story.                           Hunter: Oh, yeah? And what do you expect to do when a 250-pound mongrel tries to rip your leg off?  Orion: (Oh shit, so that's where the howls we've been hearing come from...)                         Luna: I'm sure we'll manage, one way or another. And if we don't... well, we'll face the music.     Hunter: . . . Bah. Do as you like. Just don't bring those cursed creatures to the town, or we will  treat you no differently than them.                                                                 Orion: We won't. So, where can we find them?                                                        Hunter: Head east to the old crypt of the Lord of Hollowbrook, that's where those bloodsuckers like to hang out. We've tried to smoke 'em out a few times, but they're slippery vermin. And for the     mutts, well, they're somewhere out west. Couldn't tell you exactly where.                           Orion: Mutts...? Do you mean... werewolves?                                                         Hunter: You can call them whatever you want. In the end, they're all just demons that need to be    butchered like the beasts they are.                                                                 Orion: Of course... I understand the situation. By dawn, there won't be any demons left standing.   Hunter: Hmm.                                                                                        Orion: Anything else we should know?                                                                Hunter: . . . You don't have a weapon. There's a sword in the first house past the chapel. If you're curious about what happens to the dogs who get too close, they're in the same spot. Vampires, on   the other hand, simply turn to ashes when the sun kisses 'em.                                       Orion: I... appreciate it, I'll check it out. Good luck.                                            Hunter: . . .                                                                                       Orion: Well... Vampires and werewolves. This is getting better and better by the moment.            Penelope: I think it's cool!                                                                        Orion: Really?                                                                                      Luna: Absolutely! I've always been captivated by stories about vampires and lycanthropes.           Orion: *Chuckles* Your enthusiasm is infectious, I'll admit it. Okay, so... what's the plan?        Penelope: I suggest we split up. It increases our chances of finding the monsters.                  Orion: Are you sure? Will you be able to handle something like that all alone?                      Penelope: Oh, definitely, trust me! I've been honing my skills and making great progress with my    magic.                                                                                              Orion: Well... alright, but if you're planning to use magic keep out of sight from the villagers!   Luna: How should we split up?                                                                       Penelope: I'll take on the vampires! If they're as elegant as the legends go, I want to witness it  firsthand.                                                                                          Luna: Oh, I'll go find the werewolves, then. I've always felt more comfortable around animals than  people anyway.                                                                                      Orion: Damn, no one can say you're hesitant, that's for sure. Alright, I guess that settles it. I'll stay in town, gather intel, maybe even find some clues. Or maybe the creatures decide to attack the town at night, so it's probably better if one of us stays around.                                  Penelope: That sounds good! Let's meet again here in 4 hours.                                       Orion: Okay, let's do that. But promise me, be careful!                                             Penelope: Don't worry, a couple of low-level monsters are no threat to us!                          Luna: She's right! YOU be careful!                                                                  Orion: I will, I will... *Sighs* Four hours, everyone! Four hours and we all rendezvous here!       Luna: Yes!                                                                                          Penelope: Deal!                                                                                     Orion: (Agh, splitting up again. That’s always worked well before, yeah...) . . . *Sighs* (I guess I have to trust them, though. We're a team, and I can't be everywhere at once. I should do my part.  Let's start checking out the house that man mentioned... Mmh, it should be this one. Holy fuck...   These are... the werewolves? They revert to their human forms after dying, I guess... Jesus, they   mutilated and burned their corpses. Or... at least I hope they were already dead when they burned   them. My god... I better investigate the rest of the village. I feel like the sooner we leave this  place, the better...) *Yawns* AAAaagh... (It hasn't even been two hours, and I've already scoured   the entire village. It's like a ghost town, except for a couple of houses. And what's worse, trying to talk to the few villagers left is like talking to a brick wall.) *Sighs* (I should have stuck    with the girls.) .​​ㅤ​​ㅤ.​​ㅤ​​ㅤ.​​ㅤ​​ㅤ.​​ㅤ​​ㅤ.                                                      .​​ㅤ​​ㅤ.​​ㅤ​​ㅤ.​​ㅤ​​ㅤ.​​ㅤ​​ㅤ.​​ㅤ​​ㅤ.​​ㅤ​​ㅤ.​​ㅤ​​ㅤ.​​ㅤ​​ㅤ. (...I don't like being alone with my      thoughts for so long. I'm much happier when I don't overthink what I do and just go with the flow.) . . . (Maybe I should try to find them? I'd probably be way more useful out there than here. But... what if the monsters attack the town while I'm away?) . . . (You know what, let's leave it to       chance. I think I have a coin around here somewhere. Hmm... Aha! Alright, let fate decide whether I should go find them or not.)                                                                        Heads                                                                                               Orion: Heads, I go help them. Tails, I stay in town.                                                Tails                                                                                               Orion: Tails, I go help them. Heads, I stay in town. Hmm? Heads! Tails! (Well, it's decided. I'll go find them. I won't be the one to go against fate.) Now, the big question... Should I head east or  west? Vampires or werewolves? Hmmm... (Let's go find Penny. She's probably the one who needs more   help anyway, she's still a newbie after all. I'm sure Luna will be fine. Let's go find Luna.        Werewolves seem way more menacing. I’m sure Penny will be able to charm the vampires. The werewolves though... some extra help won't hurt, I'm sure.) *Standing up* (Alright then, let's wrap up this   whole thing before it gets too late. It's easy to forget that it's still Thursday and there's school tomorrow... So let's get moving!)                                                                  After a meandering walk through the woods, you eventually stumble upon an ancient cemetery, cocooned in the embrace of shadows.                                                                         Orion: (Ah! This has to be the place. The hunter mentioned an old crypt. Hmm, I wonder if Penny was able to find it, too. Maybe she's already back in the village waiting for us. I should get closer to be sure... O-Okay, this place is kinda creepy, not gonna lie. Maybe... Huh? A torch on the         floor...? Shit, could it be Penny's? Ugh, just the thought makes me shiver. I don't like this... But there's no turning back now.) *Taking a deep breath* (Grow a pair, Orion. YOU'RE A HUNTER.)        You pick up the torch from the ground and slowly open the creaky cemetery door. You can hear it     shutting behind you.                                                                                Orion: *Whispering* Penny? Are you here? I've come to lend a hand!                                  . . . You start walking through the corridors of the old cemetery, only to find dead trees and      weathered tombstones.                                                                               Orion: (Holy fuck, this scenario looks like something straight out of a spooky movie.) Hello...?    . . .                                                                                               Orion: (Dammit Penny, where are you... Hmm... This place looks completely deserted. I wonder if     there are even any vampires. Maybe there are no werewolves either... maybe it's all part of a       collective hysteria, stories spun from too much mead and–)                                          You hear a noise coming from behind the mausoleum in front of you.                                  Orion: H-Hey! I heard that! Show yourself or you'll regret it...                                    Penelope suddenly appears and shoves you against the cold, stone wall.                              Orion: P-Penny? Oh, thank god, I thought–                                                           Penelope: Quiet, demon!                                                                             Orion: I'm sorry...? It's me, Orion!                                                                Penelope: The real Orion is in Hollowbrook!                                                         Orion: What?! I mean... yes, I was, but then I got bored and came over to help you!                 Penelope: Oh, great, a repeat of the Warthogs incident...                                           Orion: Eh?                                                                                          Penelope: You're not the first fake Orion I’ve run into!                                            Orion: WHAT?! I'm real!                                                                             Penelope: How do I know you're not just some Boggle trying to deceive me? Prove it!                 Orion: Um... o-okay. Eh... Remember when we...                                                      Had the photo session                                                                               Orion: Had the photo session?! I hadn't been in Kredon for too long, and we both went to a          photoshoot together. I told Valentino to leave, and we ended up having a... private session. A...   really good one.                                                                                    Used the Reminiscecombobulator                                                                      Orion: Used the Reminiscecombobulator?! It was your first time in Eternum, so we went with Luna to  Warthogs to learn the basics of magic. We both saw one of your memories where you gave up going to  the dance so Nancy could get her new job!                                                           Went to Regina's room                                                                               Orion: Went to Regina's room?! She ruined your Idriel costume, and then we went to her room to      retrieve the yearbook. We didn't find it, but we ended up... naked, and... doing some other things. Good... things. And we... er... I left a mess on the floor. Erm... Orchestrated a heist together? We stole Garrington's Gem from his own casino! You disguised yourself as a renowned influencer and    convinced his son he'd been poisoned!                                                               Penelope: Oh... *Putting her sword down* I do remember that.                                        Orion: Oh, thank goodness...                                                                        Penelope: How come you brought that up?                                                             Orion: I don't know, it just popped into my head. That day holds a special place in my memories.    Penelope: That's not what I was expecting you to say... but I like it. Although... I would've been  equally pleased with a nod to those incredibly delicious pretzels we baked with Annie the other     day.                                                                                                Orion: *Laughs* That was my backup choice.                                                          Penelope: Only recalling horny stuff when trying to remember a past memory? Yeah, you're definitely the real Orion.                                                                                     Orion: *Laughs* Hey, it's your fault that those memories struck a chord with me...                  Penelope: *Chuckles* Fair enough. At least now I know you're legit. Although... I would've also     accepted a nod to those incredibly delicious pretzels we baked with Annie the other day.            Orion: *Laughs* That was my backup choice. I'm relieved to see you're okay, Penny.                  Penelope: And I'm so glad you're here!                                                              Orion: Are you alright? What happened to your vest?                                                 Penelope: Ugh, don't remind me... I got ambushed by those cursed vampires and they tore it off.     Orion: Oh shit, really?                                                                             Penelope: Yeah, I managed to shake them off, but I lost my vest in the process. Luna is gonna be    mad...                                                                                              Orion: *Chuckles* Don't worry, I don't think I've ever seen Luna angry. It's a shame, though. It was such a nice outfit.                                                                                Penelope: I know!                                                                                   Orion: Try to look on the bright side, at least now you have more freedom of movement.              Penelope: *Pressing her boobs together* Well... Yes... but actually, no. You catch my drift?        Orion: N-Not really, no. What do you mean?                                                          Penelope: Like, the vest was also kind of supporting my breasts, you know? I mean... I'm not wearing anything under this shirt.                                                                         Orion: Oh. (My god... Is she trying to hypnotize me? Because she's certainly succeeding.)           Penelope: Standing still or walking is fine, but when I had to sprint to escape from those vampires earlier... it kinda hurt. Because of the... you know, the bouncing.                                 Orion: Oh, of course, yeah... I can imagine. (Oh boy, would you look at that... I can't believe I   actually got to shove my cock between Penny's massive tits at the party. I'd give anything to repeat that someday. Which reminds me... we're supposed to have a photo session together tomorrow. And she seemed quite excited when she asked me to go with her. Maybe... she’s hinting she wants to do      something more with me...? I mean, I don't think so. We haven't really talked about it since that   day. And... it's a public place, after all. Although... the first photoshoot was also in a public   place, and...)                                                                                      You raise your gaze from Penelope's chest to meet her eyes, finding her staring at you in a bemused manner.                                                                                             Orion: *Clears throat* SO! W-We'll have to retrieve that vest! Did you say... vampires took it?     Penelope: Yeah... I guess.                                                                          Orion: And... the vampires took it, you say?                                                        Penelope: Yeah... those fucking leeches. They're fast as hell, and there's literally a horde of     them, but luckily they're also stupid. If we set up a trap, we should be able to outmaneuver them.  *Whispering* Come over here, I'll show it to you.                                                   Orion: Are they still in this cemetery? I didn't see anything earlier.                              Penelope: That's because they all rushed to the other side when I screamed before. They're blind,   but they hunt by sound. They're coming this way... look!                                            You look towards the direction Penelope is pointing at and squint your eyes into the inky darkness. Orion: Hmm...                                                                                       A creature suddenly climbs up the tombstone with lightning-fast speed.                              Orion: H-Holy shit! What the fuck is that?!                                                         Penelope: *Whispering* Keep your voice down!                                                        Vampire: *Squeals*                                                                                  Answering the call, more creatures start emerging from everywhere, heading towards your direction.  Penelope: O-Oh shit.                                                                                Orion: Fuck, there are dozens of them!                                                              Penelope: I tried to attack one of them before, but they seem to be immune to magic.                Orion: That's not good...                                                                           Penelope: Maybe you can take my sword and–                                                          You swiftly push Penelope around the corner.                                                        Penelope: W-What's going on?                                                                        Orion: *Whispering* Don't make a sound. One of them is coming this way. *Whispering* And he looks   BIG.                                                                                                Penelope: *Whispering* W-What?                                                                      Orion: (A-Alright Orion, calm down. If magic can't harm them, now's the time to put into practice   Dalia's training from last week. O-Okay, what was the first step against bigger enemies... Think,   Orion, think... It was... Goddammit, Dalia needs to stop wearing those shorts to our training       sessions. I get distracted way too easily. H-HOLY SHIT. I was right, up close they're way larger    than they looked from a distance. Now that I see one standing straight, they almost look...         human-like.)                                                                                        The creature remains still, utterly immobile. You can feel Penelope clinging tightly to your back,  her body pressed firmly against yours.                                                              Orion: (Why is he not moving? Why did he stop here...? Wait... They might be blind, but... What     about their sense of smell...?)                                                                     Vampire: *Sniffs* . . .                                                                             Orion: *Activating your powers* You wanna dance, you bastard? *Pushing Penelope behind you* THEN    LET'S DANCE!                                                                                        Vampire: *Squeals* Gggh. *Collapsing to the ground* G-Gggghh-h-hgghhhh...                           ???: You stupid animal... Can't you see that they're our guests?                                    Penelope: What the...                                                                               ???: Of course you can't. *Kicking the creature* Now get out of my sight! And go take a shower, for heaven's sake, you reek like rotten eggs! *Bowing gracefully* Good evening, madam and sir.          Mortimer: I am Mortimer. Please, accept my sincerest apologies for the unsettling welcome you just  received.                                                                                           Orion: Uh...                                                                                        Penelope: N-No problem.                                                                             Mortimer: It is my great pleasure to welcome you to Lord Iliescu's residence.                       Orion: What... How... WHAT are you?!                                                                Mortimer: I understand that my actual appearance can be... startling at first. However, please be   assured, my manners are nothing like those of my less refined brethren.                             Orion: So... you're also a vampire, then? Why can you speak, when the others can’t?                 Mortimer: I am certain Lord Iliescu will be more than willing to address all of your inquiries.     Please, allow me to escort you to his chambers.                                                     Orion: Um... I appreciate the offer, but we're actually in a bit of a hurry. We were headed to      West...sylvania and arrived in Hollowbrook by mistake. We should probably get a move on.            Mortimer: Please, I insist. I am confident Lord Iliescu and his wife would be delighted to receive  you. It has been quite some time since we last had visitors... excluding those vexatious hunters, of course. Because... you're not hunters, are you?                                                    Orion: N-Not at all.                                                                                Mortimer: Good, good. I noticed you're wearing hunter attire, but the lady's outfit doesn't seem to adhere to the typical female regulation. And when I saw you entering the cemetery without           immediately attempting to set everything ablaze, I thought it was just a mere coincidence. Perhaps  you took the guise of the hunter to travel across this land more easily?                            Orion: That's... surprisingly accurate, actually.                                                   Mortimer: Now please, come with me to meet Lord Iliescu. I assure you, it shan't take more than 15  minutes of your time.                                                                               Orion: Um... (Hmm... it seems like he's actually a genuinely nice guy... despite his appearance. At worst, I could activate my powers and take Penelope to a safe place before they even realized what  was happening.) Alright... we'll meet them. But we have to be back in Hollowbrook within 30 minutes. Northsylvania awaits!                                                                              Mortimer: I thought you said Westsylvania.                                                          Orion: W-Westsylvania awaits!                                                                       Mortimer: *Bowing gracefully* Excellent! Please, follow me.                                         Orion: Sure. *Whispering* The things that happen to us... Never a dull day.                         Penelope: *Chuckles* I like it! It's exciting!                                                      Orion: Let's see what this “Lord” can tell us...                                                    Mortimer guides you through a labyrinth of tunnels and galleries, eventually leading you to a crypt adorned with a mysterious altar at its center.                                                      Mortimer: Here it is!                                                                               Orion: *Whispering* Do you remember the way out?                                                    Penelope: *Whispering* We took a right, then left, another left, down the stairs, followed by a     right, straight ahead, left, and finally, another right.                                            Orion: *Whispering* God bless your memory.                                                          Mortimer: *Bowing gracefully* Please, wait here. Lord Iliescu will meet you shortly.                Orion: Of course... thank you, Mortimer.                                                            Mortimer: I live to serve.                                                                          Penelope: *Walking into the room* Wow, it's so humid in here.                                       Orion: *Shivers* And bone-chillingly cold. I've gotta say, if I were to imagine the dwelling of a   vampire... it would look exactly like this.                                                         Penelope: *Sitting on the altar* Really?                                                            Orion: Wouldn't you?                                                                                Penelope: I don't know, I kind of pictured it more like a grand castle. Elegant attires, baroque    decor, an air of opulence draping every corner... like in Interview with a Vampire, you know?       Orion: Mmmm, yeah, Mortimer isn't exactly Brad Pitt.                                                Penelope: *Laughs* Yeah, he's not. Although he does have his charm.                                 Orion: *Laughs* He does.                                                                            Penelope: I wonder if– AAAAARGGHHHH!! WHAT THE FUCK?!                                               Orion: *Getting into attack position* Watch out!                                                    Penelope: *Standing up with a jump* You son of a bitch! Who are you?! Was this a trap? Speak before we kill you!                                                                                        Lord Iliescu: *Shaking off the dust from his clothes* I-I'm sorry, I apologize. It's just that...   it's been so long since we last had visitors that I kind of forgot how to make a proper             introduction. *Clears throat* Pleased to meet you, travelers. I am Lazarus Iliescu, sovereign of    Stravenovia... at your service.                                                                     Penelope: *Catching her breath* You're... Lord Iliescu?                                             Lord Iliescu: Since the day I was born.                                                             Orion: You sure made quite an entrance... Um... we're Orion and Penelope. Nice to meet you.         Lord Iliescu: It feels refreshing to engage in conversation with someone other than Mortimer and my wife Lysa... Oh... I almost forgot. Lysandra? Where are you, my dear? We have guests.               Orion: It's not necessary, really, we just–                                                         Lady Iliescu: *Sniffing* Aaaaahhh... yeeeesss... I could smell them outside the crypt...            Orion: (Where the hell did she come from...?)                                                       Lady Iliescu: *Sniffing* They smell... wonderfully indeed...                                        Orion: (D-Damn, she's fast as fuck.)                                                                Lady Iliescu: Look at this human, Lazarus. So... strong... *Sniffing* So... virile.                 Orion: Um... thank you, ma'am.                                                                      Lady Iliescu: Y-You would make an exceptional vampire, young man. Have you ever considered it?      Orion: Erm...                                                                                       Lady Iliescu: Once we manage to break this c-curse, it'll only have benefits! YES! Immortality,     eternal youth, superhuman might, and access to carnal pleasures beyond mortal imagining.            Orion: Well, when you put it that way, it does sound... intriguing, for sure.                       Lady Iliescu: Mm-hmm... Have you ever had your blood suctioned from your erect member?              Orion: I... haven't had the pleasure, no.                                                           Lady Iliescu: This is your chance, boy.                                                             Orion: Uh...                                                                                        Penelope: Orion...?                                                                                 Lady Iliescu: And... oh, my DEAR, look at this woman! *Sniffing* As s-splendorous as him!           Penelope: Um...                                                                                     Lady Iliescu: We must convert them... What a mammate specimen! Just smell this bosom! These         precious, rounded vessels full of blood... Have you ever seen breasts of this size, Lazarus?        *Sniffing* Aaahhhh... the muliebrity...                                                             Penelope: C-Could you please... stop sniffing my chest, ma'am?                                      Lady Iliescu: *Returning to Lord Iliescu's side* O-Of course, of course! W-Where are my manners!    *Sinister giggle* W-W-Welcome to our castle, Orionov and... Popolina.                               Lord Iliescu: I'm afraid you'll have to excuse my wife's behavior, she's been feeling rather...     peculiar as of late.                                                                                Orion: Y-Yeah, we noticed.                                                                          Lord Iliescu: This is not her usual self, I assure you. It's all because of this damn curse.        Penelope: A curse? So... you weren't always vampires?                                               Lord Iliescu: Oh, no, not that. We come from a proud lineage of Strigoi. Our entire people, in fact.Lady Iliescu: Everything was harmonious when we lived in idyllic Stravenovia. There were only       feasts, and parties... Ah, the parties...                                                           Lord Iliescu: Until one day... Something changed. One by one, our entire kin began to transform into these... creatures you saw outside. Now, only we remain.                                           Penelope: *Gasps* Those monsters outside are... your people?                                        Lord Iliescu: What's left of them. They begin by exhibiting erratic behavior. Their thirst increases dramatically. Finally, they become the mindless creatures you encountered. Only Mortimer managed to maintain his sanity after the process was complete. The others would be little more than animals if not for my ability to control them.                                                                Penelope: You can control them all at will?                                                         Lord Iliescu: I can. I gave them orders to guard the cemetery from outsiders while we remain here.  Orion: So, your wife...                                                                             Lord Iliescu: Yes. The initial stages of the transformation have already begun. That's why we       traveled so far from our homeland. I will find a way to break this curse before it's too late. I    WILL NOT LET MY WIFE BECOME ONE OF THOSE VOMITIVE AND HORRENDOUS MONSTROSITIES! No offense,         Mortimer.                                                                                           Mortimer: None taken, sir. I'm as ugly as the devil permits.                                        Lord Iliescu: So... yeah, this is our story. What about you, though? What brought you to our abode? Orion: Um... (It's probably best we avoid mentioning we actually came to hunt them down... Still    might be a good chance to get some info about what made all NPCs go rogue in this area, though.)    We... we're simply passing through, to be honest. We're investigating something that affected the   people in this area. Some kind of... magic. Probably.                                               Lord Iliescu: In that case, I can certainly be of assistance.                                       Orion: Huh...? Can you?                                                                             Lord Iliescu: My lineage has been amassing knowledge from both the earthly and astral realms for    millennia. Whatever questions you have, I'm confident we can assist. Though, I will ask for your    assistance in return.                                                                               Orion: (The astral realm, he said...? Hmm, maybe he knows more about the nature of Eternum than I   initially thought.) Very well. In that case...                                                      Lord Iliescu: Hold on a moment. I will gladly answer all your inquiries, but first, I must          explicitize my request.                                                                             Orion: Ah, I should have seen this coming...                                                        Lord Iliescu: It's simple enough. I'd like you to help me heal my wife.                             Orion: And how am I supposed to do that?                                                            Lord Iliescu: All we ask for... is a waltz dance.                                                   Penelope: A... waltz dance?                                                                         Lord Iliescu: You see, before all of our people turned into monsters, we used to host big masquerade parties at our grand castle. The ballroom dances were my wife's most cherished pastime, and she    sorely misses them.                                                                                 Lady Iliescu: *Imitating the sound of a violin* Tarara... nanana... nino...                         Lord Iliescu: Maybe... remembering the life we once knew... will stop, or at least slow down my     wife's transformation. So, if you would grant us one last dance for us to witness and reminisce... I will assist you in every way I can. That's all we ask for.                                         Accept                                                                                              Orion: So... we just have to dance?                                                                 Refuse                                                                                              Orion: (Yeah, no chance I'm dancing in front of these people. We have better things to do.) Um...   well, I'd gladly accept, but Penelope twisted her ankle earlier.                                    Penelope: Did I...?                                                                                 Orion: Yes. Severely. So... yeah, it won't be possible, I'm afraid. So... we just have to dance? I'm not entirely confident in my waltzing abilities.                                                   Lord Iliescu: Don't worry about that, just let the music guide you and your wife.                   Alright                                                                                             Orion: Hmm... well, alright then, seems fair. Let's do it.                                          Penelope: W-What...? Are we really doing this? Are you serious?                                     She's not my wife                                                                                   Orion: Uhh... well, she's not my wife, but... alright, let's do it.                                 Penelope: W-What...? Are we really doing this? Are you serious?                                     She's not my wife, yet                                                                              Orion: Well, she's not my wife yet, but... alright, let's do it.                                    Penelope: W-What...? What did you just say...?                                                      Orion: It can't be that hard, can it? It's worth a try!                                             Penelope: N-No, not the dance, I mean the...                                                        Orion: Hmm?                                                                                         Penelope: Um... N-Nevermind. Um... so... are we really doing this?                                  Orion: Yeah, why not? It'll be fun!                                                                 Penelope: Do you even have any clue about what you're supposed to do?                               Orion: *Chuckles* Of course! Trust me. And hey, this is my long-awaited opportunity to repay you    with the dance I owe you.                                                                           Penelope: Huh. Well... if you insist.                                                               Lord Iliescu: Delightful! Let's begin, then. Now, where are the musicians... Gentlemen, could you   play some waltz music? Perhaps something from...                                                    Orion: What the...                                                                                  Lord Iliescu: Strauss? Tchaikovsky? Any suggestions?                                                Mortimer: Shostakovich?                                                                             Lord Iliescu: Ah, excellent choice, Mortimer. A true classic. Yes, let's play the Waltz No. 2. One, two... One, two, three, and...                                                                      The vampiric musicians begin to play with surprising skill.                                         Orion: *Chuckles* (This whole situation is surreal.) *Extending your hand* My lady.                 Penelope reaches for your hand, a hint of uncertainty and bashfulness still lingering in her eyes.  Orion: The key is to just let yourself go.                                                          Penelope: Mm-hm.                                                                                    Orion: Like this.                                                                                   Penelope: Oh my.                                                                                    You deftly lift Penelope to an upright position, bringing her body as near to you as possible until you can feel her heartbeat through her bust.                                                        Penelope: Where... where did you learn these moves?                                                 Orion: Honestly, I'm not sure.                                                                      Penelope: You're not sure?                                                                          Orion: It's... Eternum.                                                                             Penelope: Eternum? What do you mean?                                                                Orion: Sometimes I feel like I can ace pretty much everything I try to do here. Or learn it         incredibly fast. *Dancing with her* It's like... like I was connected to it, you know? As if I had  learned how to waltz in another life, for instance.                                                 Penelope: Well, you won't see me complaining. Looks like in that past life you were quite the       dancer.                                                                                             Orion: Or... maybe it's just the enchanting company that's fueling my inspiration. Who's to say?    Penelope: Mm-hm... *Giggles* Or maybe you’ve just been practicing in secret for the dance you owed  me?                                                                                                 You and Penelope continue dancing synchronously, the music guiding your steps like a conductor      leading an orchestra through a symphony. For a moment, everything else fades away. No Gems of Doom, no looming threats, no spirits trapped in Eternum – just you... and her. The breaths, the sighs, and the desire between the two of you fill the little space between your shared sensuous movements.    Orion: You know... There's something I've been meaning to ask, Penny.                               Penelope: Hmm?                                                                                      Orion: Are we...                                                                                    Penelope: Hmmmm...?                                                                                 Orion: Do you want to maybe...                                                                      Lady Iliescu: BRAVO! That was absolutely enchanting! Exquisite!                                     Orion: (Damn, I almost forgot we had an audience.)                                                  Lady Iliescu: It was quite an unconventional dance... but beautiful nonetheless!                    Penelope: *Clears throat* T-Thank you.                                                              Orion: (I wonder if Penny felt the same way...)                                                     Lady Iliescu: You really took me back home with this! For a moment, your terpsichorean movements    transported me back to Romania! Bravo!                                                              Orion: (Romania...?)                                                                                Penelope: G-Glad you liked it. I suppose.                                                           Lord Iliescu: I must echo my wife's sentiment, Orion. You both danced with remarkable finesse.      Orion: Thank you, sir.                                                                              Lord Iliescu: You may go now, carrying my eternal gratitude. But before you leave... you mentioned  you had questions before, so feel free to ask.                                                      Penelope: Uh... yeah, I'm certainly not his wife. And... I kind of twisted my ankle, so no dances   for me, I'm afraid.                                                                                 Lord Iliescu: Oh... that is... unfortunate. Very unfortunate.                                       Lady Iliescu: C-Can I get a piece of clothing from you, then?                                       Penelope: Clothing?                                                                                 Lady Iliescu: Yes! The scent takes me back home! It reminds me of the maids I used to have back in  Romania!                                                                                            Orion: (Romania...?)                                                                                Lady Iliescu: Now that they have all transformed into monsters, I can no longer smell those aromas! Penelope: I mean... yeah, sure, I don't see why not.                                                Lady Iliescu: Sweeeet! Tell them whatever they want to know, Lazarus.                               Lord Iliescu: Well... that will do for now, I suppose. But you and your... companion still owe us a dance. Can I trust you'll return once her ankle has healed?                                         Orion: You have my word. (It's not lying if we don't know for sure.)                                Lord Iliescu: Hmm. Very well, then. You can ask your questions before you leave. I'll respond as    honestly as I'm able.                                                                               Orion: I appreciate it. (Mmm, I should get straight to the point. Luna must be already waiting for  us.) Okay... Well, I'd love to stay and continue asking you questions, but we really must be on our way now.                                                                                            What does being a vampire entail?                                                                   Orion: I've often wondered, what exactly does being a vampire entail? Like, can you turn into a bat? Do you die if sunlight touches you?                                                                Lord Iliescu: *Chuckles* Ah, the old tales. It's true that we don't age and we need blood to        survive, but I'm afraid most of what you've heard are just stories meant to frighten children. We   can't transform into bats, and while it's true that sunlight ends up turning us into ashes, it      doesn't instantly kill us. I don't sleep in a coffin, but in a large bed with my wife. And yes, we  can see our reflections in mirrors. As for peculiar items like human crucifixes, they can't harm or scare us more than a common blade. In fact, I use one as a bookend. *Chuckles* And my personal      favorite: for some reason, there's this belief that garlic can repel or harm us. Aaah... *Munching  on the garlic* Mmmm... *Swallows* ... As you can see, that's completely absurd.                     Orion: Did you... Did you just eat a whole head of garlic unpeeled?                                 Lord Iliescu: Yes, it was disgusting. But I wanted to make a point.                                 Orion: Fair enough.                                                                                 What do you remember about your past?                                                               Orion: What do you remember about your past? Before arriving here.                                  Lord Iliescu: Well, as I mentioned, we spent all our lives in Stravenovia, in the Eastern parts of  the continent.                                                                                      Orion: And what about... Romania? Your wife mentioned it earlier.                                   Lord Iliescu: Romania...? I've never heard that name in my life, no.                                Orion: Do you know what “Eternum” is? Or Ulysses? Or things like... Europe, Asia, or America?       Lord Iliescu: Uhh... no, I'm not familiar with those terms, I'm sorry. Despite living for millennia, we've never left Ekabar. Not even we know what lies beyond the great seas.                         Orion: No worries... (His wife definitely mentioned Romania. I heard it. Could their actual memories be intertwined with the false ones they acquired when they became NPCs? Perhaps that's the trigger that can “free” them from Ulysses' control? I’ll need to note that down for later...)               What's your current relationship with the town of Hollowbrook?                                      Orion: What's your current relationship with the town of Hollowbrook?                               Lord Iliescu: It's... not the best. Their hunters started targeting us without any provocation. We  sustain ourselves on the blood of animals, and we never enter settlements unless it's strictly      necessary. However, after they began massacring us... I had to take action. These creatures might be mindless monsters now, but they were once my people. I will not stand idly by while they are       slaughtered.                                                                                        Orion: Understandable. (I wonder what started this surge of erratic behavior among the NPCs. Did the hunters go rogue first? Or perhaps it was the vampires? Hmm...)                                    Leave                                                                                               Orion: Well, I'd love to stay and continue asking you questions, but we really must be on our way   now. I hope we can continue our conversation sometime.                                              Lord Iliescu: Very well. It was a pleasure meeting you, Lord Orion. I also hope we have the chance  to meet again in the future.                                                                        Lady Iliescu: Thank you for the visit! And don't hesitate to return! We don't b-bite, I swear!      Orion: Oh, and by the way...                                                                        Side with the hunters                                                                               Orion: If you truly wish to aid your wife, Hollowbrook is your best bet. We crossed paths with the  hunters upon our arrival, and they were leaving the town for good. Now only a handful of civilians  remain, and among them there's a healer. Perhaps she can provide some assistance. (Hopefully this   will lead to a truce and to us becoming friends with the hunters of Hollowbrook.)                   Lord Iliescu: Oh, that's excellent news. We'll pay them a visit soon, then.                         Side with the vampires                                                                              Orion: We passed through Hollowbrook on our way here, and I can tell you the hunters have lost all  reason. They believe you're all malevolent creatures that must be eradicated. If you wish to help   your wife, you'd be better off far from that town of lunatics.                                      Lord Iliescu: Thanks for the advice, we'll stay away from it. Unfounded fear is something we're     accustomed to. Thanks again for your help, Orion.                                                   Orion: No problem.                                                                                  Lord Iliescu: Mortimer will escort you to the exit.                                                 Mortimer: With pleasure! Stick close, you two lovebirds, unless you fancy becoming dinner for giant tarantulas! Stick close, unless you fancy becoming dinner for giant tarantulas!                     Orion: W-We're right behind you!                                                                    After walking through the woods for a while, you finally come across the ruins of an old fortress.  Orion: *Whistles* (Damn, look at this castle. I mean, it's clear it's seen better days, but its     former glory still shines through. I wonder if Luna also found this place. Without the Lumina spell she taught me, I would have been completely lost in these woods.) *Scanning the surroundings*       (Hmm... There's something off about this place, though. There are lit torches everywhere, so this   can't be the monsters' hideout – there have to be humans nearby. Also, there seem to be... chests   scattered around? It almost looks like they were begging me to plunder their content. Looks like a  classic, basic trap, if you ask me. Probably bandits waiting to catch unsuspecting travelers on the road. A single path through the valley, all surrounded by towering structures. Yep, perfect for an  ambush. Furthermore, the main wall and its gate are still in pretty good condition, which would make a hypothetical attack easy to defend. The whole place is simply too quiet not to be a trap... Damn it, could Luna have fallen victim to this place? What if the bandits have taken her captive?!       Fuck... there are dozens of doors in the main courtyard. Could they have stashed her inside? Or...  perhaps she was captured and taken elsewhere...? FUCK! This place is too big, I'll never find her!  Goddamn it, what should I do... Okay... let's calm down and think this through. Luna might seem     adorable, but she's actually quite powerful. She wouldn't have let herself be captured without a    fight. I'll go down there and try to spot any signs of–)                                            Luna: Orion?                                                                                        Orion: NN-NAAAA-NAA! S-SU-GGL! NN-NAAAA-NAA! S-SU-GGL! G-G-GHJ-HW-WHAT?! Wha... L-Luna? Oh Jesus,   you're okay! Thank goodness! How did you manage to escape from the bandits?!                        Luna: Bandits...? What bandits?                                                                     Orion: Um... *Clears throat* Y-Yeah, for some reason I assumed you'd been captured by a group of    thugs. I'm not sure why. But in any case, I'm relieved to see you're alright!                       Luna: Thanks! I'm glad to see you too!                                                              Orion: How did you find me so fast?                                                                 Luna: Well, you're... quite noisy. And the Lumina spell you casted can actually be spotted from a   mile away.                                                                                          Orion: Oh. Y-Yeah, that's fair. I definitely can't say the same about you, you’re quieter than a    black cat on a moonlit rooftop.                                                                     Luna: But why are you here? I thought you were supposed to stay in Hollowbrook.                     I was bored                                                                                         Orion: I know, but I got bored and thought I would come your way to see those werewolves.           I missed you                                                                                        Orion: I know, but I was missing you, so I decided to come your way. I don't know, playing Eternum  without you isn't the same.                                                                         Luna: Oh... thank you. I... miss you too when you're not around.                                    Orion: *Chuckles* The feeling is definitely mutual.                                                 Luna: Sorry if I've been more distant lately. Between my dad's cafe and the upcoming exams, I've    barely had any free time.                                                                           Orion: No worries! Both Annie and Dalia have been hitting the books like crazy too, whenever they   weren't in Eternum.                                                                                 Luna: I should have more chill time once these exams are over. We can hang out more then. If you    want.                                                                                               Orion: I'd love to!                                                                                 Luna: Cool. I'll text you.                                                                          Orion: Looking forward to it!                                                                       Luna: But anyway, let's focus on the werewolves for now.                                            Orion: Oh, for sure. Can't wait to face off against a real werewolf!                                I thought you'd need the help                                                                       Orion: I know, but then I thought you'd be in danger on your own, so I came your way to lend a hand.Luna: Oh... thank you. Although I should be alright. I've faced tougher things in Eternum.          Orion: Have you ever run into a werewolf in Ekabar before?                                          Luna: I haven't, but I've heard some tales.                                                         Orion: They've always struck me as intriguing. But, I imagine they must be quite terrifying. I got  bored in Hollowbrook, so I decided to come your way to see those werewolves. Well... if they're even real. I mean, I haven't really seen anything strange on my way here, have you? Maybe there are no  vampires either... maybe it's all part of a collective hysteria, stories spun from too much mead and wild imaginations.                                                                                 Luna: *Moving in closer* Well, there is something, of that I'm sure. Even if it's not werewolves,   there's definitely some big stuff roaming around here. Do you see that courtyard?                   Orion: Yeah, I was looking at it before.                                                            Luna: I sent the owl I summoned to do a quick flyby, and it reported back some seriously hefty      footprints over there.                                                                              Orion: Hmm... well, we can't really leave without investigating the area, so... there's only one way to go, if you ask me. Let's make our way to the courtyard and then back to Hollowbrook? Reaching   this place took me longer than expected. Penny might be on her way back too.                        Luna: Sounds good. Just be careful when descending this wall, the rocks are quite slippery.         Orion: Gotcha.                                                                                      You and Luna carefully climb down the steep slope that leads to the fortress entrance.              Luna: This place is so quiet.                                                                       Orion: Yeah, and that freaks me out so much... Keep an eye out.                                     You make your way to the courtyard you spotted earlier, yet you encounter nothing but dust, and     silence.                                                                                            Luna: Nothing. Perhaps the werewolves are gone for good?                                            Orion: Or maybe they were captured by a group of poachers. And then abandoned.                      Luna: Could be.                                                                                     You hear a noise coming from behind you.                                                            Orion: H-Hey!                                                                                       Luna: What happened?                                                                                Orion: I... I heard something.                                                                      Luna: Maybe the wind?                                                                               Orion: No... We're not alone here...                                                                Luna: *Pointing at the door* Let's check inside.                                                    Orion: Inside? Are you sure?                                                                        Luna: Yes. If there are really monsters here... there's something I need to see.                    Orion: *Gulps* Alright then... but stay close. We don't know what kinds of traps we might find.     Werewolf: . . . *Howls*                                                                             Orion: D-Did you hear that? It sounded way closer this time.                                        Luna: Definitely...                                                                                 Orion: Let's get out of here, it's not worth staying here just to win favor with the hunters. Follow m–                                                                                                 As you turn around, a colossal creature almost the size of a car plummets from the stone arch above.Orion: H-Holy shit, THAT is big...                                                                  Luna: Orion...?                                                                                     Another werewolf, as big as the first one, appears on the other side of the courtyard, blocking the only two possible exits.                                                                            Orion: F-Fuck... W-Well, looks like the rumors were true after all... Um... Can you... understand my words? We mean you no harm. We can leave as quietly as we arrived.                                 The creature looks at you menacingly, growling and arching its back.                                Orion: So you're nothing but mindless animals? Fine. Let's see who's faster, you monsters. (I need  to find a way to defend myself while ensuring Luna's safety. She's my priority, even if it          means...)                                                                                           Luna: Wait!                                                                                         Orion: Huh?                                                                                         Luna: Don't attack them!                                                                            Orion: What? Why not?                                                                               Luna: They won't harm us if we don't provoke them.                                                  Orion: W-What? How are you so sure?                                                                 Luna: Trust me!                                                                                     Orion: *Observing the beast* Um... I've seen enough National Geographic documentaries to know that's not a friendly stance, Luna.                                                                       Luna: Please, don't attack them! And don't speak! You have to trust me!                             Orion: Uh... O-Okay, I trust you. I hope we don't regret this...                                    The werewolf in front of Luna takes a small step, preparing to attack.                              Werewolf: . . . *Roars* . . .                                                                       Luna: . . .                                                                                         Werewolf: *Roars* . . . . . . *Looking at the other werewolf* . . .                                 Werewolf: . . . *Nods*                                                                              Werewolf: . . . *Roars* . . .                                                                       Luna: . . .                                                                                         Werewolf: . . . Hmph. Um... Dude, she's not reacting.                                               Orion: (What in the...)                                                                             Werewolf: Why is she not reacting?                                                                  Werewolf: Are you asking me?                                                                        Werewolf: No, I'm asking the mushroom behind you. Of course I'm asking you, dumbshit. What are we   supposed to do now?                                                                                 Werewolf: Eh... I-I don't know, usually everyone's run away by this point.                          Werewolf: What did the guard orientation handbook say?                                              Werewolf: Um... I'm not sure, I haven't finished reading it yet.                                    Werewolf: Duuude...                                                                                 Werewolf: Don't give me that look, you know how much Fangrend likes to over-explain everything. That thing has like... a hundred pages. He literally weaves in a childhood story that spans three       chapters just to explain night shifts.                                                              Werewolf: *Cheeky laugh* Yeah, the one about the rice fields, right?                                Luna: Hi!                                                                                           Werewolf: *Backing off* WHAT THE HELL?! SHE CAN SPEAK!                                              Werewolf: Of course she can speak, nitwit. She's a human, humans can talk.                          Werewolf: Ah, yeah, that makes sense.                                                               Werewolf: And didn't you hear them chatting just a minute ago?                                      Werewolf: I didn't, no. Still got my ears clogged from our last swim.                               Werewolf: Again? That's why I always tell you to bring earplugs, dude.                              Werewolf: Alright, Mom. I'll grab my jacket next time too.                                          The two creatures step back a few paces, assuming a relaxed stance before you and Luna.             Werewolf: *Clears throat* Erm... well, this is awkward.                                             Duke: Uh... hello. My name's Duke, and my buddy here's Burpee.                                      Luna: I'm Luna! Nice to meet you guys.                                                              Orion: Yeah, and I'm... Orion. I have to admit, when I saw you I wasn't expecting you to be so...   rational.                                                                                           Duke: And we didn't expect you to... do nothing. Like, at all. Everyone usually just runs away. Why didn't you?                                                                                         Luna: I had a hunch when I saw Duke cautiously walking to avoid stepping on that flower over there. Orion: A flower?                                                                                    Luna: That one. He passed right over it, but he carefully stepped aside not to crush it. No         mindless, wild animal would care about a simple flower.                                             Duke: Ohh... she's clever.                                                                          Burpee: Yeah, and you're dumb. Why do you care about a shitty flower?                               Duke: Maaaan, it just sprouted!                                                                     Burpee: But why...? Do they taste good?                                                             Duke: No. It's about its beauty.                                                                    Burpee: Ahh... Yeah, forgot you're a weirdo.                                                        Duke: Shut up.                                                                                      Luna: I think those flowers are beautiful.                                                          Duke: See? The pretty girl understands.                                                             Luna: We mean you no harm, we promise you that. We're not here to cause trouble.                    Duke: That's good. I don't enjoy tearing apart pretty things. And you are pretty. I like your eyes. Luna: Aw, thank you so much! That’s very sweet of you, guys! And you both have very cute ears!      Burpee: *Cheeky laugh* Heheh, she said she likes our ears.                                          Duke: Heh, she's so cute, isn't she?                                                                Burpee: She's adorable! Should we take her to Fangrend?                                             Duke: We should!                                                                                    Burpee: I wanna ask Betty if we can keep her!                                                       Duke: Just be sure to keep her away from Tissle. I like this girl's smell as it is.                 Burpee: *Wheeze laugh* HAHAHAH, I still can't believe he was sprayed by that skunk.                 Duke: “You guys are such wimps. Let the alpha deal with it.”                                        Burpee: *Wheeze laugh* Hahahah, he's been smelling like shit for 4 days straight. *Laughs* Had to be fucking Tis.                                                                                       Duke: *Clears throat* Sorry about that. Yeah, we'd be happy to accompany you to meet our leader.    He's been itching for a chat with someone from outside the pack. Things have been... complicated    lately.                                                                                             Orion: Hmm... what do you think?                                                                    Luna: We should go for it! They seem friendly.                                                      Orion: *Chuckles* Yeah, they do seem pretty funny, not gonna lie. And... well, your hunch was       definitely right before, so I’ll follow your lead. Let's not take too long, though. We're supposed  to meet Penny back in Hollowbrook in 40 minutes.                                                    Luna: How long will the visit take?                                                                 Duke: Um... no more than 15 minutes. Just a quick stop, it won't...                                 Burpee: *Wheeze laugh* Hahahah dude, the face he made! S-Sorry, sorry, hahah, I remembered Tissle's incident again. Hahah...hah...o-okay, okay, *clears throat* I'm sorry. Let's get back on track.     Duke: ...it won't eat up much of your time, promise.                                                Orion: (Hmm... it seems like they're actually genuinely good fellas after all. At worst, I could    activate my powers and take Luna to a safe place before they even realized what was happening.)     Alright... let's meet him. But we have to be back in Hollowbrook within 30 minutes.                 Duke: Cool, follow us then.                                                                         Orion: Right behind you. (Let's see what this leader can tell us...)                                Duke and Burpee guide you through a labyrinth of diverse corridors within the ruins, culminating in a more spacious room on the uppermost floor.                                                        Duke: Alright, this is the place. I'll let the rest of the pack know you're here. I wouldn't want   anyone to kill you by accident.                                                                     Orion: A-Appreciate it.                                                                             Duke: *Howls*                                                                                       Orion: Are there many of you here? We didn't see anything when we–                                  Suddenly, dozens of werewolves materialize from every corner of the chamber, halting just before you with a curious gaze.                                                                               Orion: O-Okay.                                                                                      Luna: Wow!                                                                                          Werewolf: Who are these people, Duke?                                                               Duke: We found them on the road.                                                                    Werewolf: WHAT?! You brought strangers into our lair, you idiot?! How do we know they're not        enemies?!                                                                                           Burpee: It's alright, calm down, we have reasons to believe they're not hostile.                    Werewolf: They better be GOOD reasons!                                                              Burpee: They are! Look at the girl. She's so cute.                                                  Werewolf: . . . Okay, yeah, she's cute.                                                             Werewolf: Oof, I got scared for a moment.                                                           Werewolf: Yeah, that was close.                                                                     Werewolf: Oh my god, she's adorable!                                                                Burpee: Okay, let me introduce you to everyone. The humans are Luna and Orion. And they are... From left to right, Larry, Lupin, Biscuit, Bella, Pippin, Whisker, Happy, Flutter, Nimbus, Zigzag,       Noodle, and Gizmo.                                                                                  Luna: Pleasure to meet you all!                                                                     Orion: Y-Yeah, nice to meet you. (How the hell am I supposed to tell them apart...? They all look   exactly the same.)                                                                                  Betty: *Feminine voice* Burpee...? What's going on here?                                            Burpee: Ah, honey! Look at what I found! This super cute human was lost on the road! Look at how    tiny she is!                                                                                        Betty: No.                                                                                          Burpee: Her eyes remind me of... Wait, what? I didn't even ask anything yet!                        Betty: We can't keep her.                                                                           Burpee: What?! Why not?                                                                             Betty: Because a human isn't a pet. They have a lot of needs.                                       Burpee: But I'll take good care of her! I'll hunt food for her and take her for walks every day!    Betty: I said no, Burpee.                                                                           Burpee: Awwwhh... I'm sorry, Luna.                                                                  Luna: No worries, Burpee! We can be friends anyway!                                                 Larry: *Cheeky laugh* Looks like someone's wife has him on a tight leash.                           Burpee: I heard that, Larry!                                                                        Nimbus: *Sniffing* Ugh, what's that smell...?                                                       Larry: Oh god, not Tissle again...                                                                  Tissle: Oh, COME ON, guys! I don't smell anymore!                                                   Burpee: You're stinking up the place with your skunk stench, Tis! Go back to the river and get      washed again!                                                                                       Tissle: But the water is so cold!                                                                   Larry: He does have a point, that water is freezing.                                                Nimbus: Yeah, one of the drawbacks of having short fur.                                             Larry: Well, our northern cousins have long fur everywhere, but they get roasted during summer. I   don't know what's worse.                                                                            Nimbus: But they look cooler, like... actual wolves. We could pass as oversized Dobermans.          Larry: I prefer to say we look like descendants of Anubis.                                          Orion: (Anubis...?)                                                                                 Nimbus: What the fuck is an anubis?                                                                 Larry: The Egyptian deity, hello?                                                                   Nimbus: The what now?                                                                               Burpee: Yeah, stop making things up, Larry.                                                         Larry: I'm not making anything up, you bunch of illiterates! Ask the pretty girl!                   Luna: He's actually right! And I agree, you remind me of–                                           Fangrend: *Roars* WHAT ARE YOU ALL DOING HERE?! STOP SLACKING OFF AND GET BACK TO YOUR POSTS! NOW!  The entire pack swiftly disengages, obediently following their leader's commands as they sprint out of the chamber. Despite bearing the same appearance as his kin, Fangrend stands before you enveloped in an aura that renders him particularly daunting.                                                 Fangrend: Duke...? Burpee? You let hunters into our sanctuary?                                      Burpee: W-What do you mean h-hunters...? Y-You're hunters?                                          Orion: We're not! We just–                                                                          Fangrend: LIES! You're dressed in their garb!                                                       Orion: But we're not! It's all a ruse! We just came to these lands to investigate something, that's all!                                                                                                Fangrend: Do you know how many of us have fallen to those murderers since the hunt began?           Orion: We're not a part of it, I swear.                                                             Fangrend: . . . Hmph. I can hear your pulses, and they don’t indicate lies... so I'll let you live  today. Leave, and never come back.                                                                  Orion: Wait! I was hoping I could ask you a few questions before–                                   Fangrend: I have nothing to discuss with a human from outside our pack.                             Orion: We don't have to be enemies.                                                                 Fangrend: You're not even worthy to be here.                                                        Orion: Then let me prove you my worth!                                                              Fangrend: You? You're nothing but a frail human.                                                    Orion: I am not weak.                                                                               Fangrend: Hah. Overconfidence can be a dangerous quality, young man. Do you really think you could  best me in a duel?                                                                                  Orion: I could.                                                                                     Fangrend: Hah... Alright then. Prove your mettle. Defeat me in combat... and I'll address all of    your questions. You and me, in my human form. Even odds.                                            Orion: (A duel?)                                                                                    Accept                                                                                              Orion: I was thinking of fighting you in your wolf form.                                            Refuse                                                                                              Orion: We have better things to do than unnecessary fights.                                         Fangrend: Hah. So I thought. Now go, and never come back. Take them to the exit, Duke.              Orion: Rest assured, we won't come back.                                                            Luna: Goodbye, Burpee!                                                                              Burpee: B-Bye Luna. I'm sorry things turned out this way.                                           Luna: No worries! I'm sure we'll cross paths again.                                                 Burpee: That would be nice! You can visit us outside the camp anytime!                              Luna: Will do! Take care, guys!                                                                     Orion: In your human one? Even easier.                                                              Fangrend: Hahahah... I like you, boy. Hmmmmgh... *Standing up* Oooh boy, that felt good. *Cracking  his neck* It's been a while since I reverted to my human form. *Cracking his neck* I almost forgot  how refreshing it used to feel.                                                                     Orion: Well... (Is he really not gonna cover himself...?) *Clears throat* It's good to finally be   able to talk face-to-face. Can all of you shift into your human forms at will?                      Fangrend: You won't get any answers from me unless you defeat me in combat.                         Orion: Hmm. Okay then, I'm ready whenever you are. We're actually in a rush, so let's get this done quickly.                                                                                            Fangrend: Excellent. Disrobe and meet me in the main courtyard. We shall fight there.               Orion: Um... I'm sorry, do we have to fight... naked? Me too?                                       Fangrend: Mm-hm.                                                                                    Orion: I-I'm not sure I'm entirely comfortable with that.                                           Fangrend: Why not? Clothes are nothing but an unnecessary hindrance in battle, imposed on us by     those who are blind to the natural beauty of the beast! The art of combat should always be practiced by warriors adorned as they came into this world. In contact and one with nature! Well... that is, if your woman is okay with it, of course. We can make adjustments if she's not comfortable with it. I've gotta respect that.                                                                            Orion: (Oh, thank god.)                                                                             Luna: Nah, it's perfectly fine. Go on and strip. Don't worry, I couldn't care less.                 Orion: LUNA?! Y-YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY NO!                                                          Fangrend: Excellent then. Let us shed this wretched garb and commence battle.                       Orion: Um... *Sighs* I guess I have no other option. (Ending my Eternum session with a Gachimuchi   brawl... I definitely didn't see that one coming.) *Getting rid of your hunter robes* Okay, fuck it. Happy now?                                                                                         Fangrend: I will explain the rules. No elemental spells are allowed.                                Orion: Got it.                                                                                      Fangrend: No weapons of any sort either. Just our bare hands.                                       Orion: And how is the winner determined?                                                            Fangrend: Until the other surrenders or is knocked out.                                             Orion: Understood.                                                                                  Burpee: BETTY!                                                                                      Betty: W-W-WHAT, WHAT? WHAT'S HAPPENING!                                                            Burpee: You were looking at the human's penis!                                                      Betty: No, I wasn't!                                                                                Burpee: Yes, you were, I saw it!                                                                    Betty: I was looking at his butt!                                                                   Burpee: *Gasps* So you admit it!                                                                    Betty: M-Mere curiosity for human anatomy! I... um, s-stop making me waste my time with your human  penises and butts, Burpee!                                                                          Orion: (Was Luna looking too...? I kind of expected her to turn around.)                            Betty: Can you let me go back to my post??                                                          Fangrend: Calm down, guys. Yes, you can go back to your post, Betty. Duke and Burpee will handle    this. Well... it seems like this might cause unnecessary distraction. So it may be better if we just wear a simple loincloth during the combat exercise.                                                Orion: Oh thank goodness, yes, please.                                                              Fangrend: Follow me to the courtyard. I wouldn't want to make you waste more time.                  Orion: After you.                                                                                   You wear the rags provided by Fangrend and go with him to the courtyard, followed by Luna, Burpee,  and Duke.                                                                                           Fangrend: So... are you ready?                                                                      Orion: Absolutely.                                                                                  Fangrend: Your overconfidence is admirable. I wonder how long it lasts. Have you never lost a       battle?                                                                                             Orion: I have. And that only made me stronger.                                                      Fangrend: HAHA! That's the spirit of a true champion! Alright boy, let's fight!                     Luna: You don't have to do this, Orion. We can go back to Hollowbrook and figure out what to do with Penny.                                                                                             Orion: Don't worry, Luna, I got this. (This man is no ordinary NPC. None of them are. They each have their own motives, they never repeat themselves, and they're willing to fight back if they have to. All of them broke free from Ulysses' control somehow, and I need to find out how. But he's strong. I must be careful.) Okay... Ready whenever you are.                                                 Fangrend: Wow, you hardly look human anymore!                                                       Orion: Just a little power boost. Is that okay?                                                     Fangrend: Absolutely! As long as you only use your fists.                                           Orion: Of course. (He's way bigger than me. This would be a good moment to remember Dalia's advice  for close combat against larger opponents... Now, what was it... Hmmm... Dammit, I'm not sure how to approach him. Maybe if Dalia had taken the time to train me on how to fight against taller         opponents, like she had mentioned...) *Panting* O-Okay, okay... *Panting* That's... 200 pushups.    Dalia: Nice job, Orion. Each time you do better than the last! Soon you'll be carrying us all to the throne of Eternum.                                                                                 Orion: *Recovering your breath* Hah... so that's your plan, eh? You're basically just using me?     Dalia: It's mutually beneficial! You bring the muscle, and we bring the brains! And... some more    muscle.                                                                                             Orion: *Chuckles* Fair enough.                                                                      Dalia: Alright, listen up! You need to learn how to face opponents bigger than you. This is crucial. Thanatos is like... two feet taller than you, so your usual approach won't cut it.                 Orion: O-Okay, but can I sit down while you explain the theory?                                     Dalia: Fine, fine, sit and catch your breath... but pay attention!                                  Orion: *Sighs* Oof, thank goodness.                                                                 Dalia: Okay, imagine this pile of straw is Thanatos.                                                Orion: Mm-hm.                                                                                       Dalia: Basically, you're up against an opponent as quick as you, but larger and taller.             Orion: Mm-hm...                                                                                     Dalia: So you must outsmart him with technique! You can't just charge in like a wild bull.          Orion: Aha.                                                                                         Dalia: So try this move: you fake a kick to his right side like this, and when he tries to protect  himself from it... BAM! You quickly shift your weight and kick his left ear with your other foot!   With his left ear discombobulated, he won't be able to react for a few seconds!                     Orion: (Jesus Lord almighty, these shorts can't be legal. I mean... have you seen that?! The perfect shape. Not a hint of imperfection, not a trace of cellulite. And boy, was it soft that one time... She really–)                                                                                        Dalia: Are you paying attention?                                                                    Orion: Y-YES!                                                                                       Dalia: What did I just say?                                                                         Orion: You discombobulate the left ear.                                                             Dalia: And then?                                                                                    Orion: You... Discombobulate... the... ...right leg?                                                Dalia: . . .                                                                                        Orion: I'm planning to make discombobulation my signature move.                                     Dalia: Well, I had a surprise for you at the end of this training. but since you don't seem to care, I won't bother.                                                                                    Orion: Awh, no! Please, I love surprises!                                                           Dalia: You've missed your chance.                                                                   Orion: Come on, Dalia! What is it?                                                                  Dalia: I won't tell you.                                                                            Orion: Give me another shot!                                                                        Dalia: Hmm. Okay, do 300 pushups in a row and I might consider giving you a second chance.          Orion: 300 pushups in a row?! Today?!                                                               Dalia: You have one week to pull it off.                                                            Orion: One week, huh... If you promise I’ll still get the surprise afterwards, I'll do those 300    pushups. I'll train harder than ever.                                                               Dalia: We'll see about that... Just try to stay focused for once.                                   Orion: You're perfectly aware of what you're doing, aren't you?                                     Dalia: Who, me...? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just trying to get the best out of   you. Can’t have you getting distracted during a big fight...                                        Orion: *Chuckles* Of course... (Goddammit, Dalia needs to stop wearing those shorts to our          trainings. I get distracted way too easily.)                                                        Fangrend: Before we start, though... I have a question for you. How confident are you in your       victory?                                                                                            Orion: I'm... highly confident. Why?                                                                Fangrend: Confident enough to raise the stakes?                                                     Orion: Raising it how...?                                                                           Fangrend: Elevating it to... A fight to the death.                                                  Orion: I'm sorry?                                                                                   Fangrend: If you win, I will embrace death, and my entire pack will be at your service forever. You will assume my mantle as their leader, forging them into your personal army. Yet, if I win... you   and your companion must also embrace the end.                                                       Orion: Are you talking about Luna? She has nothing to do with this.                                 Fangrend: This is the essence of being a part of a pack, young man. You are one. When one falls, all fall with them. If you can't understand this, then we have nothing to discuss. The door is open for you to leave. Now... make your choice.                                                             Accept                                                                                              Orion: Fine, I accept. A fight the the death.                                                       Fangrend: I see. Are you sure?                                                                      Orion: I already said yes. Now shut up and face me already. I'm starting to get sick of you.        Keep Luna out of it                                                                                 Orion: Keep Luna out of it and you've got a deal. If I lose, only I have to die.                    Fangrend: That's not an option. You're a pack. You are one.                                         Orion: Then I guess we're done here. Let's leave this place, Luna.                                  Fangrend: Hah! Just like that? Weren't you so sure of your victory?                                 Orion: And I am. But you seem confident too. You might have an ace up your sleeve, or play dirty, I don't know. I won't jeopardize the lives of the ones I love, under any circumstances.               Fangrend: Very well. Your choice has been made.                                                     Luna: . . .                                                                                         Burpee: Awww, did you hear that, Luna? That was so cute! Your boyfriend really loves you, huh?      Luna: W-We... I mean, he's not my boyfriend.                                                        Burpee: Oh. So you're already married? So young?                                                    Luna: That's not what I mean, we're not...                                                          Duke: You dumbass, can't you see they're not dating yet?                                            Burpee: What do you mean? Really?                                                                   Duke: Of course not! It's obvious that they like each other, but they're not there yet.             Burpee: Ahh...                                                                                      Duke: You just have to see the way they look at each other for a second, Burp.                      Burpee: Oh, forgive me for not being a human sociologist, Duke.                                     Duke: This is why you can't appreciate the little delicate things.                                  Burpee: Not this again! I swear I'll eat all those flowers of yours!                                Duke: DON'T YOU DARE!                                                                               Orion: *Looking at Luna* (What are they all mumbling about?)                                        Luna: We're not bad people. We just want to help.                                                   Orion: *Looking at Luna* Yeah, she's right. We–                                                     Fangrend: Congrats, Orion. You passed the test.                                                     Refuse                                                                                              Orion: I refuse.                                                                                    Fangrend: Hah! You're scared now?                                                                   Orion: It's not about fear. I won't jeopardize our lives over something trivial like this.          Fangrend: Weren't you so sure of your victory?                                                      Orion: And I am. But you seem confident too. You might have an ace up your sleeve, or play dirty, I don't know. Even if there's only a 1% chance of losing... death’s not a risk worth taking. So...    yeah, we're done here. Let's get out of here, Luna.                                                 Fangrend: Very well. Your choice has been made. And with this... The fight is over. You win.        Orion: Huh? Wait, what...? What do you mean, it's over?                                             Fangrend: You didn't pass the test. I'm afraid I have nothing else to discuss with you.             Orion: What...? What test?                                                                          Luna: But why? We agreed to all your terms.                                                         Orion: Exactly! Why–                                                                                Fangrend: *Appearing behind you* That was not the point of this little performance.                 Orion: W-What... how did you move so fast...?                                                       Fangrend: Bargaining with the lives of your pack members is a non-starter.                          Orion: I'm not trading shit, I would have defeated you!                                             Fangrend: You can't be certain of that.                                                             Orion: *Cocky laugh* Oh, believe me, I'm sure of it.                                                Fangrend: You're entirely missing the point here.                                                   Orion: And what about “when one falls, all fall with them” and all that bullshit?                   Fangrend: Again, you're missing the point. Now, please, leave.                                      Orion: But–                                                                                         Fangrend: Leave.                                                                                    Orion: Bah! Fine! Let's get out of here, Luna. We won't get anything out of these... broken NPCs. I was probably mistaken earlier about them being different from the typical ones.                     Luna: O-Okay. Bye guys... good luck.                                                                Duke: Thanks Luna!                                                                                  Burpee: Please take care!                                                                           Orion: Thanks for nothing, I guess. We'll go back to Hollowbrook. Hopefully we'll find more rational people there.                                                                                      Fangrend: May the winds blow in your favor.                                                         Orion: . . . Yeah, thanks... Let's go, Luna. What do you mean, I win? We didn't fight.              Luna: So... this was just a test?                                                                   Orion: *Looking at Luna* A test?                                                                    Fangrend: Indeed, and you passed it.                                                                Orion: Getting away from him* W-WHAT THE... (What the hell... I only looked away for a second! How  did he move so fast?! I didn't even sense his presence until he touched my shoulder...) A-And what  do you mean I passed the test?!                                                                     Fangrend: You were willing to face me, that was the first step. Yet, you refused to fight if it     meant risking the loss of one of your own. The pack and the individual are one. The well-being of   our people must always be our ultimate priority. Always.                                            Orion: Huh... very sneaky.                                                                          Fangrend: Welcome to the pack, Orion.                                                               Orion: Um... thank you. I'm... honored. (To be honest, he never gave me a bad feeling. I'm relieved to see he's a good man and I don't have to actually fight him.)                                     Fangrend: We've all wasted enough of your time, so you're free to go now. Although you mentioned you had questions earlier, so feel free to ask before you leave.                                       Orion: I appreciate it. (Mmm, I should get straight to the point. Penny must be already waiting for us.) Okay... Well, I'd love to stay and continue asking you questions, but we really must be on our way now.                                                                                            Can I be a werewolf?                                                                                Orion: You mentioned we're considered members of the pack now. Does that mean that... we can become werewolves?                                                                                         Fangrend: Becoming a werewolf is a grueling, painful process, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. You see, we were originally created as weapons for combat, a long time ago. We were treated like   animals for so long that most of us have forgotten how to shift back into our human forms. I'm one  of the few remaining who can switch at will. The rest of the pack, including Burpee and Duke, are   bound to their wolf forms until I can find a way to reverse the curse.                              Orion: Damn, that's not quite the fantastical picture I had in my mind. I truly hope you can find a cure one day.                                                                                       What memories do you have of your past?                                                             Orion: What memories do you have of your past? Before arriving here.                                Fangrend: We all come from the northern regions of Ekabar. I've spent the last few years traveling  across the continent in hopes of finding a cure.                                                    Orion: And what about... Egypt? One of your brothers mentioned it earlier. He even spoke of one of  their gods.                                                                                         Fangrend: Egypt...? Um... I'm afraid I've never come across that name... I think.                   Orion: Do you know what “Eternum” is? Or Ulysses? Or things like... Europe, Asia, or America?       Fangrend: Uh... no, those terms don't ring a bell. Despite covering thousands of kilometers in our  travels, Ekabar is all we've known. We have no idea of what lies beyond the great seas, I'm sorry.  Orion: No worries... (One of the werewolves mentioned Egypt and Anubis. I heard it. Could their     actual memories from the real world be merging with the fabricated ones they acquired when they     became NPCs? Perhaps that's the trigger that can “free” them from Ulysses' control? I’ll have to    note that for later...)                                                                             What's your current relationship with the town of Hollowbrook?                                      Orion: What's your current relationship with the town of Hollowbrook?                               Fangrend: If you've been there recently, you'll probably notice that it's... become strained. Their hunters began targeting us without any provocation when we sought medicine from them. We've been    doing our best to steer clear of them, but if they encroach on our hideout... we'll defend          ourselves. We're planning to relocate again in a few days, so hopefully it won't come to that.      Orion: Understandable. (I wonder what triggered this sudden shift in behavior among the NPCs. Did   the hunters go rogue first? Or perhaps it was the werewolves? They're clearly not following any     prescribed path anymore. Hmmm...)                                                                   Leave                                                                                               Orion: Well, I'd love to stay and continue asking you questions, but we really must be on our way   now. I hope we can continue our conversation sometime.                                              Fangrend: Very well. It was a pleasure meeting you, Orion and Luna. I also hope we have the chance  to meet again in the future.                                                                        Orion: Oh, before we leave...                                                                       Side with the hunters                                                                               Orion: You should know that, if you truly wish to cure your brothers, Hollowbrook is your best bet. We crossed paths with the hunters upon our arrival, and they were leaving the town for good. Now    only a handful of civilians remain, and among them there's a shaman. Perhaps she knows how to help  them return to their human form.                                                                    Fangrend: Oh... really? That's excellent news indeed. I'll send someone to pay them a visit soon,   then.                                                                                               Orion: (Hopefully this will lead to a truce and to us becoming friends with the hunters of          Hollowbrook.) Good.                                                                                 Side with the werewolves                                                                            Orion: You should know that we passed through Hollowbrook on our way here, and I can tell you the   hunters have lost all reason. They believe you're all malevolent creatures that must be eradicated. If you wish to help your brothers, you'd be better off far from that town of lunatics.              Fangrend: Thanks for the advice, we'll steer clear of it. It's not something we aren't used to by   now. I understand that our appearance can be intimidating and instill fear. Thanks again for your   help, Orion.                                                                                        Orion: No problem. And best of luck.                                                                Luna: Bye guys! Take care! It was so nice to meet you!                                              Burpee: BYE LUNA!                                                                                   Duke: PLEASE PROMISE US YOU'LL VISIT!                                                               Burpee: AND TAKE CARE OUT THERE!                                                                    Duke: I'LL PREPARE A FLOWER BOUQUET FOR WHENEVER YOU'RE BACK!                                       Luna: I'll be looking forward to it!                                                                Orion: *Chuckles* (I'll miss those guys.) *Sighs* Damn, that took waaaaay too long. Penny is gonna  think we're pushing up daisies. Luna is gonna think we're pushing up daisies. And what's worse, it  was all a huge waste of time. It's obvious that those are not normal NPCs and they behave like real people, but we didn't learn anything about why or how they broke free of their rails.               Luna: I don't think it was a waste of time! We made new allies! I'm sure Fangrend, Duke, and Burpee would have our backs in the future if we ever needed them.                                          Orion: Hmm, perhaps you're right.                                                                   Luna: And even if not, we made new friends, at least.                                               Orion: *Chuckles* I guess. I love how you always find the silver lining in every situation.         Luna: Now let's meet up with Penny! I'm curious to hear if she's actually found the vampires... and if they were as nice as the werewolves.                                                             Penelope: I don't think it was a waste of time! We gained some new allies! I'm sure Lord Illiescu   and his wife would be willing to help us out in the future if we ever need it. Maybe just... in     exchange for another dance.                                                                         Orion: *Chuckles* Perhaps you're right. I just hope that curse doesn't mess with their heads too.   Penelope: I certainly hope so too! I'll do a bit of digging on my own about that curse, see if I can find any leads on what's happening to them. I’ve been studying all these old tomes, so maybe I can find a clue!                                                                                        Orion: (She's got such a kind heart. Most people wouldn't give a shit.)                             Penelope: Now let's meet up with Luna! I'm dying to know if she had any luck with those werewolves! Orion: Yep! Let's go! Hollowbrook should be right behind the next–                                  You abruptly turn around, sensing a presence lurking in the shadows.                                Orion: . . .                                                                                        Luna: Orion? What's wrong?                                                                          Orion: . . . *Whispering* We're being followed.                                                     Luna: What? Since when?                                                                             Orion: I'm not sure. But I can feel it. You go on ahead and wait for me in Hollowbrook, Penny must  be beside herself with worry by now.                                                                Luna: What? And leave you here?                                                                     Orion: Don't worry, I'll handle it. Actually, just wait for me next to the Exit Portal. I'll join   you as soon as I can. It's probably just a lost villager or... some other NPC.                      Luna: Are you sure...?                                                                              Orion: Absolutely.                                                                                  Luna: Well... okay then. But if you're not at the Exit Portal by the time we get there, we are      coming to find you.                                                                                 Orion: I'll be there!                                                                               Luna: Okay... Be careful.                                                                           Luna continues walking down the path until she disappears over the hill. You stand in the middle of the pathway in complete silence, waiting for what feels like an eternity.                           Penelope: Orion? What's wrong?                                                                      Orion: . . . *Whispering* We're being followed.                                                     Penelope: What? Since when?                                                                         Orion: I'm not sure. But I can feel it. You go on ahead and wait for me in Hollowbrook, Luna must be beside herself with worry by now.                                                                  Penelope: What? And leave you here?                                                                 Orion: Don't worry, I'll handle it. Actually, just wait for me next to the Exit Portal. I'll join   you as soon as I can. It's probably just a lost villager or... some other NPC.                      Penelope: Are you sure...?                                                                          Orion: Absolutely.                                                                                  Penelope: Well... okay then. But if you're not at the Exit Portal by the time we get there, we are  coming to find you.                                                                                 Orion: I'll be there!                                                                               Penelope: Okay... Be careful.                                                                       Penelope continues walking down the path until she disappears over the hill. You stand in the middle of the pathway in complete silence, waiting for what feels like an eternity.                       Orion: . . . So, are you gonna come out, or what?                                                   . . .                                                                                               Orion: Look, I don't have all day. If you want something from me, speak up now. If not, I'll be on  my way.                                                                                             . . .                                                                                               Orion: (I definitely sense a presence around... But at the same time, I don't sense any bad         intentions. They're not a threat, they mean no harm. I just... know it. Every day that passes I feel more connected to Eternum. Even when I'm not actively using my powers. It's like I can... feel the world around me. I wouldn't be able to explain it with words to anyone, even if I tried with all my might.)                                                                                             . . .                                                                                               Orion: Very well, I'll head out, then. But I’m warning you, stop following me or you'll face the    consequences. Got it?                                                                               . . .                                                                                               Orion: (Bah, I'm wasting my time. They're probably just a lost NPC. Let's meet up with the girls in town and call it a day.)                                                                            You follow Luna's path and head towards Hollowbrook, feeling the presence fade the further you move away from the woods. You follow Penelope's path and head towards Hollowbrook, feeling the presence  fade the further you move away from the woods.                                                      ???: . . .                                                                                          Penelope: (Hmmm... looks like there's nobody around yet. I truly hope Orion and Luna are okay. I    truly hope Luna is okay. Perhaps the werewolves weren't as “welcomingly eccentric” as the           vampires.)                                                                                          Hunter: Thomas, grab your sword, quickly!                                                           Penelope: (Hmm?)                                                                                    Hunter: Huh? Why?                                                                                   Hunter: I've found it! I know where the Centaurs are hiding! In the forest!                         Hunter: So what?                                                                                    Hunter: What do you mean, so what? Arm yourself and let's go! They must be eradicated.              Hunter: But... I mean, what have the centaurs ever done to us?                                      Hunter: Have you forgotten the teachings of Father Bakhar? Magic is a malevolent force, a temptation from the devil in this world. We are but instruments of God, and as such, we must cleanse the world from the Dark Lord's influence.                                                                    Hunter: I remember them...                                                                          Hunter: Then shut up and let's go.                                                                  Hunter: Alright...                                                                                  Penelope: (As I imagined, none of the creatures that live in the woods have harmed the villagers.   They've taken up this crusade against magic solely because of this 'Father Bakhar'... I need to find Orion and Luna as soon as possible and warn them...                                                Luna: I don't see Penny anywhere. I hope she's alright. I don't see Orion or Penny anywhere. I hope they're alright. Perhaps I should just head to the Exit Portal? The sun is about to rise.)          The sound of a girl sobbing emanates from a nearby building.                                        Luna: (A girl... crying?)                                                                           Luna steps into the weathered building, following the sound of weeping.                             Luna: (It looks like an old inn.)                                                                   Girl: *Cries*                                                                                       Luna cautiously approaches the source of the sound, only to find a small girl huddled in front of a flickering candle.                                                                                  Girl: *Sobbing* I-I'll never stay out late again, I promise...                                      Luna: *Sitting next to her* Hello! Are you okay? Why are you crying?                                Girl: *Gasps* E-Eh? W-Who are you?                                                                  Luna: My name is Luna. And you?                                                                     Girl: . . .                                                                                         Sybilla: S-Sybilla. Are you also a hunter?                                                          Luna: Not exactly. I'm just visiting, but I'm a friend! Why are you here all by yourself?           Sybilla: I... *Sniffs* O-Our dog Rub ran off right before sunset, so I went out to search for him.  B-But then I got lost and ended up here and couldn’t make it back home before dark. We can't go out at night due to the monsters in the streets, s-so... I have to wait until dawn.                     Luna: I see. Well, then we'll wait together!                                                        Sybilla: Wait? Together...? *Sobbing* It won't work. They'll find us. That's what my mom said.      Luna: . . . You know, this almost feels like deja-vu!                                               Sybilla: W-What? What's a dejafu?                                                                   Luna: It's like when you feel you've already experienced something before. I once met a little girl named Anne, just like you, who was also scared and all alone in a big, dark house because she lost  her mom. And do you know what happened?                                                             Sybilla: What...?                                                                                   Luna: She found her! They were reunited again and everyone was safe!                                Sybilla: Really...?                                                                                 Luna: Absolutely!                                                                                   Sybilla: Oh... *Going back to crying* B-But-but... *Sobbing* That won't happen to me. *Sobbing* The monsters will eat me. *Sobbing* And I'll be gone forever, just like daddy when he left the town.    Luna: . . . Hmmm... Increarbus Severum.                                                             Maurice: *Bleats*                                                                                   Sybilla: Huh...? A... a goat? How did it get here?                                                  Zippy: *Jumping on top of Maurice* Hello Sybil!                                                     Sybilla: Uhh? Who are you?

Maurice: *Bleats*                                                                                   Sybilla: Nice... to meet you too. What are you??

Zippy: Actually, Rub told me that you were here all by yourself, and he asked me if I could come and hang out with you until the sun comes up! Isn't that cool?!                                        Sybilla: You know Rub?!                                                                             Zippy: I do! We’re great friends! He's always telling us all how great his human owner is!

Sybilla: What? What does that mean?                                                                 Zippy: *Jumping on top of the table* Hello Sybil!

Zippy: *Patting Maurice* Indeed, he is! This is my trusty steed Maurice! Though he's quite          independent, so I prefer to think of us as friends, instead of pet and master!

You're... You're a monstrosity.                                                                     Luna's Mom: You're a monster, Luna.                                                                 Sybilla's mother: An abomination. An abomination.                                                   Luna: *Breathing heavily* . . .                                                                     Sybilla's mother: Let's get out of here, Sybil.                                                     Sybilla: But–                                                                                       Sybilla's mother forcefully pulls her daughter out of the building.                                 Sybilla's mother: Hunters! There's a witch right here inside the inn!                               Hunter: What?!                                                                                      Sybilla's mother: Kill her! Burn the building down!                                                 Hunter: Call the others!                                                                            Luna: . . .                                                                                         Orion: (Alright, here we are. Back where we started. I don't see the girls anywhere though, maybe–) Out of nowhere, a hunter kicks the door beside you wide open.                                       Hunter: You bastard...                                                                              Orion: *Putting your hands up* Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy there, buddy!                                 Hunter: You... You were with the witch, weren't you?!                                               Orion: What...? (Shit... I better play dumb for now.) What witch?                                   Hunter: The woman that rolled in with you. The one with the red eyes!                               Orion: Ah, her... yeah, we met in a nearby town. I was skeptical at first too, but it turns out red eyes are a thing in the southern isles where she's from.                                            Hunter: Pff, you should learn not to be so gullible. She's actually a witch. One of our men caught  her casting magic, trying to lure children to devour!                                               Orion: You're kidding...                                                                            Hunter: No joke.                                                                                    Orion: That... h-hussy... I can't believe I fell for her trickery! I will rip her guts out myself!  Hunter: You can help us find her, if you want. She fled after we nabbed her, but she can't be too   far.                                                                                                Orion: I'll start searching immediately.                                                            Hunter: If you do find her... kill her. We don't keep monsters prisoners.                           Orion: Understood.                                                                                  The hunter leaves in a hurry.                                                                       Orion: (Oof, that was close... I've gotta find Luna before these psychos do. But... fuck, where     could she have gone? Was there a specific building she talked about?) Hmm... (Fuck, I don't think   she did. I might as well check out the church. She seems like the kind of girl who'd enjoy dark,    creepy churches.) *Sighs* (Please be there, Luna...)                                                The old barn                                                                                        Orion: (Maybe the barn? When we arrived, she had mentioned hiding in an old barn when she first     started playing Eternum. Please be there, Luna...)                                                  The windmill                                                                                        Orion: (Maybe the windmill? I have to start somewhere, I guess. Please be there, Luna...)           The church                                                                                          Orion: (Maybe the church? I have to start somewhere, I guess. Please be there, Luna...)             You stroll through the streets of Hollowbrook, dodging the patrols of hunters, until you stumble    upon what appears to be an old barn.                                                                Orion: (It has to be this one. I remember passing through here before going to find her and the     werewolves, it was chock-full of hay bales and farm machinery. I remember passing through here      before going to find Penny and the vampires, it was chock-full of hay bales and farm machinery.)    Clutching your lantern tightly, you cautiously step into the dark building.                         Orion: (Okay...) *Whispering* Luna? *Whispering* It's me, Orion!                                    . . .                                                                                               Orion: (I should scope out the upper floors before trying another building. This seems to be the    attic. Not much to see, though. Must've been a rough year for crops. Which... probably didn't do    much to quell the collective hysteria.) *Looking around* Luna? Are you in here? It's Orion!         You catch a soft noise behind the nearby barrels.                                                   Luna: Orion?                                                                                        Orion: Luna! Oh, thank god!                                                                         Luna: *Standing up* What are you doing here? How did you find me?                                   Orion: Remember when we got to Hollowbrook, and you told me about your thing for hiding out in old  barns when you started playing Eternum? I... well, I figured I'd start my search here.              Luna: Ah... that was smart.                                                                         Orion: I saw the whole village going nuts, on the hunt for a 'red-eyed' witch, and it had me        seriously freaking out.                                                                             Luna: Thank you for trying to find me, Orion. But no worries, I'm okay!                             Orion: I know how powerful you are, I've seen it. But I also know you're way too kind to harm most  people. Even if they're trying to kill you. So I was worried you could be in danger because of      that.                                                                                               Luna: I managed to slip in here without being seen, so it's all good now. If they're not looking for you, you should log off with Penny. I'll be alright, seriously. I'll leave quietly when the sun's  up; there can't be much time left.                                                                  Stay with her                                                                                       Orion: (I know both Luna and Penny can hold their own against these hunters.)                       Leave                                                                                               Orion: But... I mean, are you really sure about this?                                               Luna: Of course! Penny's probably freaked too, you should try to find her.                          Orion: Well... yeah, I suppose she's likely worried or even in some kind of danger. Hmmm... Fine,   I'll trust you. But promise me you'll watch your back! And text me THE SECOND you log off!          Luna: I will! I promise.                                                                            Orion: (I guess she's right, she can handle herself better than Penny. I should go find her and     ditch this cursed town once and for all.) Alright then, let's do that. Take care of yourself!       Luna: You too!                                                                                      Orion: (I hope I'm making the right call here. But I feel like right now, it's not about physical   danger. I remember how tough it was for Luna the last time she was called a monster, back at        Warthogs. I can't just leave her on her own. Not now.)                                              You take a seat on the floor and set your lantern down beside you.                                  Orion: Well, in that case, we'll wait together until dawn! Like you said, there can't be much time  left. Shhh! You're not allowed to talk unless you sit right here next to me!                        Luna: . . . *Giggles*                                                                               Orion: Ah! A sincere smile! I like that better!                                                     Luna: It's just that... I said the exact same thing to a little girl I came across earlier.         Orion: And did she listen?                                                                          Luna: Yeah, she did.                                                                                Orion: See? You're not going to let a little kid teach you how to behave, are you? Come on!         Luna: *Chuckles* Hmm.                                                                               You and Luna settle down together, passing the time as you wait for the sun to rise. Following a bit of casual conversation, a comfortable silence envelops the moment.                                 Orion: . . .                                                                                        Luna: . . . (I don't know what else to talk about. I've never been good at making conversation. He's probably figuring out that I'm not the most exciting company. Probably... regretting spending his  free time here. I can't blame him.                                                                  Orion: Hmm, these barrels are quite big. I could probably squeeze myself into one. Perhaps I could  take them to the river and go down the rapids like in The Hobbit...? What if I got stuck inside     though? Hmm, I gotta think about this...)                                                           Luna: So... um... I'm sorry.                                                                        Orion: Hhm...? What for?                                                                            Luna: Well, making you stay here in complete silence. I-I know it's surely not the most exciting way to spend your time in Eternum.                                                                     Orion: First of all, you didn't make me do anything, I'm here with you because I want to be. And    secondly, I've always said there are two types of silence. The awkward kind, and the good kind, like now! The difference lies in the person you're with. When you find someone with whom you can stay in silence and everything feels right... you can't let them go.                                       Luna: *Chuckles* Yeah... I like that. You always know what to say. I wish I had your gift with      words.                                                                                              Orion: You don't need it. Everyone is different, and you're amazing just the way you are. But trust me, I don't have a gift with words either. *Chuckles* I wouldn't find myself in so many sticky      predicaments if I did.                                                                              Luna: Yes, you do! You're... I mean... I never thought I'd find someone I could trust as much as my dad, but with you... I feel like I can share anything without being judged, you know? And it's not  just because my power doesn't work on you. You make me feel... safe.                                Orion: (I don't recall Luna opening up so freely about her feelings before. It feels nice.)         Luna: I've never had many friends, but now I have so many! And it's all thanks to you! You bring us all together.                                                                                       Orion: You don't need me for that! Your personality just naturally draws everyone in and makes them love you. It’s like you have a magnetic aura or something!                                          Luna: Hmm. I guess I've always... pushed people away since I was little. I sort of learned that     being alone was... easier. Even before we moved to Kredon.                                          Orion: You didn't grow up in Kredon? What was that like?                                            Luna: . . .                                                                                         Teacher: Alright kids, you can go now! Don't forget to prepare for the math exam on Monday! And have a good evening!                                                                                    Luna: . . .                                                                                         Kid: Trying to find your next victim, monster?                                                      Luna: Hmm?                                                                                          Kid: Isn't one dead dog enough?? You want to kill another one?                                      Luna: I didn't kill your dog.                                                                       Kid: That's bull! She killed him! It happened exactly like I told you! She said my dog would die,   and a truck hit him a week after!                                                                   Luna: T-That's why I told you to keep him inside the house during the weekend! I just wanted to help you prevent it.                                                                                    Kid: Shut up, monster! Hope you get hit by a truck too!                                             Luna: . . . *Putting her things back in the bag* . . .                                              Kid: *Throwing a pencil at her* Bullseye!                                                           Kid: Hahahaha!                                                                                      Kid: Looks like objects can't go through her.                                                       Kid: At least we know she's not a ghost! Hahaha!                                                    Kid: Come on, let's leave the freak here all alone.                                                 Luna: . . .                                                                                         Teacher: Do you know Luna Hernandez?                                                                Teacher: The Mexican kid?                                                                           Teacher: Yes.                                                                                       Teacher: Yeah, she's always sitting in the back, never talks to anyone. She kind of weirds me out,  honestly. And what's the deal with those red contacts?                                              Teacher: They're not contact lenses! Turns out that's her real eye color!                           Teacher: Are you serious? Hah, that's even creepier!                                                Teacher: And that's not all, they say she supposedly killed her own mother a few years back, but    obviously she was never convicted because she was only five years old at the time.                  Teacher: *Laughs* Come on, that's gotta be a made-up story.                                         Teacher: *Chuckles* I don't know, but I'm not about to ask her, just in case. I don't wanna be      jinxed.                                                                                             Teacher: *Chuckles* Fair enough.                                                                    Teacher: I heard she's moving to Kredon in a couple of weeks or something.                          Teacher: *Laughs* Oh, thank goodness. There're enough little demons in my class already, I don't    need a real one!                                                                                    Teacher: *Laughs* Tell me about it!                                                                 Luna: . . . . . .                                                                                   Mr. Hernandez: Luna.                                                                                Luna: . . .                                                                                         Mr. Hernandez: Luna?                                                                                Luna: . . .                                                                                         Mr. Hernandez: Luna!                                                                                Luna: Huh? Yes, Dad?                                                                                Mr. Hernandez: *Kneeling next to her* Are you okay, sweetie?                                        Luna: Yeah... why?                                                                                  Mr. Hernandez: You've been a bit... distracted lately. Less cheerful than usual. Is everything      alright at school?                                                                                  Luna: At... school...? . . . ...Yeah! Everything's awesome!                                         Mr. Hernandez: Are you sure, princess? You know you can tell me anything, right? If something       happened...                                                                                         Luna: I know, Dad! But everything is going okay, I swear! Today was so much fun!                    Mr. Hernandez: *Sad chuckle* Hmm. Alright then, so tell me, do you like the house?                  Luna: I love it! Are we gonna live here from now on?                                                Mr. Hernandez: Yes, we will! And you know what that means? I'm gonna be muuuch closer to the cafe   now! So we'll have more time to play together! How does that sound?                                 Luna: Awesome!                                                                                      Mr. Hernandez: And the first thing I'll do... is learn how to braid your hair! I know Mom used to be the one in charge of that, but I'll try my best!                                                   Luna: Super! . . . I learned to always smile, even when I wasn't feeling it. I learned to hide my   emotions, to always maintain the same expression no matter what was going on inside my head. I      learned that... life was a tad less complicated when I flew under the radar. I... You know, I       started playing Eternum because here I didn't feel judged for what I was or how I acted. In this    world, things are so weird that I can just blend in. But in the end... I suppose I took everything  too far. In the end... I guess I’m a monster in both worlds.                                        You grasp Luna and pin her against the haystack, where she remains motionless, looking straight into your eyes.                                                                                         Orion: NO!                                                                                          Luna: W-What?                                                                                       Orion: I can understand feelings of insecurity, confusion, or sadness, but I won't stand by while   you deceive yourself! You are no monster, Luna! Not here, not in the real world, and not on Mars.   Luna: O-Okay.                                                                                       Orion: There's no worse feeling than trying to help someone you love and being unable to do so! So, I need you to do your part too! You're literally the kindest and most gentle soul I've ever met, and you have to see that! So from now on, you're gonna be absolutely transparent with me!              Luna: O-Okay.                                                                                       Orion: No more fake smiles, no more hiding emotions, no more not saying what you really think! When we're alone, you're gonna be the REAL you! If you're sad, tell me. If you're angry, tell me. And if something worries you, tell me!                                                                     Luna: O-Okay.                                                                                       Orion: Promise me!                                                                                  Luna: I... I promise.                                                                               Orion: Okay. Good. Hmph.                                                                            Luna: . . .                                                                                         Orion: . . . (Um... alright, now I'm not sure how to proceed.) *Looking at Luna's eyes* (God, she   truly is beautiful. I want to kiss her again so bad. But it's probably not the right time, she'd    think I'm trying to take advantage of her vulnerable state.) *Assessing your own posture* (And...   shit, now that I think about it, I kinda look like I'm trying to assault her. I-Is this why she's   not saying anything??) *Clears throat* Alright, now that we've settled that... Let's go back to     town. We probably can–                                                                              Luna leans in quickly and catches your lips with a sudden kiss.                                     Orion: (W-What? How... Why... I don't...)                                                           Your thoughts and concerns fade as you eagerly return the kiss, drawing closer to Luna.             Orion: (Fuck it...)                                                                                 Luna: Mmmm...                                                                                       Without breaking the kiss, you effortlessly lift Luna from the floor, carrying her towards the      nearby barrels.                                                                                     Luna: Mmmmhh...                                                                                     Orion: *Dropping her on top of the barrels* Wow... That sure was unexpected.                        Luna: I'm sorry, I just had a–                                                                      Orion: Oh, don't you dare apologize! That was amazing. I just didn't expect you to take the lead, it caught me off guard.                                                                               Luna: I just felt like I wanted to do it. So... I did it. You told me I had to open myself to you   and be the real me from now on, so...                                                               Orion: Ahh, I dig that. Anything else you want to share with me, miss? What made you want to kiss me so bad?                                                                                            Luna: *Giggles playfully* Well... I guess your words got me. You're always caring, funny, confident, intelligent, and you share my quirky hobbies. Being with you is simply... fun. And, uh, you're     also... handsome. And... like... S-Super hot. You're s-so... fit.                                   Orion: Oh, yeah?                                                                                    Luna: Mm-hm.                                                                                        Orion: Well, since we're sharing feelings here... Gotta say, every word I said before stands true.  You're kind, genuine, clever, and I love your humor. But, let me also add... you're also incredibly hot, Luna. Your body, your face, and your eyes – they're simply irresistible.                       Luna: T-Thank you... And oh, I forgot! I also like that I can touch you with my hands without       getting visions. It makes me feel more... connected to you.                                         Orion: You should take off those gloves, then. You can touch all you want.                          Luna: *Giggles* Okay...                                                                             Luna begins untying the laces of her gloves.                                                        Luna: *Breathing nervously* . . .                                                                   Orion: *Chuckles* So? You're scared to touch now?                                                   Luna: I'm not! I mean... With anyone else, I might be. But... not with you.                         Orion: Hmm, I don't know, you look pretty scared to me. You might have to convince me otherwise. Ah, I see... Is that all, though?                                                                      Luna's fingers trace a path up your chest, reaching toward the back of your head, where she cups    your neck with a gentle embrace.                                                                    Luna: *Twitching* MMmm-m-m-mmmmhh......                                                             Orion: L-Luna? You okay?                                                                            Luna: *Purring like a cat* Mmmmrr-mhhh-hmm. Y-Your skin is so warm.                                 Orion: Oh.                                                                                          Luna: It feels... good. T-Touching someone else, I mean. Will I ever get used to this feeling?      Orion: Through enough practice? I'm sure of it. But it'll never stop feeling good, don't worry.     Luna leaps back into your arms, initiating another passionate kiss. Her fingers eagerly weave       through your hair, tracing the lines of your neck with tender caresses.                             Orion: (Oh, man... I never thought I'd see Luna acting so passionately. And I fucking love it.)     Luna: *Putting her feet back onto the ground* MMmmmmmmhh...                                         Orion: (I love how she can't keep her hands on a single place. As if she wanted to map every inch of me. And the way she molds her body to mine, refusing to release her grip... God, she turns me on so much.)                                                                                             Luna: *Leaning forward* Mmmmmh...                                                                   Orion: (Oh shit, please don't–)                                                                     Luna: *Leaning back* Mmmmh?                                                                         Orion: Um... s-sorry, I... I got too excited.                                                       Luna: Is that...                                                                                    Orion: ...Yes. Sorry.                                                                               Luna: No, no, it's okay. I just... wasn't expecting it.                                             Orion: Yeah... (This is awkward.) Um... If you give me one minute...                                Luna: . . . Hmm.                                                                                    Orion: You okay?                                                                                    Luna lowers herself to her knees, moving with such deliberate slowness that it feels as if time     itself is moving in slow motion.                                                                    Orion: (W-What is going on...?) L-Luna?                                                             Luna: Do you want me to... Help you...?                                                             Orion: Wha... W-What did you just say?                                                              Luna: If you want to.                                                                               Orion: I... I mean... I-I would like to, yeah. (Jesus Christ, just seeing Luna in this position,    speaking like that... I can feel the blood rushing to my cock.) Are you sure, though?               Luna: Yeah. I want to do it. *Giggles playfully* I mean, I was about to do it anyway at my uncle's  place, right after your... massage. I would probably have done it already if my dad hadn't          interrupted. I guess I owe it to you.                                                               Orion: So you really wanted to do that right before you left the terrace! I thought it was all in my head.                                                                                              Luna: *Giggles* I suppose that now that I promised you to be completely transparent, I can't keep   secrets from you anymore.                                                                           Orion: Well, if I can be sincere too, I will admit that right now you're driving me wild down       there...                                                                                            Luna: Let me lend a hand, then. Let me... help you feel good. Like you helped me.                   Orion: *Reaching for your zipper* Oh man... Very well, then...                                      Luna: . . .                                                                                         Orion: Ahh, much better...                                                                          Luna: Wh... W-Wow.                                                                                  Orion: All good?                                                                                    Luna: I mean... y-yeah. I guess. I... I wasn't sure of what to expect, but... wow. H-How can you    keep all that inside your pants...? Aren’t you in swimming class?! How do you hide it in your       trunks?!                                                                                            Orion: Well... I'm usually not this... excited.                                                     Luna: Ah. Yeah. That... makes sense. . . . Can I... touch it?                                       Orion: Of course... I thought that was the whole point.                                             Luna: Ah... y-yeah... of course. Sorry, I'm a bit jittery.                                          Orion: No need to be, Luna. There's literally nothing you could do that would be wrong.             Luna: That's... reassuring.                                                                         Luna playfully trails her fingers along, mimicking tiny legs as they saunter up to your manhood.    Luna: Hmm...                                                                                        Orion: Now grab it...                                                                               Luna: *Twitching* M-M-Mmm-m-m-mmmhh . . . . . .                                                     Orion: O-Ohhh god... (I fucking love the way she twitches each time she touches me with her bare    hands...)                                                                                           Luna: *Pulling herself together* Mmmh...                                                            Orion: Y-You okay?                                                                                  Luna: Mm-hm...                                                                                      Luna draws near, so close that your dick nearly reaches her face, her touch moving in a teasingly   slow, deliberate motion.                                                                            Orion: O-Ohh my fucking god, yes...                                                                 Luna: It's so... warm... So hard... I can feel it... on my hand! *Giggles playfully* It's pulsing!  Orion: Y-Yeah... (Oh dear, she's so close... My cock is literally skimming her lips.)               Luna: I didn't know giving “massages” could be as fun as receiving them.                            Orion: R-Right?                                                                                     Luna: Yeah...                                                                                       Orion: Aahh... Y-You know, maybe... You should take those clothes off, Luna...?                     Luna: My... clothes? What for?                                                                      Orion: Well... Now I could probably come up with some silly excuse, but I value this newfound       honesty policy between us. The truth is, I just want to see you naked again so fucking badly.       Luna: *Giggles* Ah, I see...                                                                        Luna sidles away, her playful smirk lingering as she begins to unfasten her hunter corset.          Orion: (Fuck yes...)                                                                                She slips out of the leather corset, unveiling a tight black shirt that perfectly contours her      slender figure.                                                                                     Orion: That shirt looks good on you... although it doesn't seem very breathable.                    Luna: Yeah... it really isn't. It almost feels like a thermal t-shirt. Good for hunting demons, but perhaps not so much for... alternative activities. It was actually making me sweat a bit.           Orion: So I could actually have come up with an excuse after all. What a wasted opportunity.        Luna: *Snorts* Mm-hm.                                                                               Luna slips off her shirt, revealing, indeed, faint traces of sweat on her porcelain skin.           Orion: Jesus fucking Christ... Simply... wow. I had forgotten how perfectly shaped your tits were.  Luna: *Standing up* Oh, please.                                                                     Orion: I'm serious. I mean... just look at you! So... oof.                                          Luna: *Giggles* Stop giving me that smirk! *Giggles* It makes me jittery!                           Orion: I can't help it. Topless Luna Hernandez and the silly smirk on my face go together. It's a   reflex.                                                                                             Luna strides towards you with surprising confidence, pressing your dick against her belly.          Luna: *Lifting your face mask up* Hmm.                                                              Orion: *Chuckles* Ahh, fair enough.                                                                 Luna gracefully kneels down before you and starts jacking you off again.                            Orion: Ohhh yeah, babe... (Oh my god, her face is so close again... I wanna put my cock inside her  little cute mouth so bad... I need to. Should I try it? Or at least... ask? I mean, it's Luna we're talking about, I already can't believe she's doing what she's doing. Although... I bet she's        yearning for physical contact. She's been missing it all her life because of her condition.)        Luna: Am I doing it right...?                                                                       Orion: Fucking perfect. (Maybe...) Are you sure you don't wanna take off your pants too, though?    Luna: My pants? Is it because you're concerned about me sweating or because you want to see more of me...?                                                                                              Orion: Why not both?                                                                                Luna: Hah. Okay... I guess I can do that...                                                         Orion: Fuck yes... *Sitting on a nearby box* Please, don't mind me. I'm just getting a better seat  for the show.                                                                                       Luna: *Playfully giggles* You're so silly, you know that?                                           Orion: A silly, but happy man.                                                                      Luna: *Unfastening her belts* Ah, that usually goes together, you're right...                       Orion: (Oh wow, she's wearing a thong! And oh god, that body...) Please, come back here, Luna. I    need it. NOW.                                                                                       Luna: I haven't even fully taken off my pants yet!                                                  Orion: There's no need. It's sexier this way. You're not gonna leave me hanging now, are you?       Luna: *Giggles* You're lucky I'm so nice. The kindest soul some people have ever met, I hear...     Orion: *Chuckles* Lucky me indeed... (I adore seeing Luna at ease, playing along.)                  Luna elegantly walks towards you and crouches between your legs.                                    Orion: That's right... Aaahh, yeah, that's it... *Meticulously examining every inch of Luna's naked body* (Jesus, she's fucking breathtaking. And she's entirely for me and me alone...) Aaahh, yes...  Are you still having fun being on the giving side?                                                  Luna: Mm-hm. I feel so...                                                                           Orion: Horny?                                                                                       Luna: *Giggles* Y-Yes.                                                                              Orion: Are you enjoying the feeling of running your hands along my cock?                            Luna: I am... It... t-turns me on. Caressing your... big... t-thing.                                Orion: *Chuckles* (She's just as cute and innocent as she looks.)                                   Luna: I-I'm sorry, I never talked about sex with my family, s-so... saying gross stuff out loud     still feels a bit... embarrassing.                                                                  Orion: Don't worry, you can ask me whatever you want. We can explore whatever you want... together. Luna: I'd like that...                                                                              Let her continue                                                                                    Orion: (As much as I'd like to push her a little further, I can't ask her for much more. She's      already way out of her comfort zone.)                                                               Luna: *Slight moan* Mmmm...                                                                         Orion: (She's obviously so turned on, though. Maybe it's my turn to give something in return...)    Ask her for a blowjob                                                                               Orion: Agh... I can't bear the teasing anymore, Luna... Do you think you could... maybe... use your mouth?                                                                                              Luna moves her face even closer and starts giving you small kisses on the tip of your shaft.        Orion: O-o-oohhh, Jesus, now that level of teasing is just pure evil...                             Luna: There's no way I can fit your huge... c-cock inside my mouth, Orion. It’s too big for me, I   think...                                                                                            Orion: (She said “cock”!) Not even the tip? I'm sure you can do it...                               Luna: . . . It's too big...                                                                         Orion: (Maybe she needs a little more time...)                                                      Luna: *Slight moan* Mmmm...                                                                         Orion: Well, in that case...                                                                        You suddenly stand up and lift Luna off the floor.                                                  Luna: U-uh?                                                                                         Orion: You're horny as fuck, aren't you?                                                            Luna: . . . *Whispering* Yes...                                                                     Orion: Do you want me to take care of you too? We can have fun together.                            Luna: . . .                                                                                         Orion: You don’t have to be shy here... it’s just you and me. Just open up and say what's on your   mind, like we talked about before! There are no taboo topics with me, no bad questions.             Luna: I know...                                                                                     Orion: You want me to play with your pussy, don't you, naughty girl?                                Luna: . . .                                                                                         Orion: You want me to make you cum, like I did last time? Making you all breathless and dazed...?   Luna: . . . *Nods*                                                                                  Orion: Good girl...                                                                                 Luna: *Moans* AAAaaaahh...                                                                          You start caressing Luna's lips through her underwear's thin fabric, as she instinctively closes her legs.                                                                                              Orion: You're so wet...                                                                             Luna: AAahh...                                                                                      Orion: Do you want me to stop...?                                                                   Luna: N-NO...                                                                                       Orion: *Lifting Luna so fast her boots slip off* How about we make ourselves a bit more comfortable then?                                                                                               Luna: W-Wow, you're so strong. Um... more comfortable, y-yeah, sure. That sounds... good.           You remove Luna's trousers entirely and toss them across the room.                                  Orion: *Sitting down* Better, isn't it?                                                             Luna: Y-Your... I mean... Your... Y-Your thing is so close to my...                                 Orion: We've done this before.                                                                      Luna: Y-Yeah, but last time you weren't naked.                                                      Orion: Just relax.                                                                                  Luna: O-Okay. Relax. I can do that.                                                                 You gently move your hand towards Luna's already soaking wet pussy and slowly insert two fingers    inside of her.                                                                                      Luna: *Moaning* Ooooooohhh my god, Orion... T-That... felt... good...                               As you continue softly massaging Luna's insides, she gradually guides her right hand towards your   dick, brushing it with her fingertips.                                                              Luna: *Twitching* MMmm-m-m-m-mmmmhh......                                                           Orion: (Wow, even her vagina contracts when she twitches like that!)                                Luna: W-Whoa... K-Keep going, please...                                                             Orion: With pleasure...                                                                             Luna: AAAAaaaaahhhhh... O-Oh my GOD! *Moaning* I had f-forgotten... h-how amazing this feels...     Orion: (God, I love her so much.)                                                                   Luna: *Moans* AAaahh...                                                                             Orion: (There's something about Luna... I don't know if it's her always sweet, neutral tone of      voice, or her always gentle, reserved attitude. But seeing her letting out these loud moans... it   drives me absolutely wild.)                                                                         Luna: *Moans* Oh f-fuck, Orion...                                                                   Orion: Fuck?! That’s the second bad word out of your mouth tonight, Luna. Fuck?! An elegant lady    like you shouldn't use such foul language, Luna. Bad girl...                                        Luna: *Giggles* Aaa-ahaahh... y-yeah... *Moans* S-Sorry...                                          Orion: (I wonder if using her hands to touch me while being fingered also increases her pleasure.   Literally all she's experiencing now must feel like a new world to her.)                            Luna: AAaahhh... F-Faster...                                                                        Orion: Huh...?                                                                                      Luna: G-Go... faster...                                                                             Orion: Hah... You'll see now...                                                                     Luna: *Squeals* AAAAAAAaaahhh y-yeah! YEAH! *Moans* MMMmmmmMmmmhh... *Panting* Oh Dios mio, Orion...Orion: (OH FUCK YES, her voice can't be sexier when she speaks in Spanish...)                       Luna: *Moans* K-K-Keep this p-pace, p-please...                                                     Orion: I won't slow down one bit... (Jesus, she's so fucking tight. I can't help but imagine the    sensation of penetrating Luna. I imagine it has to be an experience bordering on the mystical...)   Luna: *Squeals* AAAAaaaaahhh... *Moans* D-Diosss...                                                 Orion: (Just seeing the way she squirms at the slightest touch... She's simply craving serious      physical closeness. And oh boy, I will be there to give her all the affection she needs...)         Luna: *Moans* Ooooooohhh my goddd.... *Moans* I t-think... *Moans* I-I think I'm g-gonna come...    *Moans* I can feel it coming... *Squeals* AAAAAaaaaahhHH!                                           Orion: (Man, she's so fucking hot...)                                                               Luna: *Moans intensely* AAAAaaaaaAAAaahhh...                                                        Orion: (I wanna make her scream. I wanna make her writhe in pleasure. I wanna make her cum over and over again...)                                                                                      Luna: Orion, I'm c-coming...!                                                                       Orion: Me too, Luna, I'm almost there...                                                            Luna: AAaahh... AAAAAAaAaaghh... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH... *Orgasming* MMMMMMmmMMMmmMmMmmmm.......!!! *Orgasming* MmmmmhhmmmmMMMmMmmm...... *Orgasming* MmmMMMMHHHhhmmMMMmMmmm......                     Orion: (W-Wow, that felt intense.)                                                                  Luna struggles to rise, managing to crawl for a few feet before succumbing to the floor in          exhaustion.                                                                                         Luna: *Panting* Wow... T-This was even more... vigorous than the first massage.                     Orion: And it will only get more intense from this point.                                           Luna: I'm not sure if I'd be able to stand it...                                                    Orion: Oh, I'm sure you would... *Sitting on the haystack* (Awh man, I was so close to finishing.   Just a few more seconds and I would–) H-Huh...? Luna...?                                            Luna: You didn't... finish.                                                                         Orion: Eh... no. I was about to, but–                                                               Luna suddenly straightens up and firmly grasps your member with both of her delicate hands. A fierce look of determination flashes across her face.                                                     Orion: O-Oh Lord... O-O-Ohhh god, Luna... Oh, f-fuck yes...                                         Luna: I want you to finish too... I want you to feel... as good as I did. I want you to teach me... how to give you pleasure.                                                                           Orion: Oh babe... You've got the perfect touch...                                                   Luna: I-It feels so... enormous between my hands.                                                   Orion: You're handling it just right...                                                             Luna: *Giggles* Thank you.                                                                          Orion: Aahhh... (I swear, I can't resist when she looks at me with this angelic expression of hers.)Luna: Like this...?                                                                                 Orion: Y-Yeah, keep doing what you're doing... *Looking at Luna's lips* (Man, this is becoming      unbearable... I-I know she said no, but–)                                                           Almost as if sensing your thoughts, Luna slouches down again and starts licking your shaft.         Orion: G-Goodness gracious...                                                                       Luna: *Whispering* This is what you wanted, right...?                                               Orion: FUCK YES... Please... Do it...                                                               Luna slides her lips over the tip of your dick. You can feel her throat gradually accommodating,    overcoming a few reflexes along the way.                                                            Orion: OOOOOOOhhhhh YES, f-finally...                                                               Luna: *Giggles* Hah... Turns out it could fit in after all...                                       Orion: Told you... Now put it back in...                                                            Luna: Mmmmm...                                                                                      Orion: YES... Use your hands too... O-O-OOOoooohhh Luna... Exactly like this, yeah...               Luna: *Moans* Mmmmm...                                                                              Orion: (At last... My cock is inside Luna's mouth... I can feel her warmth... Her tongue sliding    under my cock... And fuck me, it feels as good as I imagined...)                                    Luna: *Gagging* Mmmmm...                                                                            Orion: T-This feels unbelievable...                                                                 Luna: Mm-hmmm...                                                                                    As Luna finds her own rhythm, she grows increasingly confident with each passing moment, embracing  and savoring every second of the new experience.                                                    Orion: AAAAAahh... Good girl...                                                                     You sit back onto the haystack as Luna, undeterred, continues sucking you off, taking your dick even deeper into her tight throat.                                                                      Orion: F-FUUUUUCK... LUNA... Oh sweet Lord, y-you're a natural...                                   Luna: Mmmmm...                                                                                      Orion: (In the end it will be true what they say about innocent-looking girls... They end up being  the freakiest in bed...) AAAAaaah, fuck yes...                                                      Luna: *Pressing her hands tight against your body* MMMMmmmmmhh...                                   Orion: (I can sense it in the way she moans. I can see it written all over her face. Those innocent features, now twisted by desire... and corrupted by lust.) J-Jesus fucking Christ, Luna... You're   something else... I told you that you could do it, didn't I...?                                     Luna: MMmmmMm– *Stopping to recover her breath* AAAaAAAAHHh... *Panting* Y-Yes, yyyyou...           Orion: T-Take your time, get your breath back...                                                    Luna: *Recovering her breath* W-Wow... *Recovering her breath* Y-Yes... *Recovering her breath* Yes, y-you did say I could do it. *Recovering her breath* And I could! I got all of your... d-dick      inside my mouth.                                                                                    Orion: I-I'm sure you're capable of much more than you think...                                     Luna: *Recovering her breath* Hah... maybe you're right...                                          Orion: (Even as she struggled for breath, her gaze remained locked on my face. Her hands shuffled   back and forth between my cock and her own body. This is it, she can't get more uninhibited than she is right now. Every barrier she had was completely replaced by the rush of hormones and raw desire. Is it wrong that I feel proud about being the one who brought her to this state...?)               Luna: I'm ready... to continue...                                                                   Orion: Don't let me stop you...                                                                     Luna hungrily takes your dick inside her mouth again, enthusiastically continuing to suck it.       Orion: Fuck yes, that's it...                                                                       Luna: Mmmmm...                                                                                      Orion: AAaaaaah... Fuck, Luna, I'm gonna cum...                                                     Determined to give you as much pleasure as possible, Luna hastens her pace, surpassing your         expectations with a deliciously unanticipated speed.                                                Orion: O-O-Ooohhh my fucking god... F-Fuck, Luna, I'm g-gonna cum so much...                        Luna: *Gagging* MMMmmmM...                                                                          Orion: I'm almost there... don't stop now... K-Keep that pace...                                    Luna: *Gagging* MMMmmmmh...                                                                         Orion: Milk that cock, babe... Milk it till it's fucking dry...                                     Luna: *Gagging* MMMmmmMmmmmhhh......                                                                Orion: Look at me... That's it... Look at me while you choke on my cock...                          Luna: *Gagging* MMMmmmmh...                                                                         Cum on her                                                                                          Orion: Shit, I'm almost... I'm cumming! FFFFFFUUUUCKKK..... FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUCKKKKKKK.....       Luna: Wow.                                                                                          Orion: OOOooooooh, godddd... That was... glorious...                                                Luna: Geez, what a mess.                                                                            Orion: I'm sorry...                                                                                 Luna: I-It's okay. Nothing that can't be cleaned. I-I've got a cloth right there.                   Finish in her mouth                                                                                 Orion: Oh f-f-fuck... I'm cumming! *Kicking the floor* FFFFFFFFFUCKKKKKKK.....                      Luna: Mmmmgh...                                                                                     Orion: AAAAaaaaaaaaghhh....                                                                         Luna: MMmmmmmmhmhmhh......                                                                          Luna steps back with her mouth brimming with cum, not knowing exactly what to do next.              Orion: Ooooh, godddd... That was... glorious...                                                     Luna: . . . *Swallowing* Mmph. W-Wow. That was... m-more than expected.                             Orion: Yeah... sorry.                                                                               Luna: I-It's okay. Easier to... clean, I-I guess.                                                   Orion: (She didn't even flinch when swallowing... My little deviant... Who would have thought...    Man, now that she's using both of her hands, this feels like heaven... Only if she went fa–)        Almost as if sensing your thoughts, Luna hastens her pace, determined to give you as much           satisfaction as possible.                                                                           Orion: Ooooohhh, L-Luna...                                                                          Luna: Does it feel good...?                                                                         Orion: Fucking incredible... P-Please, don't stop.                                                  Luna: Okay...                                                                                       Orion: Looks like your magic touch is finally doing the trick on me...                              Luna: *Giggles* But this specific power is just for you...                                          Orion: F-Fuck yeah...                                                                               Luna spits on the tip of your cock and uses it to lube your member.                                 Orion: My little deviant... F-FUUUUUCK...                                                           Luna: Better?                                                                                       Orion: Much better...                                                                               Luna: *Whispering* Good...                                                                          Orion: (She's enjoying this. She WANTS this. I can sense it in the way she speaks. I can see it     written all over her face. Those innocent features, now twisted by desire... and corrupted by lust. Is it wrong that I feel proud about being the one who brought her to this state...?) AAAAaaaahhh... J-Jesus fucking Christ, Luna... You're something else...                                            Luna: Mm-hm...                                                                                      Orion: AAAaahhh... F-Fuck, I'm g-gonna cum so much... I'm almost there... don't stop now...         Luna: I won't...                                                                                    Orion: Milk that cock, babe... Milk it till it's fucking dry... *Sitting on the floor* My god,      Luna... You left me empty.                                                                          Luna: *Giggles* Did I...?                                                                           Orion: For real. I don't even know how you–                                                         Luna: *Gasps* Orion!                                                                                Orion: Hmm?                                                                                         Luna: The church!                                                                                   Orion: Yeah, I hear it. What about it?                                                              Luna: And the sun! It's morning!                                                                    Orion: Huh? *Standing up abruptly* Oh, SHIT, ALREADY?! How long have we been here?!                 Luna: I'm not sure... maybe for an hour? Maybe more?                                                Orion: Damn, Penny must think we're dead! We need to find her!                                      Luna: Yeah! I didn’t realize, we should get going. Penny’s clever and resourceful, so I’m not too   worried... but still, there’s no telling what those hunters could get up to. At the very least,     she’ll be worried about us.                                                                         Orion: Yeah, definitely. Let's find her and get out of this damn town once and for all!             Luna: Y-Yeah!                                                                                       Orion: *Looking at how Luna is trying to covering herself* (It's adorable seeing her shyness return after everything we just did. That look of hers... she's so fucking cute. But damn, she sure gears  up when she wants to. Dammit... she's starting to get me all riled up again...)                     Luna: Shouldn't we... get dressed?                                                                  Orion: *Clears throat* Ah, y-yes! S-Sorry, I was just thinking through the plan! T-The town! Let's  leave it! ONCE AND FOR ALL! Okay... I remember passing through these small ruins when we arrived.   Luna: Yeah, me too. If I'm not mistaken, the Exit Portal and the river should be just within a      hundred yards.                                                                                      Orion: Dammit, Penny's still nowhere to be found.                                                   You dedicate several hours to searching for Penelope, but with no success. Eventually, the sun rises and you find yourself back at a small set of ruins you saw when you first arrived.                 Orion: (Fuck... she’s nowhere to be found. Where the hell are you, Penny?) *Sighs* (At least I saw  the hunters searching for both Penny and Luna during the whole night. I guess that's a good sign. It means they didn't find them either. Or so I hope.)                                                 Luna: Orion?                                                                                        You dedicate several hours to searching for Luna, but with no success. Eventually the sun rises and you find yourself back at a small set of ruins you saw when you first arrived.                      Orion: (Fuck... she wasn't by the church or the windmill. Maybe I should have tried looking         somewhere else...? She didn't mention any other meeting spot, right...? AGHHH, I should have paid   more attention! And now I'm nearly back at the Exit Portal, and there's still no sign of anyone     here! What if something happened to them? Shit, did I really fail them?! Did I let them die?!! DID  I–)                                                                                                 Luna: Hey Orion.                                                                                    Orion: *Turning around* Huh? LUNA! So good to see you!                                              Luna: What are you still doing here? I thought you were supposed to find Penny and leave the server.Orion: That's the problem – I couldn't find her! I've been looking for her for hours, but she's     M.I.A.! *Sighs* But at least you’re safe! Definitely a sight for sore eyes! Thank god, are you      okay?! I was so worried!                                                                            Luna: Yeah, I'm alright. No worries.                                                                Orion: Oof, thank god. Where have you been?                                                         Luna: I've been hiding in the old barn, waiting for the sun to come up so I could avoid the hunter  patrols.                                                                                            Orion: The old barn! I knew it! W-Well, I didn't, but I wish I had known. But anyway, I'm glad to   see you're safe.                                                                                    Luna: Yeah.                                                                                         Orion: (Hmm... Her smile seems a bit off today.) Did anything happen while you waited in that barn? You know you can tell me anything. You sure everything's cool, though? You know you can tell me     anything. If something happened...                                                                  Luna: I know! But everything is okay, I swear! I'm just tired, that's all.                          Orion: (Well, that actually makes sense.) Alright... okay then! I'll take your word for it.         (Sometimes it's hard to know what's inside Luna's mind.) *Sighs* Now we're just missing Penny. Do   you think we should–                                                                                Penelope: GUUUUUUYYSSS!!!                                                                           Luna: Penny!                                                                                        Orion: W-Whoa! Speaking of the devil! It's so good to see you!                                      Penelope: Oh my god, I was so worried! I thought something terrible had happened to you!            Orion: We were the worried ones! Have you been here the whole time?                                 Penelope: *Dismounting you* Not at all! So much has happened that I couldn't possibly cover it all! Luna: Tell us the short version, then!                                                              Penelope: Short version...? OKAY! Yeah, short version! *Takes a deep breath*                        OkayrememberwhenwesplitintownandIwenttofindthosevampiresright?!                                     Orion: W-What? Breathe and don't speak so fast!                                                     Penelope: Mm-hm! O-Okay. So, as I was saying, I went to find those vampires, and... THEN I stumble  upon this old cemetery, creepy monsters everywhere, when suddenly whoop, there's Orion! We meet Lord Iliescu, nice talk, good people, zip back to Hollowbrook, but wait! Orion hears someone tailing us, so we split again! THEN I stumble upon this old cemetery, dark, scary, creepy monsters everywhere, yes? But WAIT because in the same place I also meet Lord Iliescu, his wife, and this cool butler    Mortimer – good folks! Lysandra sniffs my tits, they're like, “yo, want some drink?” Not blood, just wine! Had a chat, said bye-bye, zoomed back to Hollowbrook! Then I get there, and I'm hearing these peeps talking about killing innocent centaurs, and I'm thinking, “man, these guys are nuts!” So I  start looking for you, I can't find you anywhere, then, whoosh! I spy four dudes heading into the   forest. I tail them, and I catch them trying to ambush a centaur family, with babies and everything! I'm like, “HEY!” – I shout it out loud. Centaurs hear me, hunters show themselves, chaos breaks    out, hunters die, and the centaurs are all, “wow, thank you, come meet the king!” and I'm like      “well, okay I guess.” So, I tag along, and bam, meet the king, everyone's chilling, and then he's   like “so, do you wanna be my queen?” and I'm like “whaaaaaat?” And he's like “we can breed some     half-human, half-horse lineage!” and I'm thinking, “but aren't centaurs already half-human,         half-horse...?”                                                                                     Orion: W-What?                                                                                      Penelope: So anyway, that question distracts them and causes a huge debate, so I use it to sneak    out, and I head back to town! Then I find this injured woman, I use restoration magic to patch her  up, then bam! Her husband shows up, and I'm like, “ OH FUCK!” But surprise, he's actually super     grateful! They say father Bakhar is crazy, they help me find a way out of town, and point me to this keep. I get here, no one's around. I wait ten minutes, meet a funny squirrel and a mushroom that I could swear moved, 5 more minutes, and... BOOM! I finally find you both!                            Orion: W-Wow. And did all of this happen... today?                                                  Penelope: Mm-hm.                                                                                    Orion: H-Holy shit. *Laughs* Going on an adventure with you sure guarantees a wild ride.            Luna: The important thing is that you're safe and sound!                                            Penelope: Awww, thank you Luny! Your sweet voice always takes all of my stress away.                Orion: (Even if Penny doesn't realize it, she's had that same effect on Luna. She looks a lot       happier since she showed up.)                                                                       Penelope: But anyway, enough talking about myself! Tell me, how was your ride?                      Luna: W-What ride? I didn't r-ride anything. I just... We, uh, just...                              Orion: ...we just hid in one of the town's buildings. There were a lot of hunters patrolling the    streets, so we stayed put until dawn.                                                               Luna: Y-Yeah! Exactly. It wasn't safe to venture out with them around. We don't really have a cool  story to tell like you. I just hid in one of the town's buildings and stayed put until dawn to avoid the hunters patrolling.                                                                            Orion: Yeah, we regrouped here just a minute before you showed up.                                  Penelope: Well, I agree, the important thing is that you're safe and sound!                         Father Bakhar: I wouldn't be so sure about that...                                                  As you slowly turn around, you find the leader of the hunters, Father Bakhar, pointing a gun at you.Orion: (Oh, man, not this guy again...) Um... look, we were about to leave. If you let us go our    way, we won't get in yours.                                                                         Father Bakhar: Hmm. *Stopping to point at you* Of course, of course. Don't worry, we came here in   peace... No need to get so defensive.                                                               Orion: And what's up with your “I wouldn't be so sure about that”, then?                            Father Bakhar: I simply mean that these woods hold danger, that's all. We've got to protect our     friends from the demons.                                                                            Orion: Of course...                                                                                 Father Bakhar: But I'm glad I bumped into you. I wanted to thank you personally.                    Orion: Thank me? For what?                                                                          Father Bakhar: Well, today's hunt was a huge success thanks to you.                                 Orion: Thanks to me...?                                                                             Father Bakhar: Show them our trophy, Geoffrey.                                                      One of the hunters that came with Father Bakhar steps closer, clutching a blood-stained bag.        Father Bakhar: Open it.                                                                             The hunter starts untying the bag, and something tumbles out.                                       Orion: Oh– OH, F-FUCK! I-Is that... L-Lord Iliescu?                                                 Penelope: Oh god, I think I'm gonna puke. That's disgusting.                                        Father Bakhar: I don't know. I never bothered to learn its name. He was the leader of the vampires, that's what matters. He ventured to our town, apparently because you told him we had a healer       capable of curing his wife, or so he said.                                                          One of the hunters that came with Father Bakhar steps closer, clutching a blood-stained bag.        Father Bakhar: Open it.                                                                             The hunter starts untying the bag, and something tumbles out.                                       Orion: Oh– OH, F-FUCK! I-Is that... F-Fangrend?                                                     Luna: Ugh, I can't even look at it. It's just so dreadful.                                          Father Bakhar: I don't know. I never bothered to learn its name. He was the leader of the           werewolves, that's what matters. He ventured to our town, apparently because you told him we had a  shaman capable of curing their curse, or something. That was a clever ruse. It was easy to drug him and decapitate him when he lay unconscious.                                                         Orion: Really...? Was this truly necessary?                                                         Father Bakhar: Don't play the saint now. Someone has to get their hands dirty. And if no one else   has the nerve, I will.                                                                              Orion: *Sighs* I guess.                                                                             Father Bakhar: Anyway, we've got to head back to town. The other monsters could initiate a revenge  attack any time now. If you ever need help, you can reach out to us. Hollowbrook won't leave a      fellow demon hunter hanging.                                                                        Orion: I'll... keep that in mind. Goodbye.                                                          Father Bakhar: HUNTERS! We're leaving!                                                              Your newfound allies disappear into the woods as they make their way back to Hollowbrook.           Orion: (Fuck, this is not how I expected the day to end. But, on the bright side, we've got some new powerful allies, I guess. Though their methods are somewhat... questionable. And I don’t know how  welcome they’ll be on other servers. But... well, if we're really supposed to liberate all the NPCs from Ulysses, this is definitely a huge first step.) *Turning towards Penelope* Well, that was a    pretty rough ending to this short tale, I'll admit.                                                 Penelope: That was so disgusting. Is... is Lord Iliescu's head still there...?                      Orion: Um... yes.                                                                                   Penelope: Jesus... they're way worse than the “monsters” they claim to pursue.                      Orion: Yeah, I have to agree.                                                                       Penelope: Lord Iliescu didn't deserve this.                                                         Orion: No, he didn't. *Sighs* But I guess this is something we'll have to deal with if we really    want to “free” all the NPCs from Ulysses. With free will comes human nature. And human nature can   be... something scary.                                                                              Penelope: Yeah... that's an understatement.                                                         Orion: *Turning towards Luna* Well, that was a pretty rough ending to this short tale, I'll admit.  Luna: That was so disgusting. I can't even imagine how Duke and Burpee will feel when they find out about this. Should we try to warn them?                                                             Orion: They're certainly quirky, but they're not stupid. They'll spot those hunters from a mile     away. They might even have bolted by now, for all we know. Plus... I don’t know how trustworthy     they’ll find other humans after this.                                                               Luna: I hope you're right about them escaping... These hunters are far worse than the m-monsters    they claim to chase.                                                                                Orion: Yeah, I can't argue with that.                                                               Luna: Fangrend didn't deserve this.                                                                 Orion: No, he really didn't. *Sighs* But I guess this is something we'll have to deal with if we    really want to “free” all the NPCs from Ulysses. With free will comes human nature. And human nature can be... something scary.                                                                         Luna: Yeah... I guess you're right.                                                                 Orion: I don't know about you, but I can't wait to get the fuck out of this server.                 Luna: Please... This last encounter left a bad taste in my mouth.                                   Penelope: Yeah, I wish I could just erase it from my memory.                                        Orion: I know it's a lot to ask, but try not to dwell on it. Empty your mind!                       Penelope: Some of us sure have less to empty.                                                       Luna: *Chuckles*                                                                                    Orion: *Laughs* Okay, I'll take one for the team. Um... look, we were about to leave, so...         Father Bakhar: You thought you were so clever, didn't you?                                          Orion: Yeah, yeah, you caught us. We're magic users, and no, we're not actually hunters. But hey,   we're outta here for good now, so if you don't mind...                                              Father Bakhar: No, that's not gonna happen.                                                         Orion: I'm sorry?                                                                                   Father Bakhar: Your existence ends here. I will kill you and fulfill my duty to purge the world of  the devil's spawn.                                                                                  Orion: *Sighs* Don't try it, man. I really don't wanna hurt you.                                    Father Bakhar: *Chuckles* Do you know what I hold in my hand, demon?                                Orion: I know what a gun is, yes. I'm more surprised you know about it. I thought you were still    stuck on slingshots and pitchforks.                                                                 Father Bakhar: Not just any gun... a dimeritium one.                                                Orion: Dimeritium...? (Wasn't that the stuff in the shackle around Calypso's neck?)                 Father Bakhar: From your face, I'm guessing you know what it does. It doesn't matter what magic     tricks you've got. Teleporting, pyrokinesis, turning into who-knows-what. As soon as I pull the     trigger, all magic in a 10-feet bubble gets zapped. You and your friends will die like the dogs you are. And I? I will be rewarded for having faith, beyond measure...                                  Orion: (That dimeritium stuff shouldn't affect me, right...? But... what if it does? If it blocked  Calypso's magic, why wouldn't it shut down my powers too? Fuck...) What do you want? If you didn't  want anything from us, you would have killed us already.                                            Father Bakhar: Ah, smart. The vampires. I know you've met them. The werewolves. I know you've met   them. I want to know where they're hiding, and how many of them are there. Tell me... and I'll let  you live.                                                                                           Orion: Hmm. (Shit, I can't betray them like that. Not after how nice they were to us.) *Gesturing to the girls to back off* Yeah, no.                                                                   Father Bakhar: Excuse me...?                                                                        Orion: Fuck you. I won't tell you shit about them. Ask something else.                              Father Bakhar: *Breathing heavily* Something... else...? D-Do you really believe you're in any      position to negotiate, you insolent fool?!                                                          Orion: You would have pulled the trigger regardless.                                                Father Bakhar: *Laughs maniacally* Hahaha... you know what... YOU'RE FUCKING RIGHT I WOULD! I AM BUT THE INSTRUMENT OF THE LORD... TASKED WITH ERADICATING EVIL FROM THIS WORLD! NOW EMBRACE YOUR       DEMISE, YOU DEMONS! AND DIEEEEEEEEE!!!!!! . . . Huh...? What...?                                    Burpee: *Wheeze laugh* HAHAHAHA I can't believe that actually worked!                               Duke: *Laughs* T-The motherfucker really tried to shoot with the violin!                            Burpee: *Wheeze laugh* What a jackass!                                                              Luna: Hi guys!                                                                                      Burpee: HI LUNA!!!                                                                                  Duke: YOU SMELL AS GOOD AS EVER!!                                                                   Orion: D-Do you know them?                                                                          Luna: I do! They're the guys I met at the werewolves' hideout.                                      Father Bakhar: W-What... what are these things? How did you do that?! Are my eyes... bewitched?     Lord Iliescu: Fear not, Father. The only magic involved here is the unnatural speed of my kin.      Penelope: Lord Iliescu!                                                                             Lord Iliescu: Ah, Lady Penelope... Your radiance shines even brighter in the light of day.          Penelope: Aw, thank you!                                                                            Orion: D-Do you know him?                                                                           Penelope: I do! He's the Lord of the Vampire clan I met at that cemetery!                           Father Bakhar: No, no... this is impossible...                                                      Lord Iliescu: Not impossible at all. You perceived my people as mere animals to be hunted, but the  reality is they can possess discipline when... properly guided. They're capable of moving swiftly... even beyond the perception of human sight. Of course, it helped that you were so oblivious that you didn't even notice how we swapped your firearm for one of our instruments.                         Vampire: *Sniffing the gun* Hmmmgg...                                                               Mortimer: *Kicking the creature* Can't you see you're getting burned in the sunlight, you dolt?!    Stay in the shadows!                                                                                Father Bakhar: No... No... no... NO... What is this absurd circus...? I refuse to be ridiculed by   these infernal creatures... I WILL NOT TOLERATE IT! I WILL KILL YOU ALL! DO YOU HEAR ME?! I WILL    EVISCERATE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF Y–                                                                   Fangrend: *Picking Father Bakhar up from the ground* Welp, everything seems to have turned out      rather well after all, wouldn't you agree?                                                          Orion: Fangrend! What are you doing here?! Uh... I-I suppose so, yeah. But... who are you?          Fangrend: *Laughs* I suppose it's normal you don't recognize me. I'm Fangrend. We had a brief chat  in our hideout earlier, when I was a little more... animalized.                                     Orion: Oh, right! I knew your voice was familiar!                                                   Fangrend: You see... after our encounter, I pondered for a while with the pack until I finally      decided to take action. I guess you could say you inspired me. I was making my way towards          Hollowbrook, evading the hunter patrols, when I crossed paths with Lazarus.                         Lord Iliescu: A pleasure to meet you, Orion.  Lazarus Iliescu, sovereign of Stravenovia, at your    service.                                                                                            Orion: The pleasure is mine.                                                                        Lord Iliescu: Penelope mentioned you several times during our brief meeting in our catacombs. Looks like her description was... deeply accurate.                                                        Orion: Is that so? (Huh, I wonder what she said...) Uh... I-I suppose so, yeah. But... who are you? Fangrend: My name is Fangrend, proud leader of a pack of valiant werewolves hailing from the western regions of Ekabar.                                                                                 Orion: Ohh... Pleasure to meet you, I'm Orion.                                                      Fangrend: I had a feeling. Luna spoke of you often during her time with us. Seems her portrayal of  you was... remarkably accurate.                                                                     Orion: Is that so? (Huh, I wonder what she said...) And what are you two doing here?                Lord Iliescu: After our encounter, Mortimer and I deliberated for some time before deciding to take action. I was making my way towards Hollowbrook, evading the hunter patrols, when I crossed paths   with Lord Fangrend.                                                                                 Fangrend: The thing is that, after some talking, we came to the conclusion that our motivations     aren’t as disparate as we once believed. So we set aside the age-old rivalry between our clans, and decided to collaborate towards a common goal. The first step was to dismantle Father Bakhar's       influence, halting his corruption of Hollowbrook's citizens.                                        Orion: I see... Good. He had to be stopped. What are you gonna do with him now?                     Fangrend: I'll take him to our sanctuary. Some time amongst our community might encourage a...      reconsideration of his principles.                                                                  Lord Iliescu: However, that's a concern for another time. I heard you were preparing to leave, I    wouldn't wish to detain you or Lady Penelope any longer.                                            Orion: Thank you very much. Can I make one final request, though? Whenever he wakes up... could you ask him where he got that Dimeritium gun? I'm interested.                                           Fangrend: Of course, we'll check on that for you.                                                   Lord Iliescu: We'll gladly share any findings with you the next time we cross paths.                Fangrend: And if you ever need assistance in these lands, don't hesitate to reach out. You've got   allies in Ekabar.                                                                                   Orion: The feeling is mutual. You can count on us.                                                  Fangrend: Alright, boys, we're done here! Duke, Burpee, back into the fold!                         Burpee: Yes, sire!                                                                                  Duke: Bye, Luna!                                                                                    Lord Iliescu: Indeed, it's time for us to depart as well. Let's return to Lysandra, Mortimer.       Mortimer: Yes, sir. Farewell, Lady Penelope.                                                        Your newfound allies disappear into the woods as they make their way back to Hollowbrook, taking    Father Bakhar along with them.                                                                      Orion: (We've gotta swing by again, no doubt about it. Both of them look like solid allies, at least in this server. And if we are really supposed to “free” all the NPCs from Ulysses, this is         definitely a huge first step.) *Turning towards Luna and Penelope* Well, that was a pretty happy    ending to this short tale, huh?                                                                     Penelope: Definitely! We have to come back, no question! I've gotta introduce Luna to Lysandra      someday.                                                                                            Luna: And you have to meet Duke and Burpee, you'll love them!                                       Orion: But let's leave that for another day! I seriously NEED to go back to the real world now.     PLEASE.                                                                                             Penelope: *Chuckles* Yes, yes! Let's leave before we stumble into some random war between dwarves   and talking mushrooms or something.                                                                 Luna: Or before you bump into those centaurs again.                                                 Penelope: *Laughs* Oh god, that'd be even worse.                                                    Orion: Are you absolutely certain about declining their offer to become their queen, Penny? Imagine the advantages, a race of half-human, half-horsies at your beck and call.                           Penelope: *Laughs* Shut up!                                                                         Orion: *Removing your E-Visor* (And back to the real world... Feeling exhausted, as usual. What time is it, even?) *Looking at your phone* (Ugh, nearly 5AM. I'm supposed to wake up for school in 3    hours. Ugh. Makes me wonder, though... nights in Ekabar are slightly shorter than on Earth. Curious. Well, I guess Eternum is still Earth. Just a different... plane? Dimension? Or maybe not...? What  if there's another planet somewhere in the vast Universe where we're teleported through the neural  implant...? Or where our astral projections are...) *Yawns* (O-Okay, enough of my crazy internal    monologues for now.) *Hugging your pillow* (Time for sleep.)                                        Your phone buzzes.                                                                                  Orion: Hmm? (Oh, it's Luna.) *Chuckles* (God, she's adorable. I just wanna hold her close and never let go.) *Relieved sigh* (I needed this little chat, things ended a bit abruptly in Hollowbrook. I  really love how cute and innocent she is, but damn, she really opened up to me earlier. Man, Luna   really opened up to me earlier. In every sense... Can't wait to spend more time with her.) *Getting comfy* (But now... seriously, it's time to sleep. Three hours of rest are better than none.) *Yawns* (I'm sure I'll wake up... as fresh as... A head of... lettuce...) W-W-Whaat...? Where am I? What   time is it?!                                                                                        Nancy: *From downstairs* Come on, everyone, wake up! You're gonna be late!                          Orion: (Oh fuck me, have three hours passed already?! I just closed my eyes...)                     Penelope: Move, move, move! I have a photoshoot today and my hair needs to be flawless!             Orion: (Oh right, it's photoshoot day! Oh right, Penelope's going to her photoshoot today. I wish I could have joined her...)                                                                           Dalia: Fuck off, it's my turn to shower!                                                            Penelope: You haven't showered yet?! Then why... OH SHIT, what’s that behind you??                  Dalia: *Turning around* Huh? Where?                                                                 Penelope: *Closing the bathroom door* Sorry! It's urgent!                                           Dalia: Goddammit, Penny, open up!                                                                   Orion: *Chuckles* (At least it looks like the little sleep didn't affect Penny's energy. Alright    then, let's finish the week. LET'S GO!) *Taking a deep breath* Mmmmmhhh... (Finally, the last class of the day. Boy, what a marathon of a week.)                                                        Professor Keating: Alright everyone, that wraps it up for today... Have a nice weekend!             Orion: Hmm?                                                                                         You look at Luna as she neatly tucks away her things into her bag.                                  Orion: You got any plans for the weekend, Luna?                                                     Luna: I do! I do, actually. Tomorrow I'm gonna be playing with Alex while you're in the pirate      server. And today I'm helping my dad at the cafe.                                                   Orion: Ah, I see! I'm meeting with Penny in a few minutes.                                          Luna: I know! I'd wait for her with you, but I have to run. The regular barista at Loco's on Fridays couldn't make it, so I've got to fill in. Sorry for leaving in such a rush. Yeah, I know. I'd like to see her too, but I have to run. The regular barista at Loco's on Fridays couldn't make it, so    I've got to fill in.                                                                                Orion: You're even busier than Penny!                                                               Luna: Yeah, sorry for leaving in such a rush.                                                       Orion: Oh, no worries! Give your dad a “hey” from me!                                               Luna: I will! See you later, Orion! Sure. See you.                                                  Orion: Bye! (It's pretty sweet how, even amidst all the chaos in our lives, we still find time for  the little things and kick it together. Hmm, I wonder what the gang at school would say if they knew me and Luna, Dalia, Annie, or Alex are a little more than just “pals”. Hmm, I wonder what the gang at school would say if they knew me and Luna, Dalia, or Annie are a little more than just “pals”.

Hmm, I wonder what the gang at school would say if they knew me and Dalia, Annie, or Alex are a little more than just “pals”. Very sweet. I    mean, isn't this what makes us human after all? Sometimes I wonder what– I mean... I’ve caught their looks. Some would totally be jealous, heh. And not only that... I’m about to meet Penelope to tag  along to one of her photoshoots! Bet some of these dudes drool over her Insta pics... Bet some of   these dudes drool over their Insta profiles... Boy, life is good!) . . . *Spinning your pen*        (Although... This makes me wonder... would the girls be mad if they found out I'm fooling around    with the others? I’ve never thought about it... maybe I should start. I mean... I'm not “officially” dating anyone, and no one's popped the exclusive question, so... I'm not doing anything wrong, am  I...? I really don't want to hurt anyone. But nah, they shouldn't be too upset, I think. Like, I    wouldn't be upset if they wanted to explore something between themselves. On the contrary, that     might even be kinda hot. Although... would I get jealous if I caught one of them flirting with some other dude? Hell yes, I would. I'd even be annoyed if they were flirting with another girl outside  our “circle”. Does that make me a hypocrite...? Probably... But truth is... fuck, I can't change how I feel. And I just can't help but love them all. Like them all.) . . . (Did I say “love”? Hmm. I   mean, I love them, but do I love them? Shit, is this... love? Am I in LOVE with them? With ALL of   them?) . . . (Have I ever actually been in love before...? Like, what even is love anyway, am I     right? I mean... what is “love” but a consumerist, societal construct that–) U-U-Uhh??! M-Mr.       Keating!                                                                                            Professor Keating: Didn't you hear me?! Class is dismissed!                                         Orion: Oh! Yes! S-Sorry, Mr. Keating, I was, uh...                                                  Professor Keating: Lost in thought again, right?                                                    Orion: N-No, Professor!                                                                             Professor Keating: Come on, Orion! We both know better. Your mind's often elsewhere, caught up in   your own world!                                                                                     Orion: N-No, Professor! I-I mean... well, yeah, sometimes, but I'm working on improving that!       Professor Keating: I bet you didn't even pay attention in class.                                    Orion: No, I did! Fascinating class, Professor!                                                     Professor Keating: Oh, really? Then I'm sure you won't have any issues if I ask you a couple of     questions?                                                                                          Orion: Not at all, Professor.                                                                       Professor Keating: What are the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?               Orion: Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus and organelles; eukaryotic cells have both.                 Professor Keating: What are the stages of mitosis?                                                  Orion: Prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.                                                Professor Keating: What is the function of the Krebs cycle?                                         Orion: Generating high-energy molecules and ATP through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA derived from    carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.                                                                  Professor Keating: . . .                                                                            Orion: . . .                                                                                        Professor Keating: . . . You think you're so clever, don't you?                                     Orion: N-Not really, Professor. I just have a good memory and knack for certain things. Other areas? Total mess.

Professor Keating: Did you do something different with your hair?                                   Orion: Uh... it's a bit longer now.                                                                 Professor Keating: Hmm. It suits you. Takes me back to my younger days.                             Orion: T-Thank you, Professor.                                                                      Professor Keating: I used to have a magnificent mane, you know?                                     Orion: I-I'm sure of it, Professor.                                                                 Professor Keating: . . .                                                                            Orion: . . .                                                                                        Professor Keating: . . . Alright, you're free to go! Go home and study! I expect top marks on next  week's test!                                                                                        Orion: Yes, Mr. Keating! (Phew, finally. For a second, I thought he was going to threaten me with   expulsion again. Although... I have to admit that, despite his constant scolding, I genuinely       appreciate Mr. Keating. I know he means well. And to be honest, he's right, sometimes I stay in my  own world for too long. Alright, no more overthinking! From now on, it's all about living in the    present! Send me distractions, Universe!)                                                           Chang: *Drifting through the hallway* MY MAN!                                                       Orion: (Damn, that was fast.) HEY CH–                                                               Chang: *Hyperventilating* Y-YES! I knew it was you! I'd recognize those broad, masculine, thick,    solid, tight shoulders from a mile away!                                                            Orion: *Chuckles* Thanks, bro.                                                                      Chang: Those muscular, powerful thighs and th–                                                      Orion: D-Don't beat around the bush! What's the matter?                                             Chang: S-Sorry, I'm nervous. I was about to ask Micaela out on a date. Like, an official date. Not  as friends. I want to ask her to be my girlfriend.                                                  Orion: Oh man, that's great!                                                                        Chang: I was supposed to meet her to go back home together, and when I was about to ask her... I-I  panicked and dashed here to find you instead.                                                       Orion: You mean like... right now? A-And you left her there hanging?                                Chang: I told her I had a sudden bathroom emergency.                                                Orion: Oh... okay, that might even work.                                                            Chang: I need your advice, man. I need you to guide me. You're my pillar, the rock I lean on.       Please!                                                                                             Go for it                                                                                           Orion: You're at the threshold, Chang. You really like this girl. And it seems like she feels the   same about you. You've been laying the groundwork for this moment over the past few weeks. All the  little moments you've shared together. The birthday gift. The day you invited her to the movies.    Your unwavering support during the gym competition. Even the self-confidence you've built making    those awesome shirts for all of us. IT'S ALL LED YOU TO THIS MOMENT! So you're going to head back to her, ask her out on an incredibly romantic date, and begin a beautiful love story with the woman of your dreams.                                                                                       Chang: Yes. YES! I'm doing it! Right now! And she's going to say yes!                               Orion: Hell yeah! Just be confident, and everything will be just fine. Good luck, buddy.            Chang: Thanks, man.                                                                                 Orion: Anytime!                                                                                     Don't ask her on a date yet                                                                         Orion: Um... I think this might not be the best time, Chang. You're clearly too nervous at the      moment. I know you really like this girl, and it seems like she feels the same way about you, but   asking her out right now might lead to regrets. You should wait for a moment when you feel more     confident.                                                                                          Chang: Yes... Yes, that makes sense. I should wait for the right moment! Rushing this might make me regret it forever. She's special, you know?                                                         Orion: Exactly!                                                                                     Chang: I feel a lot more relaxed now. Thank you.                                                    Orion: Anytime, man.                                                                                Chang: You're really good at lifting others up. You're a born leader! No wonder you've got so many  beautiful girls going crazy about you.                                                              Orion: *Chuckles* If you say so.                                                                    Chang: Okay, I'm heading back to Micaela! I feel a lot more confident now. Thanks again, brother!   And sorry I came to bother you.                                                                     Orion: Don't even mention it. And no worries, you'll never be a bother. Tell me all about it next   time!                                                                                               Chang: Will do!                                                                                     Orion: See you Monday?                                                                              Chang: Sure thing! Good luck finding those Gems of yours!                                           Orion: Thanks! (Man, I genuinely hope that relationship goes well. I'd really hate to see Chang     heartbroken. But anyway, speaking of dates... I should start heading to the meeting spot with Penny too. A professional agent shouldn't keep his client waiting. That's not how I handle business...    Let's roll!) *Sighs* (Well, time to head home. Everyone's busy today, so I'll guess I'll just play  some video games. As much as I love Eternum, sometimes it feels good to just lay back on the bed    with a controller and simply relax... So alright... let's roll! Whoa, what fantastic weather we have today. Kredon really looks beautiful when it's not raining. I had never been to this area. Lots of office buildings and banks. There's definitely more wealth in this town than meets the eye. If we   can even continue calling it a “town”. With how it’s grown during the past few years, it’s basically a city. I can't help but wonder if Ulysses has influenced it all...)                               Penelope: Oh my, what a gorgeous fella! Are you here to model in the photoshoot too?                Orion: *Laughs* I'm here for the shoot, but not to steal any modeling thunder. I didn't make the    cut, I'm afraid. You should see the beauties that work in this industry. *Checking Penny out* Then  again... damn, girl, you'd probably outshine them all effortlessly. Face, body, that pose... you've got the whole package. Would you consider working with me? I promise to elevate your career to new  heights.                                                                                            Penelope: *Laughs* I don't know... I'm hesitant. There are some pretty scandalous tales about agents in the modeling world, you know? I've heard stories about them all being opportunistic perverts.   Orion: Not me, I can assure you of that. If anything were to develop between us beyond a strictly   professional connection, it would purely stem from our natural chemistry and mutual sexual          attraction. No shady, hidden agendas for me!                                                        Penelope: *Chuckles* Oh wow, what a professional. In that case... deal. I accept your offer. You can come with me to the photoshoot.                                                                    Orion: *Chuckles* Sounds great. (I love these flirty exchanges with Penny. She is such a tease...)  Jokes aside though, I really mean it. You look incredible, Penny.                                   Penelope: *Chuckles* Thanks!                                                                        Orion: I'm guessing this is what you'll wear during the photoshoot?                                 Penelope: Oh, not really, I'll change once we're there. Today, I have to pose with a fancy car and  model some famous designer’s dress.                                                                 Orion: So this is just your day-to-day outfit?                                                      Penelope: Yeah, it's what I wore at college.                                                        Orion: Ohh, I see. Well, let me say, I absolutely love that top.                                    Penelope: Do you? Thank you! It's just something I saw at a local street market – I just couldn't   resist it! I love how it looks with high-waisted jeans or a skirt. It highlights my waist, but      without showing too much, you know?                                                                 Orion: You've got a good eye! (God, the way her boobs jiggled when she turned around... Is she not  wearing a bra...?)                                                                                  Penelope: Hmph.                                                                                     Orion: *Chuckles* What?                                                                             Penelope: I've come to recognize that horndog expression by now, Orion. What filthy thoughts are    dancing through that mind of yours this time?                                                       Orion: *Chuckles* I was just admiring how the colors of that top complement your complexion and all those cute moles on your skin.                                                                      Penelope: Hmph. Is that all you were admiring...?                                                   Orion: And... I must say your breasts look especially... breast-y today. I can say that, right? As  your manager.                                                                                       Penelope: *Giggles* Yeah, yeah, of course. Thank you. I'm glad you like them.                       Orion: (Liking them is an understatement...) But you know, I was wondering–                         Penelope: No, I'm not wearing a bra. As long as I don't start running or jumping, I don't need it   with this top.                                                                                      Orion: I see... Am I that easy to read?                                                             Penelope: Like an open book.                                                                        Orion: *Chuckles* Fair enough.                                                                      Penelope: What's the next thing you're going to ask me? If I'm not wearing panties either...?       Orion: Nah, I ju– *Looking at Penny's tight skirt* Wait... A-Are you serious? You're not wearing    underwear??                                                                                         Penelope: *Snorts* You should see your face right now. Of course I'm wearing panties! I'm not crazy enough to spend the whole day in class wearing such a short skirt without undies.                   Orion: *Chuckles* You sure love to keep me on my toes, eh?                                          Penelope: *Giggles* What can I say, it's one of my favorite pastimes. But anyway, we should get     going before we miss our session at the studio.                                                     Orion: Sure! Lead the way.                                                                          Penelope: Do you mind waiting for a minute here? I need to use that public bathroom real quick      before leaving.                                                                                     Tease her with the panties                                                                          Orion: Ah, going to take off your underwear now that class is over, right? Kinky... I like it.      Penelope: *Snorts* Who's the tease now, huh??                                                       Orion: Sorry, forget I said anything. I know you'd never dare to do something like that. Guess these kinds of “games” are for less prudish girls, my bad.                                               Penelope: *Chuckles* HAH! You did not just say that! Do you really think that trick will work?      Orion: *Chuckles* What trick? I’m just a truth-teller, speaking the truth. Truly.                   Penelope: Mm-hm.                                                                                    Orion: Feel free to prove me wrong, though.                                                         Penelope: I'm going to the bathroom for a touch-up and nothing else. That's all.                    Orion: I'll be right here.                                                                          Penelope: *Giggles* You’d better be.                                                                Nevermind                                                                                           Orion: Sure thing, I'll be right here.                                                              Penelope: I just need a touch-up. Be right back!                                                    Orion: (Oh boy... This woman's gonna be the end of me. Guess I'm gonna chill over there and wait for her to do her thing. Although she looked flawless already, I wonder what she's fixing. Women, I    guess.)                                                                                             Penelope rounds the corner, finding a quiet spot behind Kredon's bank. She settles by the stairs,   taking a moment to breathe.                                                                         Penelope: *Exhaling* Fuuuu... Better... *Groaning* (What on earth is going on with you, Penny? You  know that all this teasing with him isn't right. Why are you trying to bring trouble into your      life?! Agh... everything seemed crystal clear just a few hours ago. But then I saw him... and now   I’m like a middle school girl stressing about her first crush. Come on girl, have some self-respect. You said it yourself earlier today, remember??) *Groaning* (Hmph...)                               University Professor: And remember, in statistics: correlation does not imply causation. Always     delve deeper into the data!                                                                         Penelope: (Why the hell do we have to study stats for a journalism degree...?) *Sighs* (This is so  boring.)                                                                                            University Professor: Tomorrow we'll proceed to an even more thrilling statistical model!           Penelope: (Please don't say analysis of variance.)                                                  University Professor: Analysis of variance!                                                         Penelope: . . .                                                                                     Nova: *Groaning* MMMmmmmmmmmhhh...                                                                  Penelope: I know, girl, I know... isn't it weird how stats seem to appear in every degree? But hey, I guess it's all part of Kredon University’s whole “core curriculum” thing right? “Excellency in    every aspect of life” and all...                                                                    Nova: That's not it...                                                                              Penelope: Hmm?                                                                                      Nova: I'm still frustrated about the delay of the final episode of One Piece.                       Penelope: Oh... I see. But it was just a delay of a few weeks, wasn't it?                           Nova: But the thing is that I was supposed to watch it with Orion tomorrow, and I had prepared a ton of pirate-themed things to do with him and... now it's all ruined.                                 Penelope: Oohhh... I'm sorry.                                                                       Nova: Thank you...                                                                                  Penelope: So it was like a date?                                                                    Nova: We were– NO! N-Not at all! It was more like a... m-meeting between anime fans. Actually, we're going to spend most of the time playing in the pirate server with Nancy to try to find Coyote's    Gem! We're gonna be WAAAAAY too busy for anything else. I-I mean... it was NOT a date in the first  place. It wouldn't have been one even if we had all the time in the world.                          Penelope: *Giggles* Are you acting all nervous because I told you that I had a crush on him at the  party?                                                                                              Nova: W-WHAT?! NO!                                                                                  Penelope: Don't worry, I don't mind! We can share.                                                  Nova: What?! I don't... I mean... You wouldn't... I... WHAT?!                                       Penelope: I'll actually see him later today, you know? Maybe I'll ask if he's up for dating both of us. Two for the price of one – a hot blonde and a hot redhead!                                      Nova: S-Stop joking!!! I told you that's not it!                                                    Penelope: *Laughs* Okay, okay. *Laughs* Sorry, I was just messing around.                           Nova: I-I know.                                                                                     Penelope: *Chuckles* Anyway, I better head to my next class before I'm late.                        Nova: C-Can I ask you something before leaving?                                                     Penelope: Ask me something? Of course!                                                              Nova: Since you mentioned it... Is that... still a thing? I mean... Orion.                          Penelope: Oh... you mean if I still have a crush on Orion? Uh... no, not really. I mean... of course I like him, but not in that way, you know? It was just... the alcohol talking.                     Nova: Oh... I see. The alcohol.                                                                     Penelope: Yeah.                                                                                     Nova: Aha.                                                                                          Penelope: Yep.                                                                                      Nova: Roger that.                                                                                   Penelope: *Clears throat* Sooo... Do you wanna hang out tomorrow? Shopping? Just the two of us!     After you've recovered Coyote's Gem of Doom.                                                        Nova: Sure! Although... Orion is going to be at my house, so... maybe he'd like to come too.        Penelope: Oh! I thought you'd have postponed that too after the One Piece delay.                    Nova: Oh. No, I didn't. Aw, shit, should I have?                                                    Penelope: No! I just thought that–                                                                  Nova: Aaaaww, I should have totally canceled that. AAAAAAAAW... Why didn't I cancel it?! I'm such a fucking mess...                                                                                     Penelope: You know what... let's do something. How about spending the whole Sunday together? That   way, we can share every detail about our weekend! A whole day just for me and my BEST friend!       Nova: . . . *Giggles* I-Is that best friend me?                                                     Penelope: Of course! Who else could it be?                                                          Nova: *Giggles* O-Okay. *Giggles* Let's go shopping this Sunday. Me and my best friend. Penelope    Carter is my bestie.                                                                                Penelope: Is that a yes, then?                                                                      Nova: Hell yeah! I'm in! This way we can celebrate recovering Coyote's Gem!                         Penelope: *Chuckles* That's the attitude! I trust you guys can do it!                               Nova: We won't let you down!                                                                        Penelope: Alright then! It's settled. Now I've gotta go to the next class or I'm gonna be late.     Catch you later!                                                                                    Nova: Yeah, same! Later!                                                                            Penelope and Nova toss their laptops in their bags and head downstairs, ready to move to the next   class.                                                                                              Penelope: (Hmmm... Just the alcohol talking... sure. It's been days, yet he's still stuck in your   mind, Penny. Every single time you saw him yesterday at the medieval server you...) . . . (Maybe I'm the one who should cancel today's appointment with him...?) . . . *Sighs* (Anyway, let's focus on  the remaining classes for now. And I've still got four long hours ahead of me before meeting Orion. This is gonna be a looong day...) *Sighs* I better get going.                                       Penelope slides her laptop into her purse and heads downstairs, ready to move to the next class.    Penelope: (I fail to see how this is going to help me investigate a corrupt politician or interview a famous designer.) *Looking at the blackboard* (I wonder if Walter Cronkite was familiar with the  Chi-square distribution...)                                                                         Lily: There you are!                                                                                Penelope: Hmm? *Walking towards her* Oh, hey Lily! Do you have stats class now?                     Lily: Nah, I already did that. I just came here because I have something BIG to tell you! Are you   free tomorrow?                                                                                      Penelope: Uhh... not really. I'm playing with my sister.                                            Lily: Playing... ETERNUM?!                                                                          Penelope: Aha.                                                                                      Lily: Then you're in luck, girl, because I just got my own neural implant! We can play together now!Penelope: No way! Are you serious?! That's awesome! I'd love to play with you!                      Lily: Right?! So... what do you say? Tomorrow?                                                      Penelope: I'm sorry, I can’t! Like I said, I have a thing with my sister.                           Lily: Sunday, then?                                                                                 Penelope: I'm meeting Nova.                                                                         Lily: Today?!                                                                                       Penelope: You already know I have the photoshoot.                                                   Lily: Ah. Dammit, you sure are busy. I guess I'll have to settle for Marco or Regina for now.       Penelope: Huh?                                                                                      Lily: MARCO! I meant only Marco! S-Sorry, I forgot you have some beef with Regina.                  Penelope: Be honest, are you really into playing, or did you just get the game because I did and you thought it was the new “popular” thing to do?                                                      Lily: Ehh... Anyway, game chat can wait! Let's go to the photoshoot!                                Penelope: What?                                                                                     Lily: You need an assistant! And I offer myself! *Gasps* Do you think any famous people from Kredon will show up?! Because you're posting those pics later, right?! DON'T FORGET TO TAG ME!             Penelope: Oh... yeah, the thing is that I already have an “assistant”. Sort of. Orion is going with me. Sorry.                                                                                          Lily: Oh. Ah. Ew.                                                                                   Penelope: What now?                                                                                 Lily: I mean... your step-bro? Really? Ewww.                                                        Penelope: What are you talking about, he's not my step-anything.                                    Lily: Well, I know, but didn't you practically grow up around him? You even mentioned babysitting   him when your mom had to work.                                                                      Penelope: That literally only happened once, and... yeah, so what? That was ages ago.               Lily: Yeah, but he's still just 18. I swear, freshmen are so immature... but high schoolers? Total  kids in my book.                                                                                    Penelope: If you say so.                                                                            Lily: And I mean... what if you have to get naked with him around?                                  Penelope: I don't plan on that happening, don't worry.                                              Lily: Yeah, but it can still get weird! Like, imagine if he walks in while you're getting changed!  Think about how uncomfortable dinner would be at your place that day!                               Penelope: I-I mean... Y-Yeah, that would be... SO weird! Haha! Him seeing me naked?! N-No way!      Lily: I bet he's all about that! Guys these days are just a bunch of perverts, trust me! I wouldn't be shocked if he's plotting some shady “changing room thing” just to pull off some seriously gross  moves on you!                                                                                       Penelope: Oh god, no! Haha! That would be so... *Sticking her tongue out* Uggghhh... S-So... gross! Definitely NOT what I'd want. Nope.                                                                 Lily: Anyway... as long as he doesn't see more than he's supposed to, it's all good, I guess. I'll  leave you to it!                                                                                    Penelope: A-Aha.                                                                                    Lily: Let's catch up later, okay? And be careful with that boy!                                     Penelope: Y-Yeah, sure, I'll be... careful. Bye bye!                                                Lily: Bye, baby girl!                                                                               Lily exits the classroom.                                                                           Penelope: . . . Hmmm... (Maybe I shouldn't let Lily get to me, but... she's got a point. This is    just weird. I mean, I can't deny I enjoyed what happened at Regina's dorm. And yeah, I can't stop   thinking about him. But the trouble it'd cause... How would we even explain this to Mom or Dalia?   That's it. What happened between us was fun and everything, but it's time to move on! You can't be  fixated on Orion like some teenage crush, Penny. There's plenty more fish in the sea! I mean, check out my Instagram DMs! There are tons of hot guys hitting on me literally EVERY DAY.) . . . (Or maybe it's best to put boys on the back burner for now. I'll just focus on my career... or whatever      people usually say in these situations.) *Sighs* . . . (Oh shit, how long have I been here? Orion   must be wondering what's taking me so long. I should head back before he leaves without me! Should I go along with that joke about taking off my panties, though? Should I continue behaving the way I  have been around him, though? If I've truly decided that this isn't going anywhere, should I really continue teasing him?) . . . *Standing up* (No, of course not! What the hell are you thinking,      Penny?! IT'S OVER!) . . . (But then again... If I make a big deal out of it, am I not making it less casual than what it should be? Which is exactly what I'm trying to avoid. We're just two friends   goofing around. Maybe I should just keep acting like usual. I mean... what's wrong with mutual      teasing? We're just having fun. There's nothing wrong with enjoying a bit of playful banter between us.) . . . (Right...?)                                                                              Orion: *Stretching out* (Damn, she's taking her time.)                                              Penelope: *Running* Hi! Pardon the wait!                                                            Orion: Hey! No worries, I was busy people-watching. *Looking at Penelope's hair and makeup* (I don't see any difference. Probably better not to comment on anything...) So, ready to go?                Penelope: Yes! The studio's just around the corner, follow me.                                      Orion: Right beside you, m'lady. Ahh, we're here! So exciting! And damn girl, check out that        scaffolding. This place looks huge. And very professional.                                          Penelope: Right?                                                                                    Orion: It feels like a huge step up from the first studio we visited.                               Penelope: Oh, because it is!                                                                        Orion: Is it? I thought the first time you said that one was your favorite studio.                  Penelope: My favorite at the time! The modeling world is like climbing a ladder, Orion! Start at    small photo studios, move up to larger ones, then land the cover of the Ulysses magazine... And     ultimately become someone who can influence the entire world!                                       Orion: *Laughs* I love your optimism.                                                               Penelope: Actually, I'm not even kidding – this photoshoot might even get us closer to Ulysses.     That's why I was so eager to take on this offer.                                                    Orion: Really? How?                                                                                 Penelope: It's meant to be used to promote a new racing and car-tuning server. You know, for those  flashy online ads.                                                                                  Orion: Oh, seriously? That's awesome! So... the idea is putting a super hot girl next to a car to   boost people's attention by 200%, correct?                                                          Penelope: *Chuckles* I guess that was pretty much their reasoning, yes.                             Orion: Clever bastards. But hey, you're right, this could push us closer to Ulysses! It's always a  good thing to have more strings to pull.                                                            Penelope: Exactly! I was happy to be able to contribute something to the team.                      Orion: Don't say that, you've–                                                                      Philippe: *Slamming the door* UH!                                                                   Penelope: Hmm?                                                                                      Philippe: PENELOPE P. CARTER.                                                                       Penelope: Philippe!                                                                                 Philippe: Don't “Philippe” me, darling! I've been waiting for you for thirty long minutes! I told   you I need to leave before 6!                                                                       Penelope: I know! But you said that you just need 5 minutes to do my hair! You can leave afterward! Philippe: OH! And does that give you the right to keep me waiting?! People in this town would KILL  to have me as their stylist, you know?!                                                             Penelope: I know! I'm sorry, Philly, please forgive me...                                           Philippe: *Checking Penny out* Hmmm... Agh, you're lucky you're as stunning as a Vietnamese lotus   flower, sweetheart.                                                                                 Penelope: So... you forgive me?!                                                                    Philippe: *Pushing Penelope* Yes, but now move, move, MOVE! I have a reservation at Cipriani in 40  minutes!                                                                                            Penelope: Okay, okay!                                                                               Philippe: I'll do your hair and leave. Your outfit's in the locker behind the main backdrop.        Penelope: Ehh...                                                                                    Philippe: Don't give me that look – I already adjusted it for your bust, sugar, no worries.         Orion: Alright then, I'll go ahead and wait for you in the studio.                                  Philippe: Hmm? Ohh... you brought your photographer friend! Good to see you, Orion.                 Orion: Thank you, Philippe!                                                                         Philippe: Oh, darling, you look so much better than the last time I saw you. What a glow up!        Orion: *Chuckles* Thank you.                                                                        Philippe: Gosh, I would LOVE to work with your hair. A classic men's side-swept hairstyle would look absolutely DIVINE on you! Have you ever thought about giving it a try?                             Orion: Uh... not really. I don't usually spend much time combing my hair, but... I could try, I     guess.                                                                                              Philippe: Fabulous! I could style your hair myself.                                                 Orion: Sounds good.                                                                                 Philippe: We can swing by my place, grab a couple of Cosmopolitans, and–                            Penelope: Hey!                                                                                      Philippe: Oh, honey, don't be jealous! You know you and Paul are the only apples of my eye!         Penelope: Didn't seem like it just a moment ago...                                                  Philippe: Don't frown so much or you'll get wrinkles on that pretty face of yours! Anyway, let's get this show on the road. It was good to see you again, Orion!                                        Orion: Likewise! Catch you later, Penny. (Alright, I'll go wait for Penny where the photo backdrop  is. Let's see what they have around here...)                                                        You make your way around the scaffolds and find a well-equipped space filled with an array of       photography gadgets.                                                                                Orion: (No fucking way... Is that... Holy shit! A Lamborghini! Is Penny supposed to take photos next to it? That's so cool!) *Getting closer* (Man, I'd love to drive a lambo someday. The sensation of speed has to be incredible. Hmmm... are there more cars over there? I wonder what's hiding under    these tarpaulins. Maybe GT cars? Rally? Perhaps I should unveil them and have a peek...)            Aspen: HANDS OFF THE CARS.                                                                          Orion: F-Fuck, you startled me!                                                                     Aspen: All materials presently in the studio belong to Ulysses Inc. and must not be damaged,        spoiled, or otherwise exposed under any circumstances.                                              Orion: Okay, okay, jeez. Who are you anyway...?                                                     Aspen: Aspen Simmons, Regional Marketing Coordinator at Ulysses Inc., responsible for overseeing    publicity productions in Kredon.                                                                    Orion: Why do you speak like a robot...?                                                            Aspen: . . .                                                                                        Orion: I-I mean, nice to meet you! I'm Orion Richards – Penelope Carter's representative. And...    photographer. Manager?                                                                              Aspen: Ah, good. I was about to call you. The session has been canceled.                            Orion: Eh? Wait... what? Why?!                                                                      Aspen: The commission was transferred to a more experienced subcontractor. Nico Valentino. His      agency will manage the ad contract with Ulysses Inc. and conduct the session with his own models.   Orion: WHAT?! You've got to be kidding me, not that dude again! He did the EXACT same thing last    time! He also showed up at the studio last minute and tried to kick us out!                         Aspen: Welcome to the modeling world. A universe where only connections and owed favors will ever   get you somewhere, and real talent doesn't mean shit.                                               Orion: Come on, are you really going to let him get away with this?                                 Aspen: He controls the studios, he controls the contracts.                                          Orion: But we need this session! Penelope was really counting on it!                                Aspen: *Sarcastic tone* I'm devastated by your increeeedibly tragic story, but the answer is still  no. Now move.                                                                                       Orion: . . .                                                                                        Get tough                                                                                           Orion: Okay, no. Just no. Fuck you and your shitty attitude. We booked this studio for an hour      today, we had a prior agreement with the company you work for, and you can't cancel on us on such   short notice.                                                                                       Aspen: It's not my prob–                                                                            Orion: I swear to god, if you cut us out now, I'll work night and day until you're fired for this   and you end up begging for coins in front of Kredon's bank.                                         Aspen: . . .                                                                                        Bribe her                                                                                           Orion: *Sighs* Okay, I get it. How much do you want?                                                Aspen: . . . How much do you have?                                                                  Orion: Ahhh, so now you can suddenly squeeze us in, huh??                                           Aspen: You know? Forget it...                                                                       Orion: No, no, wait! Alright, how about... 100 eternals? I could transfer them to you right now. For the... trouble.                                                                                    Aspen: Hmm... 150 eternals. 20 minutes with the Lambo.                                              Orion: (Greedy bitch...) Okay, done.                                                                Be nice                                                                                             Orion: I understand your position, and I know you're just following protocol, but please! I'm       begging you!                                                                                        Aspen: I'm sorry. There's nothing more I can do.                                                    Orion: *Sighs* Dammit...                                                                            Penelope: What's going on?                                                                          Orion: Penny! Wow, you look so pretty!                                                              Penelope: *Giggles* Thanks! Philippe said this style would be the best one for the shoot! He said   that “it merges elegance with a touch of controlled chaos”, which is the vibe they aim to capture   for the racing server.                                                                              Orion: He nailed it!                                                                                Penelope: Is there any problem, though?                                                             Orion: Nothing to worry about. We were just... having a little conversation.                        Penelope: Yeah, I overheard you arguing. You sounded... authoritative. So, is the... issue resolved?Orion: I'm not sure. Is it...?                                                                      Aspen: Hmmm... Is this your model...?                                                               Orion: Yes. An upcoming model set to revolutionize the essence of the Ulysses brand.                Aspen: Hmmm. . . .                                                                                  Orion: I mean, look at her. My only question is, would you rather be the one who overlooks this     opportunity, or the visionary who uncovers her potential?                                           Aspen: Hmph. . . . Ooookay... I think I can... squeeze you in before the next client arrives.       Orion: Excellent!                                                                                   Penelope: Oh my, what an agent I have. I overheard you arguing.                                     Orion: Not at all! I was just... finalizing the details with Aspen here. Right...?                  Aspen: Yes... that's right.                                                                         Penelope: I overheard you arguing.                                                                  Orion: Ehh... maybe. Turns out the contract was canceled at the last second.                        Penelope: Aw, are you serious? Does this mean we have to go home?                                   Orion: I think so... I'm so sorry, Penny.                                                           Aspen: Hmmm... Is this your model...?                                                               Orion: Huh? Yes, this is Penelope.                                                                  Aspen: Hmmm. . . . Hmph. Okay, I think I can... squeeze you in before the next client arrives.      Orion: Seriously? That's wonderful! Why the sudden change of opinion, though...?                    Aspen: Are you interested or not?                                                                   Orion: Y-Yes, yes!                                                                                  Aspen: *Taking a tablet out* You have 30 minutes before Mr. Valentino arrives.                      Penelope: Ugh, Valentino? That weirdo is here too? How can you work with him?                       Aspen: Yes, yes... he's a repulsive abuser who trades jobs for blowjobs, and we live in a dark world full of corruption and moral decay. Now, if I'm to fit you in, I need to rearrange some schedules  and create a new profile for you, which will take some time. So stop interrupting me and just answer my questions. Got it?                                                                              Penelope: Y-Yes. Understood.                                                                        Aspen: Alright...                                                                                   Orion: (Well, at least we get 30 minutes. It should be enough to take some good pics. I'm happy for Penny.)                                                                                             Aspen: Are you from Kredon?                                                                         Penelope: Born and raised.                                                                          Aspen: Okay...                                                                                      As she responds to Aspen's questions, you notice Penelope fidgeting and crossing her legs in a      nervous yet deliberate manner.                                                                      Orion: (Hmm? Why is she doing that? Does she need to go to the bathroom? Or perhaps... wait. No way. Did she actually take off her panties when she went to the bathroom?? I've gotta verify that...)   *Clears throat* Well... *Getting close to her* Thirty minutes is better than nothing.               Penelope: Definitely! After we're done setting up the profile, I'll quickly change and head to the  car. Just take some shots of me in different poses, that should do it.                              Orion: Sounds good.                                                                                 You slowly slide your hand beneath Penelope's short skirt.                                          Penelope: . . . *Whispering* Orion! W-What are you doing??!                                         Orion: *Whispering* Oh my, no panties today? *Whispering* You're quite the pervert...               Penelope: *Whispering* I... *Whispering* I thought that it would... *Whispering* F-Fuck, I don't    know what I thought, okay?? *Whispering* My mind's been a whirl lately, I'm sorry!                  Orion: *Whispering* Sorry for what? *Whispering* This is super hot!                                 Penelope: *Whispering* No, it's not, it's embarrassing!                                             Orion: *Whispering* That's what makes it hot! *Whispering* And don't lie to yourself, the risk and  the fact that I'm the only one around that knows it... that turns you on, doesn't it? *Whispering*  That's why you took them off in the bathroom.                                                       Penelope: *Whispering* Um... *Whispering* I...                                                      Orion: *Whispering* Don't lie to yourself...                                                        Penelope: *Whispering* O-Okay, maybe a bit, now please, stop it! *Whispering* This is not the ti–   She pauses mid-sentence as you smoothly slide one finger between Penelope's pussy lips, beginning to massage her with a rhythmic motion.                                                                Penelope: *Biting her lip* G-Goddaaaaammit, Orion.... *Whispering* P-Please s-stop this nooooow...  *Whispering* F-Fuck...                                                                              Aspen: Okay, this is ready. Now I'll ask you some personal questions to fill the form, alright?     Penelope: Huh? Ah! Questions, yes! I'm ready! Shoot!                                                Aspen: Okay... What's your Instagram account? I'll take your profile photo from your feed and we'll use that to contact you if needed.                                                                  Penelope: Uh... I-It's “miss”, underscore, “penny”.                                                 Aspen: Hmm... Okay, I see it. Damn, 185,000 followers. Not bad. Do you have any affiliate links?    Penelope: Affiliate? N-No. Not really. I just get some offers to wear certain outfits sometimes.    Aspen: Are you on TikTok? Facebook?                                                                 Penelope: Only Instagram.                                                                           Aspen: Uh, you sure are bad at making money. Anyway, let's fill in the personal data and get this   done with.                                                                                          Penelope: A-Aha... *Whispering* Orion, stop, please... not now...                                   Orion: *Whispering* Your pussy is so fucking wet, Penny. You’re absolutely dripping. *Whispering*   There's no better lie detector that that.                                                           Penelope: *Whispering* This is wrong...                                                             Orion: *Whispering* But...? I sense there's a “but”.                                                Penelope: *Whispering* B-But... fuck, it feels good...                                              Orion: *Whispering* So... you want me to continue?                                                  Penelope: *Whispering* I...                                                                         Orion: *Whispering* If you want me to stop you just have to say so.                                 Penelope: . . .                                                                                     Aspen: Okay, full name?                                                                             Penelope: P-Penelope Paige Carter.                                                                  Aspen: Age?                                                                                         Penelope: 21.                                                                                       Aspen: Height?                                                                                      Penelope: 5'8''.                                                                                    Aspen: Weight?                                                                                      Penelope: *Moans* Aahhh...                                                                          Aspen: *Raising an eyebrow* . . . Are you alright?                                                  Penelope: Yeah! S-Sorry, it's something I ate before. It didn't sit very well.                      Aspen: Hmm. Okay, just make sure not to throw up in the photo set. Anyway, weight?                  Penelope: Ehh... around... 143 or 145 lbs.                                                          Aspen: Cup size?                                                                                    Penelope: Uhh... 32F.                                                                               Aspen: 32F...? *Mumbling* Some have so much and others so little... Occupation?                     Penelope: I-I'm studying. Journalism at Kredon University.                                          Aspen: Marital status?                                                                              Penelope: S-Single.                                                                                 Aspen: Previous experience?                                                                         Penelope: P-Previous experience? Eh... n-not much. But... I'm willing to... learn... I’m a g-good   student. And I'm... mmmh... tremendously excited to start... w-working with you.                    Aspen: I'm sure you are... Okay, that should be everything we need. You have 30 minutes, starting   now.                                                                                                Penelope: *Pushing you away* AAh! Finally, thank you! I better hurry up, then! D-Do you know where  the lockers are?                                                                                    Aspen: Behind the main backdrop.                                                                    Penelope: Thanks! *Clears throat* Alright, be right back! It'll only be a minute!                   Orion: Let me know if you need a hand with that dress!                                              Penelope: *Snorts* Hmm.                                                                             Orion: *Chuckles* What?                                                                             Penelope: Was that a pun?                                                                           Orion: What pun? I was just asking if you needed any assistance.                                    Penelope: *Giggles* I think I've got this covered, thank you very much.                             Orion: Always happy to help.                                                                        Penelope: Ah, so you've been doing nothing but helping me until now?                                Orion: Absolutely nothing else.                                                                     Penelope: And how did that help me, exactly?                                                        Orion: I wanted you stress-free. A relaxed model is the secret sauce for photo magic. Trust me, as  an expert manager, I've got a keen eye for those subtle cues in pictures.                           Penelope: *Snorts* You sound so confident saying all that bullshit that it almost sounds true.      Orion: *Chuckles* The wanting to help you part was legit, though.                                   Penelope: You're fucking nuts... But alright, if you want to continue helping me... go get the      camera set and wait for me by the car, expert manager.                                              Orion: Consider it done!                                                                            Penelope dashes off to the locker rooms, giggling playfully.                                        Orion: (We might have gotten carried away a bit right there, but what I said was kind of true. She  really looks much more like herself when she's in this mood.) *Hiding your erection* (Although I    need to control myself, this woman turns me on way too easily...)                                   Aspen: . . .                                                                                        Orion: *Turning around* Um...                                                                       Aspen: Yeah, I don't give a shit about what's going on between you two. Now I'll ask you some       personal questions to fill the form, alright? Answer fast and to the point. We don't have all day.  Penelope: Fast and to the point, you got it!                                                        Aspen: Okay, full name?

Penelope: Something around... 143 or 145 lbs.                                                       Aspen: Cup size?                                                                                    Penelope: Uhh... 32F. Although it depends on–                                                       Aspen: Occupation?                                                                                  Penelope: I-I'm studying. Journalism at Kredon's University.                                        Aspen: Marital status?                                                                              Penelope: Single.                                                                                   Aspen: Previous experience?                                                                         Penelope: Experience...? You mean in modeling?                                                      Aspen: Yes? What else would I be referring to? I'm not setting up your Tinder profile, you know?    Penelope: *Nervous chuckle* O-Of course. I don't have much experience, just a couple other          photoshoots and my social media.                                                                    Aspen: I see... Okay, that should be everything we need. You can go now.                            Penelope: Sweet! I'll go get changed, then! It'll only be a minute!                                 Orion: Sure! Let me know if you need any help!                                                      Penelope: Will do!                                                                                  Penelope dashes off to the locker rooms.                                                            Orion: *Turning around* Alright, so what now?                                                       Aspen: Grab the camera from the table and come with me. Let's get this done with.                   Orion: S-Sure! (Why is this woman always so angry?)                                                 You accompany Aspen to the photoshoot set and get all the necessary equipment set up and ready to   go.                                                                                                 Aspen: Okay, you have 30 minutes, you hear me? Thirty. And if you happen to run into Valentino, you CANNOT tell him that you're also snapping pics for the new racing server promo. I'm putting my job  on the line for you two, so you better not fuck this up.                                            Orion: 30 minutes and not telling Valentino, got it.                                                Aspen: 29 now.                                                                                      Orion: *Grumbling* 29 minutes... got it.                                                            Aspen: *Sitting down* Let me know when you're done. I'm gonna be here.                              Orion: Are you not gonna give us some tips?                                                         Aspen: Weren't you such an expert? Suit yourself.                                                   Orion: Charming as always... What camera should I use?                                              Aspen: There's a Reflex on the table.                                                               Orion: *Picking the camera up* Oh yeah, I see it.                                                   Aspen: That thing costs more than a brand new neural implant, so you better watch out. You break it, you buy it.                                                                                        Orion: Yeah, I always heard photography was such an expensive hobby. Let me get adjusted to it      before Penny arrives... Okay, this is the zoom... the ISO button... and the manual focus. Say       cheeeese!                                                                                           Aspen: . . .                                                                                        Orion: Do you ever smile?                                                                           Aspen: The SD card is almost full, so I wouldn't fool around if I were you.                         Orion: You could have said that before I wasted a pic with you.                                     Aspen: 27 minutes.                                                                                  Orion: (I'm gonna kill this woman.)                                                                 Penelope: Okay, okay! I'm ready, sorry! We can begin!                                               Orion: Whoa... Holy shit, Penny...                                                                  Penelope: Do you like it?                                                                           Orion: You look beautiful...                                                                        Penelope: Apparently, the NPC who greets you on the server wears this exact outfit. Or... at least  very similar.                                                                                       Orion: I have no idea what she looks like, but I feel bad for anyone who joins that server thinking you're gonna be in it.                                                                              Penelope: *Giggles* Thank you...                                                                    Aspen: 25 minutes.                                                                                  Orion: Okay... (I'm so mesmerized by Penny that I can't even summon any anger anym–)                Aspen: And stop making that salivating dog expression.                                              Orion: (Although she's certainly testing my fucking patience...) *Clears throat* Um... alright, I'm thinking of snagging a few shots of you sitting on the car first. Then we can do some more with you lying on the hood or maybe even striking a pose on the side. What do you think?                     Penelope: Sounds great! *Sitting on the car* Make sure to make me look pretty!                      Orion: Don't worry, making you look anything less than perfect would defy the laws of photography.  Aspen: That was cheesy as fuck.                                                                     Orion: CAN YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?! That was the joke!                                                Aspen: 24 minutes...                                                                                Orion: *Taking a deep breath* Okay, sorry. *Looking through the camera* Let's start. I like this    angle. Just let me remove the umbrellas and adjust the lights... *Going back to the camera* Ah,     perfect. Nice. How many pictures do we have to send to Ulysses?                                     Aspen: You need to select 4 pictures. The only requirements are that the model has to be wearing    that dress, and the Lamborghini logo has to be in the frame.                                        Orion: Gotcha. This is gonna be one... Two... Three... (And how should the last one be? She really  looks good from any angle.) Hmm...                                                                  Leaning over the hood Lying on the hood Spread out in front of the hood Try another angle Go with   this one                                                                                            Orion: (Yeah, this is the one. My fucking god, her body is absolutely perfect. She sure knows how to pose...) Keep that expression!                                                                     Aspen: *Grabbing your camera* Okay, time's up!                                                      Orion: What? No chance it's been 30 minutes already.                                                Aspen: You have your 4 pics, and I have to take the SD card to the office outside the studio,       transfer your pics to my laptop, and send them over to the contractor. And I have to do all that    before Valentino struts in.                                                                         Orion: Seriously? Can't we just upload them straight to the U-cloud? What century is that camera    from?                                                                                               Aspen: Old cameras capture magic. More megapixels don't mean a better shot.                         Orion: If you say so...                                                                             Aspen: I'll be back in 10. Tell your model to start getting changed, I'd rather you weren't here by the time Valentino arrives. Less explaining for me that way.                                        Be nice                                                                                             Orion: Copy that. Hey, I know we've started off on the wrong foot, but... thanks for the            opportunity. I really appreciate it. (Might be better to try to get on her good side...)            Aspen: Hmph. You're... welcome. I really think she has... potential. But anyway, you've got 10      minutes to bounce! Capeesh?                                                                         Orion: Got it!                                                                                      Be rude                                                                                             Orion: Jesus, what a useless piece of shit. I'm baffled how you even got this gig in the first      place.                                                                                              Aspen: I've seen better insults in a middle-school Xbox chat. God, you're even lamer than I thought. You've got 10 minutes to bounce, got it?                                                           Orion: Yeah, yeah. I'd really like not to see you again either.                                     Aspen: Hmph.                                                                                        Orion: Welp, that sure was an express shoot. But goddamn, it was hot...                             Penelope: Yeah... hopefully we managed to take some good pics.                                      Orion: Trust me, we did.                                                                            Penelope: Good, good... This was fun. I love modeling. I missed it. It always makes me feel...      frisky.                                                                                             Orion: (Oh god, that look...) And I love snapping pics of you. Is it wrong if I say that I literally couldn't stop imagining you naked while you were doing all those suggestive poses?                 Penelope: *Giggles* Don't tempt me...                                                               Orion: I only wish we would have had a chance to capture some extra... special shots... for our     personal collection. You know... like we did last time.                                             Penelope: *Giggles* Ah yeah, that was also fun... Too bad she swiped the camera.                    Orion: Well... if that's the only hiccup, I could use my phone.                                     Penelope: *Giggles* Even then, someone could walk in at any moment.                                 Orion: I could lock the door. Or...                                                                 Penelope: *Giggles* You don't take a no for an answer, huh?                                         Orion: I'm doing it for you! Last time you looked like you were left wanting it...                  Penelope: Some spicy pics with this car would certainly be... memorable, I'll give you that.        Orion: Right?                                                                                       Penelope: Right...                                                                                  Orion: (Oh man, her sultry voice is enough to drive a man crazy.) So... is that a yes? Do you want a more intimate shoot... just for yourself? (Please say yes.)                                        Penelope: Hmm... Okay, if you can lock that door... we can do... another quick shoot. Just a bit    more... personal this time.                                                                         You slam a chair against the door and slide it under the knob.                                      Orion: *Trying to force the door open* (No chance no one can open this from the outside now.) Done! Huh? Penny? (Where the hell did she go?)                                                            Penelope: So... I've been thinking.                                                                 Orion: *Turning around* Hmm? Oh Lord...                                                             Penelope: Probably even a bit too much lately, but... *giggles* that's beside the point now. You    know, all this... fooling around between us?                                                        Orion: Aha...                                                                                       Penelope: I've come to the conclusion that... there's nothing wrong with it.                        Orion: Nothing wrong, no...                                                                         Penelope: I mean, we're just having fun. And isn't that what matters most?                          Orion: Those are my thoughts exactly...                                                             Penelope: Good! I just wanted to make sure we were on the same page. As long as we don't cross the  line... it's all good. It'd just bring waaay too many headaches... I don’t think either of us want  more drama in our lives.                                                                            Orion: And... where exactly are we drawing that line...?                                            Penelope: *Giggles* You know exactly where. So, before we continue with this little photo session... do you think we can control ourselves? Or should we hit the brakes right here?                     Orion: I'm known for my self-control. But I have a better question: do we want to? Like you said,   there's nothing wrong with a bit of... fooling around. Just a spicy photo session.                  Penelope: Exactly. Again, good to see we're on the same page.                                       Orion: The very same.                                                                               Penelope: Mm-hm...                                                                                  Penelope gracefully glides along the studio's light stand, leaning against it, and unveiling her    naked form before you.                                                                              Orion: Oh my fucking god...                                                                         Penelope: I'm glad I have a friend who I trust and with whom I can do these kinds of things, Orion. I would have never dared to do a naked session if it wasn't for you. Even if the photos were        supposed to be private.                                                                             Orion: It should be a crime to cover your body with clothes...                                      Penelope: *Giggles* Alright, so... come on, take a pic. Bring out the artist in you. Do you think   this pose enhances my... features?                                                                  Orion: I think it does, yes...                                                                      Penelope: I also want a picture with you.                                                           Orion: Just you and me?                                                                             Penelope: Mm-hm.                                                                                    Orion: With me... naked?                                                                            Penelope: Mm-hmmm...                                                                                Orion: *Chuckles* Very well. What kind of manager would I be if I refused such a simple request from my client?                                                                                         You race to shed your clothes, Penny’s gaze on you all the while. You notice her gaze growing more  and more lustful with every passing second.                                                         Orion: Do you like what you see? Do I look... artistic?                                             Penelope: *Giggles* Very much. I'll admit it's quite alluring to see you in this lighting. Regina's room was... too dark to appreciate it all.                                                          Orion: I could say the very same thing...                                                           Penelope: *Approaching you* Alright, big boy... Let's take a pic together. Do you remember last     time? You sitting, and me perched on top of you.                                                    Orion: I do...                                                                                      Penelope: Only this time... *giggles* I won't jump up all startled when I notice your junk, don't   worry.                                                                                              Orion: That sounds good...                                                                          Penelope: You can leave your phone on that tripod with timed shots enabled, or... even recording.   Then we can select the perfect shot and keep it for ourselves... sound good?                        Orion: That's a fantastic idea...                                                                   You grab your phone and set it up on a tripod, aiming the camera at the Lamborghini, and start      recording.                                                                                          Penelope: Good.                                                                                     Orion: Good...                                                                                      Penelope: *Sitting on the car* Are you okay? Your mind seems to be elsewhere, Orion.                Orion: I can assure you, my mind is only in one place in the world right now...                     Penelope: You're not secretly plotting to sell these pics online, right?                            Orion: I'd never let another man see you in your most glorious form.                                Penelope: Oh my, so selfish...                                                                      You sit on the car's hood next to Penelope.                                                         Penelope: *Climbing on top of you* Does it bother you if I sit like this? Or... is it too much...?  Orion: (Oh sweet Lord Jesus, she's not wasting any second...)                                       Penelope: ...Orion?                                                                                 Orion: Does it bother you if I touch you like this...?                                              Penelope: *Soft moan* Aahh... N-No, it doesn't...                                                   Orion: (Boy, I could never get enough of her massive, perfect tits... They're almost too much to    hold in just my hands.)                                                                             Penelope: *Soft moan* Mmmmh...                                                                      Orion: (And those perky nipples tell me she's as excited as I am...)                                Penelope: *Soft moan* Aahh...                                                                       Orion: Penny...                                                                                     Penelope: Yeah...?                                                                                  Orion: I might have overestimated my self-control... I-I'm having a hard time right now trying to   control myself...                                                                                   Penelope seizes your hands and redirects them downward.                                             Penelope: I'll admit that... I'm a bit horny right now too. But... that's normal. We're just humans after all. We have a history together, and this is quite an... explicit session. But as long as     we... don't cross... The line...                                                                    Orion: O-O-Oh my god...                                                                             Penelope: As long as we keep it... *Whispering* Professional...                                     Penny starts sensually gliding her hands up and down your shaft, pressing it against her pussy and  moistening it with her touch. You can practically feel her needy warmth.                            Orion: Oh, fuck...                                                                                  Penelope: *Whispering* God... *Whispering* I-It feels... so... massive...                           Orion: Oh, Penny...                                                                                 Penelope: *Whispering* So warm...                                                                   Penelope continues to touch your fully erect member as a prolonged silence surrounds you.           Penelope: *Deep exhale* Fuuu...                                                                     Orion: I-Is everything okay?                                                                        Penelope: Can I... C-Can I be frank with you, Orion?                                                Orion: Of course...                                                                                 Penelope: *Deep exhale* Okay... All this teasing between us... it started off as a game because I   just loved watching how jittery you'd get every single time. But... then... it went too far. That   day at Regina's room. It went way too far. I tried to stop... but I couldn't. I... I thought that if I acted casually about it, if I didn't make a big deal out of it... it would stay like that. As a  game. That I would stop thinking about you 24/7.                                                    Orion: And...?                                                                                      Penelope: And... *Biting her lip* F-FUCK, this isn't working, Orion. I'm... I-I think I'm a little  more than just a bit horny right now... It's... almost... Painful...                                Orion: You're not the only one feeling that way...                                                  Penelope: *Biting her lip* W-We probably should stop here for today... Before that other wild idea  of mine pops back into my head, and we end up regretting this forever.                              Orion: What other idea...?                                                                          Penelope: Ah... nothing. It was just... a c-crazy thought I had.                                    Orion: I'd really like to hear it...                                                                Penelope: It's not worth it. It was really crazy.                                                   Orion: I really like crazy ideas, Penny...                                                          Penelope: . . .                                                                                     Orion: Come on, please...                                                                           Penelope: Well... I thought... Um... imagine for a second... hypothetically... if there were        absolutely no consequences for your actions. Stay with me, alright?                                 Orion: Alright...                                                                                   Penelope: I thought that... Maybe... The solution to get rid of all this sexual tension between     us... Would be to... To... Actually... have... sex... once. Just... once.                           Orion: . . . W-What did you just say...?                                                            Penelope: I think it's my imagination that’s been driving me insane lately. So maybe if I just...   F-Feel it once. Instead of thinking about how you’d f-fuck... or about how your cock would feel it  my t-tight pussy... If I could just actually feel it once... Without feelings attached... *Caressing your dick* Maybe then... the sexual tension would ease up... And we could go back to being our     regular selves. Hah... crazy idea, right...?                                                        Orion: (Oh my fucking god, YES PLEASE...)                                                           Penelope: Am I crazy?                                                                               Orion: No, you're not...                                                                            Penelope: . . . . . . O-Okay... Let's keep it casual. I-I'm gonna try to... put it inside. Once.    Orion: (Oh sweet heavens.)                                                                          Penelope: Let's cross this line... just once. And after this... the game will be over. It will be... our secret. Forever. Deal...?                                                                      Orion: Deal...                                                                                      Penelope: Alright... Here goes nothing...                                                           Penelope sits up and lets out a moan as the head of your cock rubs against her pussy lips.          Penelope: *Moans* Aaahh...                                                                          Orion: (She's wet as fuck even without any kind of foreplay...)                                     Penelope: S-Shit... this is crazy, Orion. We're crazy.                                              Orion: This is the best idea you've ever had in your life.                                          Penelope: *Giggles* Of course you'd say that... Okay... Okay. Are you ready...?                     Orion: I'm not sure if I'm ready, but I certainly want it...                                        Penelope: *Deep exhale* . . .                                                                       After a brief moment of hesitation, she slowly lets the tip of your cock slide inside of her        dripping pussy.                                                                                     Penelope: *Moans* O-O-Oooohhh...                                                                    Orion: Oh god, FINALLY...                                                                           Penelope: F-F-fuck, IT'S IN.                                                                        Orion: It is...                                                                                     Penelope: MMMmmmmmMmmhhh... O-Ohhh wooOOOow, that feels... Holy fuck, Orion, that feels... G-Good... M-MY GODDDDD....                                                                                   Orion: Ooh PENNY.... (Oh my god, it's happening at last. No more teasing. No more games. I'm inside Penelope. I'm having sex with her. I’m fucking Penelope Carter. I'm living out the fantasy of what  her 180,000 followers can only dream of. And sweet Jesus, it feels good...)                         Penelope: *Moaning* Aaaghhh, Orion...                                                               Orion: F-Fuuuck yes, this is better than I imagined...                                              Penelope: *Giggles* Oh y-yeah? You thought about this...? Thought about fucking little old me?      Orion: All the fucking time...                                                                      Penelope: *Moaning* AAaaahhh... Just... a little bit faster...                                      Orion: Oh boy... Please, d-don't let me stop you...                                                 Penelope: Just... a little bit... okay...? AAAAAaaahhhhh... yeaaahh...                              Orion: Jesus Christ, that feels good, Penny...                                                      Penelope: Mmmmmhh... *giggles* y-yeah...                                                            Orion: W-Where the fuck did you learn to move like that?                                            Penelope: L-Like what...? I just imagine I'm... d-dancing... J-Just that it feels... so fucking     better... *Panting* AAaahhh....                                                                     Orion: Y-Yeaah, keep going...                                                                       Penelope: *Groaning* F-Fuck, you're so fucking big, Orion...                                        You can feel Penelope's tight cavity slowly adjust to your size. Each of her movements feels extra  sensitive on your dick.                                                                             Orion: Take it all...                                                                               Penelope: AAaahh...                                                                                 Orion: Take it balls deep...                                                                        Penelope: I c-can't... it’s t-too much...                                                           Orion: Try it for me, baby girl...                                                                  Penelope: I... A-Are you sure?                                                                      Orion: Don’t you wanna ditch this tension once and for all? And feel good and r-relaxed? We've      crossed the line already... might as well roll with it, right?                                      Penelope: *Giggles* That's a good point...                                                          Orion: You'll see how good it feels...                                                              Penelope: *Moaning* Okay... *Moaning* I'm g-gonna drop myself on you, yes...?                       Orion: Fuck yes...                                                                                  Penelope: O-Okay, here we go... *Moaning* OH GOD. OH MY FUCKING GOD.                                Penelope lets herself drop, the weight of her body slamming you against the car with each powerful  thrust.                                                                                             Penelope: *Screaming* AAAaaahhhh, fuck THAT'S HUGE...                                               Orion: O-Oh Penny...                                                                                Penelope: T-T-This is o-otherworldly...                                                             Orion: *Panting* Fuck, it really is... Ohhh f-fuck... FUUUUUCK...                                   Penelope: *Panting* P-Please, please don't cummm... Please let me cum first...                      Orion: You're asking for a lot there, Penny...                                                      Penelope: I-I need to cum so I can get rid of the... tension... I need it... I need to... I n-need  to do this... Please... *Moans* AAAaaaAahh... M-My god, this feels better with each passing         second... aaaahhhh... how the fuck is this possible... *Panting* AAAaahhh... aAAAAAahh...           aaaaahhhhhh...                                                                                      Orion: Holy shit...                                                                                 Penelope: *Squeals* AAAAAAAAGHHH!                                                                   Orion: Oh y-yeah, good girl...                                                                      Penelope: O-Oh my god, Orion, you're stretching me out so much...                                   Orion: Y-You're taking it like a pro, Penny...                                                      Penelope: Ohhhhh god....                                                                            Orion: That's it, babe, ride that dick... Keep riding it like that...                               Penelope: Oh, Orion...                                                                              Orion: Penny...                                                                                     Penny’s jiggling, voluptuous body fills your every sense, as each individual bounce and thrust      causes your body to radiate with a divine pleasure.                                                 Penelope: *Panting* AAAah... aaaaaahhh... aaaaahhhh... *Panting* F-Fuck, I'm getting tired, Orion... *Panting* B-But I don't want it to stop... *Panting* Not when I'm this close... *Panting* Not when it feels... t-this good...                                                                          Orion: (Maybe now that she's gotten used to it, I can let her “rest” and simply relish the          pleasure...) Now it’s my turn to ask... Are you ready?                                              Penelope: *Panting* Ready... f-for what...? OH MY F-FUCKING GOD...........!!!                       Orion: OH FUCK YESSS....

You wanted me to fuck you this hard from the         beginning... always teasing, always flirting...                                                     Penelope: O-Oh Lord, t-this is unbelievable...                                                      Orion: You wanted this, didn’t you, you naughty girl?                                               Penelope: F-Fuck YESSSS, I did... Fuck me hard, Orion...                                            Orion: Oh I will...                                                                                 You keep hammering Penelope's pussy, your ears drowning in her small, constant whimpers of pleasure.Penelope: *Panting* I-I'm gonna cum so hard, Orion... *Panting* I'm almost there... *Panting*       P-Please don't s-slow down...                                                                       Orion: I'm gonna give you the orgasm of your life... You’ll never forget this...                    Penelope: AAAAAAAHAHHH YEAAAAHHHH...!!! *Biting her tongue* MMMMmmMMMmhhhh!!!!                      Orion: *Panting* O-Oh god... I knew you'd love it hard...                                           Penelope: *Noises of pleasure* MmmMmmggggGGggghhh!                                                  Orion: (I don't think anyone could take it as roughly as she does... She’s a total sex freak... I   can literally feel the tip of my cock poking the innermost parts of her.)                           Penelope: MmmMmmgggmmmmmh....                                                                       Orion: (I feel so fucking powerful destroying her slender body like this...)                        Penelope: AAAAaahhhh...                                                                             Orion: (And she seems to like all of it... This is gonna leave a mark.)                             Penelope: MmmMMmmmmmh!!                                                                             Orion: *Panting* A-Are you gonna cum?

Penelope orgasms, soaking your cock in vaginal fluids and contracting all of her muscles at once.   She faints on top of you, utterly dazed, her legs still trembling uncontrollably.                   Penelope: *Breathing heavily* AAaAAAaaahghh . . . . . .                                             Orion: *Catching your breath* Oh, Penny... Fuck, that was intense.                                  Penelope: *Breathing heavily* . . .                                                                 Orion: Got rid of all that sexual tension, eh?                                                      Penelope: *Breathing heavily* Mm-hmmm....                                                           Orion: Glad I could be of service... (Man, I can't believe I just fucked Penny. I was literally just a few seconds away from cumming too. But I can't really ask much more of her, to be honest. That   was insane.)

Penelope: *Whispering* Break me.......                                                              Orion: Eh?

Penelope: I want you... I want you to break me. I want you to fuck me again until you ruin me... And again... and again. Grab me and use me as rough as you can... don’t give me a second or a moment to breathe... *Whispering* I want you to destroy me...                                                Orion: A-Are you fucking serious?                                                                   Penelope: C’mon... you were talking such a big game earlier, Orion... Split me in half...           Orion: Oh, baby...

Penelope: *Moaning* Yeah... F-Fuck me... Fuck me with that monster fucking cock of yours... give me what I need... Shove every inch of it inside of me...                                               You continue to hammer her relentlessly, feeling how your dick breaks the resistance that her tight insides offer with each stroke.

Orion: Ahhhh... Dear Lord, about time I get a good look at these tits of yours... You have no right to be this hot...                                                                                   Penelope: *Moaning* AAAaaahhh...                                                                    Orion: I fucking love how your boobs bounce...                                                      Penelope: T-They're all yours... I told you, e-everything is yours... *Moans* AAAaaaaAAaahh... D-Do with me as you please... *Moaning* Just don't stop fucking me ever...

Penelope: *Squeals* AAAAAaghhh...

Orion: *Panting* Not with you...                                                                    Penelope: *Panting* O-O-Oh my goddd... *Panting* I need... t-to rest... AAAAAAAAHHH....

A-Aren't you even gonna let  me–                                                                                                 Orion: Your tits are the fucking best I've ever seen in my life, Penny, but goddamn, this butt of   yours deserves some attention too...                                                                Penelope: *Giggles* Please, put it back inside...                                                   Orion: Your wish is my command...                                                                   You suddenly penetrate her, cutting her off.                                                        Penelope: AAaaaaaaahhhh... MY G-GOD, I GUESS NOT... MMmmmmMmmmmm... Y-YEAAAHHHHHH...

Orion: *Panting* God...                                                                             Penelope: *Panting* I d-don't give a shit anymore... *Panting* I don't give a shit about            consequences... *Panting* I just want you to fuck me every day... *Panting* J-Just take your cock   and fucking give it to me... *Panting* I want Mom and Dalia to hear me scream...

Orion: D-Do you even realize we're fucking on a $400,000 car?                                       Penelope: *Panting* F-Fuck yeah we are.... *Giggles* And that makes it so much hotter...            AaAAaaahhhhhhh... Crush me against this car, Orion... *Giggles* L-Let's see if it breaks before I   do...                                                                                               Orion: Oh yeah, Penny...                                                                            Penelope: *Panting* AAAaahhh... *Panting* I never imagined I could ever feel so filled... *Panting* D-Don't slow down, please...                                                                        Orion: (I knew Penny had hinted she was into rough sex, but... holy fuck. We're rutting like fucking animals in the middle of mating season. And she's enjoying it as much as I am.)                    Penelope: *Moans* MMMMmmmMMmmhh...                                                                  Orion: (No, she’s definitely enjoying it more...)                                                   Penelope: *Moans* AAAaaaahhh... Oh d-d-dear LORD... I can't even feel my legs anymore...            AAAAAAAAGHHHHH... YEAHHH... Fuck, I c-can't...                                                      Penelope's legs give out, and you both tumble onto the floor.                                       Penelope: AAAAAAAAHHH.... my GODDDDD.....!!!!                                                       Orion: F-Fuck yes... Y-You told me yourself that you wanted me to fuck you without giving you time  to even breathe, didn't you...?

AAAAAAAAahhh... *Panting* Fuck    me...                                                                                               Finish                                                                                              Orion: I-I'm at my limit, Penny...                                                                  Penelope: *Panting* AAaaa.... aaaahhh... aaaaaahhh...                                               Orion: *Panting* I'm gonna cum... *Panting* I'M GONNA...                                            You hear a sudden noise.                                                                            Orion: *Suddenly stopping* W-What was that?                                                         Penelope: MMMmmmmmmhmmm...                                                                          Orion: H-Hold on... THE DOOR! Someone just kicked the door open! Shit, I totally forgot about where we are! We have to get out of here!                                                                 Penelope: *Giggles* Oh nooo...                                                                      Orion: *Whispering* S-Shit, Penny, keep it down! We need to leave!                                  Penelope: Keep fucking me...                                                                        Orion: *Whispering* Don't you realize that if they catch us they're gonna hit us with a massive fee for property damage?!                                                                               Penelope: *Giggles* I'm the damaged property here... *Blowing you* Please, make me cum again...     *Blowing you* Pretty pretty please...?                                                              Orion: G-G-Ggggghhhh... P-Pennyyy s-stay quieeeeet...                                               Mr. Valentino: *Pushing aside the curtains* This is the last time I work with this shitty studio,   you hear me?! I couldn't even get inside! UNBELIEVABLE!                                             Aspen: I-I don't know what happened, Mr. Valentino, I'm so sorry! Someone from the cleaning staff   must have forgotten to–                                                                             Mr. Valentino: Don't sell me that bullshit, bitch! Now go find my girl and tell her to start getting changed!                                                                                           Aspen: Y-Yes, right away, Mr. Valentino!                                                            Mr. Valentino: Then why are you still here?! Move, you fucking incompetent dog!                     Aspen: Y-Yes!                                                                                       Mr. Valentino: Hmm... *Sighs* (This is what happens when you give women any kind of important job.  Anyway... at least the car's good to go. I'm gonna get that emo bitch fired as soon as Ulysses gives us the contract.) *Typing* (She'll regret having disrespected me like that...)                     Orion: *Whispering* J-Jesus...                                                                      Penelope: MMmMmMmmmmhh...                                                                           Orion: (Oh Lord... What the fuck is happening to me...? If we get caught, we're gonna get in BIG    trouble. But I just... Fuck, I just can't seem to stop...)                                          Penelope: *Biting down on her panties with force* MMMMMGH!                                          Orion: (Please, just a little bit more...)                                                          Penelope: MMMMmmmmmh...                                                                             Orion: (The sounds she makes... The way her body feels... Or the way she absolutely LOVES being     dominated... Every single thing about Penny just makes me want to turn into an animal and unleash my primal instincts.)                                                                                 Penelope: MMMMMmmmmmHHHHH...                                                                        Orion: (She not only managed to keep up with my rhythm, but she relished every single second of     it... If I hadn't put her panties in her mouth, her moans would have revealed us already.)          Penelope: MMMmmmmMmMmmmhh...                                                                        Orion: (We need to leave...)                                                                        Penelope: MMMMMMMHHHHHHhhh...                                                                       Orion: But I NEED to cum first...                                                                   Penelope: MMMMMMMMMmmmMMHHHHmHHhhh...                                                               Orion: I'm finally almost there... My balls are about to explode...                                 Penelope: MMMMMmmmmMMMMmmmMMHHHHmmHHhhh...                                                          Orion: I'm...                                                                                       Cum inside                                                                                          Orion: *Trying to repress your groans* AAAAAAaaaaahhh... AAaaaaahhh... AAaaaaaaAAAAaaaaaaaahhhhh... F-Fuuuuuuck...                                                                                      You can feel how Penelope orgasms again at the same time as you finish unloading an insane amount of jizz deep inside her warm vagina.                                                                  Orion: *Whispering* Take it all... *Whispering* Oh, Penny... That was... Glorious...                Cum outside                                                                                         Orion: FUCK, COME HERE... I wanna turn your beautiful body into a fucking mess... *Trying to repress your groans* AAAAAAaaaaahhh... AAaaaaahhh... AAaaaaaaAAAAaaaaaaaahhhhh... F-Fuuuuuuck...           As you take a step back, Penelope's legs finally surrender and she crumples onto the floor,         completely spent.                                                                                   Orion: *Panting* Oh god, Penny...                                                                   Penelope: *Panting* Gggg-gG-gg-gggghhh...                                                           Orion: W-What?                                                                                      Penelope: *Panting* AAAAaaaagahhhgh...                                                              Orion: (I-I’d better give her a minute.)                                                            Mr. Valentino: Hmm? (What the hell was that noise?) Hello?? Is there anyone there?                  Orion: *Whispering* F-Fuck! He heard us! *Whispering* Shit, shit shit... Penny, we've gotta get out of here!                                                                                            Penelope: *Panting* AAAAaahhhgghgh.... *Panting* I f-feel like I juust got r-rammed by arr bull...  *Giggles* A bull...                                                                                 Orion: *Whispering* Penny, focus! *Whispering* Snap out of it!                                      Mr. Valentino: ASPEN?? Is that you?                                                                 Orion: *Whispering* PENNY! HE'S COMING THIS WAY! *Whispering* I NEED YOU TO STAND UP! *Whispering* I CAN'T CARRY YOU AWAY LIKE A POTATO SACK!                                                           Penelope: *Giggles* Hahahahhgaa... *Panting* Potato...                                              Orion: *Whispering* Goddammit!                                                                      Mr. Valentino: Hmph. (There's no one here. Maybe something toppled from the scaffolding. This place is filthy as fuck, though. I swear, this is the last gig with this studio.) *Sniffs* (And seriously, what the fuck is this stench? Smells like the Lamborghini... It seems... kinda familiar, but I     can't quite put my finger on it. Perhaps our cleaning crews are using the same cleaning supplies?)  Orion: Hmmm... Hmm. *Touching the floor* Mmmh? What...? Why is it so dark? What is this...?         You stand up and start analyzing the oppressive darkness enveloping you, only to discover that your neck is ensnared by a chain tethered to a rock structure.                                           Orion: *Pulling the chain* WHAT?! W-What the fuck is going on?! HELLO?! Where am I?!                ???: Heads.                                                                                         Orion: Huh?? Who's there? Idriel...?                                                                Idriel: Welcome back, Orion.                                                                        Orion: What... where am I? Is this a dream? No... it's way too vivid to be a dream... Am I in...    Eternum?                                                                                            Idriel: You are.                                                                                    Orion: But... how...? I don't remember logging in. I... I don't remember how I got here at all.     And... w-why am I imprisoned?!                                                                      Idriel: This is not your prison, Orion. It is mine.                                                 Orion: What...?                                                                                     Idriel: This is the Limbo. A place in Eternum beyond space. Beyond time.                            Orion: Beyond time? So... time is frozen while we're here?                                          Idriel: Time isn't frozen, nor is it flowing. It simply doesn't exist in this place.                Orion: Uh... okay. And what about outside this place?                                               Idriel: There is no “outside” while we're here. Limits are non-existent in Limbo, making the notion of something beyond it... inconceivable.                                                            Orion: . . . That doesn't make any sense.                                                           Idriel: Trying to comprehend eternity as mortals is as futile as explaining color to a person born  blind. But you've been making progress. Your mind seems to be more receptive than it used to be.    Orion: I talked to William Bardot. He told me that Eternum isn't a creation of the Founder, but a   discovery.                                                                                          Idriel: Do you believe him?                                                                         Orion: I... I don't trust him, but I do believe him, yes. I'm kinda shocked at how quickly I've     accepted this new “reality”, but... I genuinely believe it's true. I think deep down... it just     seems like it’s the truth. The NPCs... they're real. They were once humans. And they're trapped in  here. I must free them.                                                                             Idriel: You must gather the 10 Gems of Doom. Once you have them all, Eternum will be yours. Only you can do it. Only you can save them.                                                                 Orion: Then help me! Aren't you the Lady of Eternum?!                                               Idriel: I am ensnared here, Orion. Beyond the confines of the Limbo... I'm but a puppet, a hollow   vessel. Akin to all the others.                                                                     Orion: Then stop with all your stupid riddles, just tell me where the Gems are! Tell me where to go, what to do, how I can defeat the Founder! How can I help free anyone if you won’t help me?         Idriel: That would be in vain. You won't remember. You never do.                                    Orion: What...? Then why engage in this conversation at all?                                        Idriel: I thought you might have different questions this time.                                     Orion: You just said I won't remember, so what's the point?                                         Idriel: Perhaps you're still not asking the right question.                                         Orion: The right question...?                                                                       Idriel: You must keep moving forward, Orion. You must help us. That is the only way. The only hope. Orion: But... how? I'm just a guy. Why not try to seek someone else’s help?                         Idriel: There is no other way, Orion.                                                               Orion: How do you know there isn't another option?                                                  Idriel: Because we've seen it. Because we've already tried.                                         Orion: Tried...?                                                                                    Idriel: Keep moving forward, Orion. Defy fate. Break. The. Chain.                                   Orion: *Sitting up* AAAAH!!! *Panting* (Holy fuck... God... I'm drenched in sweat... I feel like    Dalia after a workout. T-The one time I actually have a dream, and it goes like that.) *Touching    your neck where the chain was* (That was a messed up nightmare. Or... at least I hope it was a      nightmare. Better than suffering from the bleeding effect... Ah, Kredon's rain is back. Three days  in a row without it was too much to ask, I guess.)                                                  Your phone buzzes.                                                                                  Orion: *Grabbing your phone* (Hmmm... oh, it's a message from Penny. Damn, it's all coming back to  me now... We arrived crazy late, and she crashed immediately. I went on a mission to clear out half the fridge, and then I went to bed as well. Man, that sex was WILD. Penny's a damn succubus... We   didn't even get a chance to chat about what happened. She was too wiped out for that – I practically had to drag her home.) *Popping open your chat app* (Time to suss out what the deal is... Damn...  I'm glad to see things with Penny didn't get awkward. Boy, I can't wait to see her again... Hmmm... they say they went to the gym with Dalia and Annie. Oh boy, I wish I could have joined them. All    three of them rocking gym leggings has to be a sight to behold...) *Sighs* (Aaahh...) *Slapping your cheeks* (But alright, let's focus now! Time to get dressed and head over to Nova's place to log    into that pirate server. Time to get dressed and start getting ready to log into that pirate server. I thing I'm even gonna go grab some breakfast at Loco's before playing. I've gotta hit the ground  running! So no more daydreaming about women for today, Orion. You have a Gem to snag!)              You put on your clothes, grab your backpack and umbrella, and step out of your room.                Nancy: Good morning, honey!                                                                         Orion: *Turning around* Ah, good morning Na- *Gulps* N-Nancy. (Guess today's                        “no-daydreaming-about-women” vow was short-lived... Goddammit, that bathrobe is a menace.) D-Doing  some laundry?                                                                                       Nancy: Yeah! The girls headed out to the gym a few minutes ago, so I thought I'd get some chores    done before logging in with you and Nova.                                                           Orion: Solid plan.                                                                                  Nancy: I noticed Penny was particularly smiley today. Guess yesterday's photoshoot was a hit?       Orion: Eh? Ah, y-yeah! It went really smoothly, I'd say. I mean, we won't be certain about that     contract from Ulysses until a few days have passed, but I'm feeling pretty positive. We took some   killer pics.                                                                                        Nancy: Mm-mh. Is there... anything else you wanna spill?                                            Orion: Spill? L-Like what...?                                                                       Nancy: I don't know. You tell me.                                                                   Orion: N-Not really, no. That's about it.                                                           Nancy: Hmm.                                                                                         Orion: *Clears throat* Uhh... well, I'm excited to play with you and Nova today! Aren't you?? It's  been a while!                                                                                       Nancy: Ah, yes! Me too! Mind if I grab a few more minutes? I'm almost done.                         Orion: Sure! I still have to go to her house, actually. It's about a 20-minute walk, so we're not in any rush.                                                                                          Nancy: Ah, yeah, I forgot you were playing from her place.                                          Orion: I'm going to Loco's to buy some breakfast first, so we're not in any rush.                   Nancy: Ah, going to see Luna? You sure are quite the playboy, aren't you? Jumping from one date to  another. *Sighs* If we weren't so busy, I'd probably suggest taking advantage of this alone time    between you and me...                                                                               Orion: W-What? I-It's not like that, I'm just going to Nova's to play. We're just friends. W-What?  I'm just going to grab breakfast! Luna's not even going to be there, just her dad! And besides,     we're just friends, nothing more!                                                                   Nancy: Yeah, we're all really lucky to have you as our friend.                                      Orion: That said... I've gotta say you look even sexier than usual somehow, Nancy. If you were      serious about seizing the empty house...                                                            Nancy: Oh, I was... But no time, unfortunately! We'll have to leave that for another day! Yeah,     they're all really lucky to have you as their friend... But you're right, it's time to move!        Orion: But–                                                                                         Nancy: Come on, let's get ready, we're running late! Hop, hop!                                      Orion: O-Okay, when should we meet? Or where?                                                       Nancy: I'll send you both an invite to the New World server in 30 or 40 minutes! I've got something pretty awesome to show you!                                                                         Orion: Oh, really? What is it?                                                                      Nancy: Nuh-uh! It's a surprise!                                                                     Orion: But–                                                                                         Nancy: See you later, sweetie!                                                                      Nancy glides past you, her breasts gently swaying with each step, exuding a seductive allure as she trots along.                                                                                        Orion: (Oh boy... I can see where Penny inherited her love for teasing me. These women are gonna    make me lose my mind... Sometimes I feel like I'm living with constant blue balls. But anyway, she's right. No time to waste if I want to get there on time. I hope Nova's all set. Let's roll!) LET'S  GO! (Alright, here we are. If I'm not mistaken, I arrived just in time.) *Ringing the doorbell*     (Heh, I still remember the first time I met Nova, right here at this door. What a cringe-fest that  was. But hey, after a gazillion adventures together, here we are, poised for... Um... I'm not even  sure what this is supposed to be. We were supposed to watch the last episode of One Piece together, then it was delayed, but we didn't cancel the date. Date. Date? Is this even a date? Hmm... Bah,    don't overthink it, Orion. Don't be nervous. I mean, I'm not nervous. Am I nervous? Why am I        nervous?! It's just Nova! We practically live in each other's pockets!) *Ringing the doorbell*      (Speaking of, where the fuck is this girl?!) *Ringing the doorbell* Hello?!                         Nova: Yes, yes, sorry! Come in! It's open!                                                          You stroll into Nova's place, umbrella in hand, and drop it right by the door.                      Orion: *Taking your jacket off* Ah, finding refuge from the rain feels like such a relief! It's     starting to get chilly out there these days.                                                        Nova: I'm sorry, I was in the middle of wrapping up a game! You can drop the package right there!   *Closing the door behind her* Do you need me to sign anything or... Eh?                             Orion: Package? What package?                                                                       Nova: Orion? You're not the Amazon guy.                                                             Orion: Uh... nope.                                                                                  Nova: What are you doing here?                                                                      Orion: Um... You invited me over. To watch the last episode of One Piece. And join Nancy on The New World server. The “pirate-themed” day... r-remember? (Did she really forget...?)                    Nova: Oh... but... the episode of One Piece got delayed.                                            Orion: Well... yeah, but we didn't scrap the whole plan for the day, so... I figured... I thought we were still on for the rest of it.                                                                  Nova: Oh... damn, I just assumed we called it off and that we'd play from our own respective places.Orion: Ah. Oh.                                                                                      Nova: . . .                                                                                         Orion: Well, this is awkward. Um... might be better if I just head out then. We can p–              Nova: NO! No! You can stay! It's just that... I didn't even think about it ALL week, so I honestly  didn't prepare anything.                                                                            Orion: Oh well, if that's the only problem, no worries!                                             Nova: Agh, I bet you were hoping for a ton of SUPER cool and fun activities and even delicious      homemade food, huh?                                                                                 Orion: Not rea–                                                                                     Nova: I COMPLETELY spaced on our meet-up plans, I'm SO sorry.                                       Orion: No need to apologize, Nova, it's all good. We've all been having a ton of things in our heads recently. (Looks like I was the only one overthinking today's stuff after all.) Let's just enjoy   our time together. We're gonna be in Eternum for most of the day anyway.                            Nova: Alright, then you can go to the guest room. My room's a bit of a chaos zone right now, so     we'll probably be more comfortable there.                                                           Orion: Alright, cool!                                                                               Nova: It's the second room on the right after you head upstairs. I'm gonna change into the E-suit   real quick and join you, make yourself at home!                                                     Orion: Thanks! (I guess it's this one. Man, I feel like a bit of an idiot. I should've texted her   before showing up.) *Sighs* (But anyway, now I'm already here. I guess we should just dive into     Eternum, focus on the mission, and forget about it. After all, nothing beats playing Eternum on a   rainy day.)                                                                                         Nova: *Closing the door behind her* Alright, I'm ready!                                             Orion: Damn, that was fast.                                                                         Nova: *Jumping onto the bed next to you* Again, sorry for blanking on today. I completely forgot.   I'll prepare a SUPER FUN event next time, I promise.                                                Orion: And also again, don't worry, Nova. I'm happy just hanging out with you, no need to prepare   anything. Now, let's snag that Gem from Coyote and take it home, shall we?!                         Nova: YES! *Turning around* I'll let you change into the E-suit too.                                Orion: *Starting to get changed* I don't mind if you look, don't worry. Wouldn't be the first       time...                                                                                             Nova: No way!                                                                                       Orion: *Chuckles* Okay, okay, as you wish. You know, now that I take a closer look, I'm digging this new hairstyle of yours!                                                                            Nova: What, this? It's just a quick fix because it's practical and I was short on time.             Orion: Oh, really? You didn't even have to straighten your hair?                                    Nova: Not really. It depends on... the day. Sometimes it's more straight on its own.                Orion: Is that how it works...?                                                                     Nova: Really, it just took me 3 minutes. But anyway... you ready?                                   Orion: Yep!                                                                                         Nova: *Turning around* Cool!                                                                        Orion: Should we grab something to eat before jumping into the game? I don't know how long we're    gonna be playing, I guess it depends on how fast we can find Coyote's base.                         Nova: I don't know... I already had breakfast. Let's just go with the flow.                         Orion: I'm fine with that.                                                                          Nova: Just chilling, you know, this is... nothing special. We didn't even remember our plans until a few minutes ago, so what's the big deal, right?                                                    Orion: Well... I kinda did.                                                                         Nova: No biggie. Just a laid-back Saturday. You can't really have any high expectations for a normal Saturday, am I right? Just a regular, uneventful Saturday.                                         Orion: I didn't come with any high expectations.                                                    Nova: Anyway, aren't you getting bored? Let's play already. I'm sooo bored. Aren't you?             Orion: Um...                                                                                        Nova: Let's play, and then we can decide if we should casually grab something from the fridge,      depending on the time. You know, the kind of things we all do on a normal Saturday.                 Orion: Mm-hm.                                                                                       Nova: Just burning some ti–                                                                         Sandra: *Slamming open the door* There you are!                                                     Nova: . . .                                                                                         Sandra: I thought you'd be in your room, not the guest one!                                         Nova: *Standing up* M-Mom?! I told you to knock on my door! And can you NOT slam the doors like     that?!                                                                                              Sandra: It's so good to see you again, Orion!                                                       Orion: Thank you, Ms. Johnson! I had no idea you were home! I'm sorry, I would have said hello if   I'd known.                                                                                          Sandra: Ah, don't worry about that, sweetie. I just came to bring you some cappuccinos!             Orion: Oh, thank you so much!                                                                       Nova: Yeah, yeah, thanks, Mom. Can you give us some privacy now?                                    Sandra: I'm so glad you're finally here! Nova was practically chewing her nails off all week        thinking about today.                                                                               Nova: NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE!                                                                          Orion: Is that so...? And here I thought it was just a regular Saturday for her...                  Sandra: *Laughs* She was crushed when they canceled those pirate cartoons you were going to watch   together! Yesterday she spent the whole day whining and brainstorming plans for today.              Nova: T-That's because I really wanted to see that episode, so it was a bummer!                     Sandra: She even attempted to bake a special dessert herself! Unfortunately, we had to bid it       farewell because she kinda... set it on fire. ...and the kitchen too... again.                      Nova: I-I only bake once in a while. A-And it's not my fault the oven doesn't make any noise when   the timer's up!                                                                                     Orion: *Laughs* So... is there anything else Nova had planned for today?                            Sandra: She tried to draw one of those Japanese comics of hers for you, but she wasn't happy with   how it turned out, so she tossed it away.                                                           Nova: I'll try it again another day.                                                                Sandra: Then I suggested a cartoon marathon, but she wasn't sold on that either.                    Nova: Orion wouldn't have liked that. He's too... cool to spend a whole day watching anime with me. Sandra: Oh, and did you see the new hairstyle she whipped up for you? She spent a good three hours  this morning, trying to straighten her hair and comb it just right. I even had to give her a hand!  Orion: Oh, really?? She told me it only took her three minutes and was just a quick, casual style.  Nova: W-Well, yeah, it might have taken a bit more time than 3 minutes, now that I think about it... I thought you were referring to my scrunchy, actually.                                             Sandra: *Chuckles* I'm so glad to have you with us, Orion. It's such a relief to finally see Nova   with a thoughtful and handsome boy instead of alone with her computer. Seeing her with such a big   crush takes me back to my younger days!                                                             Nova: OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH FOR TODAY! Thank you for the coffees, Mom! See you later!                 Sandra: Your dad and I are heading out now, but if you two are planning to get cozy, remember to–   Nova:  OH MY GOD, SHUT UP!!!!!!! *Pushing her mom away* OKAY, BYE!                                  Sandra: Bye guys, enjoy your Eternum session!                                                       Orion: Thank you, Ms. Johnson!                                                                      Nova slides around the corner of her wardrobe while you casually take a seat on her bed, smirking,  without saying a word.                                                                              Nova: Sorry about that, my mom can be a pain sometimes. A-And she has such an imagination on her, my god.                                                                                               Orion: *Chuckles* I knew that hairstyle didn't take you only three minutes.                         Nova: I did it for myself, seriously, so it’s okay if you don't like it – I won't feel bad.         Orion: What are you talking about? I lo–                                                            Nova: SERIOUSLY! I won't feel bad. It's better if you don't say anything.                           Orion: But–                                                                                         Nova: I'm trying to work on my self-esteem and anxiety, so I don't need so much validation from     others anymore. A simple nod when you notice is more than enough. Like... “huh, new hairstyle, Nova? Huh. Cool.”                                                                                        Orion: *Laughs* Alright, got it. I did catch your new hairstyle today, yeah.                        Nova: Yes, I was going for something that looked kinda pirate-y.                                    Orion: Mmh, I can see that.                                                                         Nova: Yuuup.                                                                                        Orion: . . . Sooo... should we log in now? Nancy must be waiting for us already.                    Nova: Yep!                                                                                          Orion: . . .                                                                                        Nova: Any last comments before getting down to business?                                            Orion: Mmmmhh not really, no.                                                                       Nova: I mean, you can say something about my hairstyle if you want to.                              Orion: Yeah, I already saw it. It's new.                                                            Nova: Mm-hm. Cool.                                                                                  Orion: Hmph.                                                                                        Nova: Hmm.                                                                                          Orion: . . .                                                                                        Nova: . . .                                                                                         Orion: . . .                                                                                        Nova: OKAY, FORGET EVERYTHING I SAID – I NEED COMPLIMENTS OR I'M GONNA STARVE AND DIE!              Orion: I-I LOVE IT, YOU LOOK SO CUTE!                                                               Nova: *Giggles* Thanks.                                                                             Orion: *Laughs* You're something else. I'm serious though, you really look lovely with this         hairstyle. Oh, and want another one? Those pants you had on earlier? Your tummy looked extra sexy   with them...                                                                                        Nova: *Giggles* Thank you, thank you.                                                               Orion: Okay, so... let me guess. You thought I'd come in here with sky-high expectations, but when  the episode got delayed, you totally freaked out thinking I'd get bored and start disliking you. Is that why you've been acting all weird since I arrived?                                              Nova: Eh... *Giggles* Something like that.                                                          Orion: *Chuckles* You're such a goofball. It's literally impossible to get bored around you. You    manage to turn the most mundane stuff into a wild whirlpool, and I love it.                         Nova: T-Thank you.                                                                                  Orion: And now that that's been said... can we switch back to being normal now?                     Nova: *Chuckles* Yes, we can.                                                                       Orion: Sweet! Now buckle up because I'm taking the reins on our date agenda today. No veto power for you today!                                                                                         Nova: *Giggles* Okay.                                                                               Orion: (I knew she'd like me to call it a “date”.) First up, we're diving into Eternum to snag that Gem of Doom from El Coyote. Then, we'll take a break, and I'll swing by Mario's Pizza to grab a     couple of calzones. We'll chow down together, and after that, it's decision time: anime, video      games, or another round of Eternum on a random server, just the two of us. You call the shots!      Sounds good?                                                                                        Nova: Sounds awesome.                                                                               Orion: Nice! So, Ms. Delilah Warren... ready to get our third Gem of Doom?!                         Nova: *Bumping your fist* Heck yeah!                                                                Orion: READY TO DESTROY EL COYOTE AND THE REST OF HIS CREW?!                                        Nova: YES!                                                                                          Orion: READY TO CONQUER ETERNUM?!                                                                   Nova: YES!!!!                                                                                       Orion: LEEEEEET'S GO!!! *Gagging* Uggghhh... This seasickness is killing me... how much longer are  we going to be stuck drifting in this never-ending ocean...?                                        Nova: *Hopping onto the ship's rail* Orion! Check out the sea! We finally got a break from those    relentless waves! The ocean's as calm as a kiddie pool right now.                                   Orion: Yaaay... Can we spot any islands yet? I'm dying to finally set foot on solid ground...       Nova: Not yet, but Nancy said we're already headed back to Tortuga.                                 Orion: Tortuga?                                                                                     Nova: The island where we started. The one with the Exit Portal, that tavern, and all those pirates.Orion: Ohhh... yeah, it's been so long that I had almost forgotten. *Leaning on the rail* I mean,   how long have we been going in circles??                                                            Nova: Since we left Tortuga? I'd say... about 6 hours or so.                                        Orion: Only?! It felt like I spent an eternity surrounded by nothing but water.                     Nancy: *Leaning on the rail as well* For being the strongest among us, you sure can't handle a      little water, Orion!                                                                                Orion: Because I can't control it! Getting dizzy isn't about strength or skill...                   Nancy: *Chuckles* Still, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed.                                  Orion: *Clears throat* Well, now that the waves have chilled, I'm feeling better.                   Nova: Ah...                                                                                         Orion: Did I say better? I meant much better.                                                       Nancy: Oh...                                                                                        Orion: Actually, scratch that – I'm feeling TOP-NOTCH already!                                      Nova: OH!                                                                                           Orion: See? I can recover suuuper fast. It's all about discipline! I'm ready to kick some asses     again!                                                                                              Nancy: *Laughs* Ah yes, that's the resilient and mighty warrior I know.                             Orion: BUT OF COURSE! *Chuckles* I know what you did there, by the way. But it successfully got me  all pumped up again, so I won't complain.                                                           Nova: So... we scoured all the supposed trading routes of El Coyote's ships, checked every rumored  hiding spot, and still came up empty-handed. Do you think he managed to slip away from us again?    Orion: He's got to be around. The WRE turned the world upside down – land, air, and sea, and this   server is the last hiding spot he has left. He's just lurking somewhere with his Gem like a coward. Nancy: Oh, we'll track him down, no doubt, just that... it might take a bit longer than we thought. Orion: I could see him for myself in the Wild West server. He's got a good network of informants,   but he's not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed. He'll slip up eventually. But anyway, we can    save the El Coyote hunt for tomorrow. I don't know about you, but I'm absolutely famished right     now.                                                                                                Nova: Me too!                                                                                       Nancy: The Captain mentioned earlier that if winds play nice we should be back in Tortuga in less   than 20 minutes.                                                                                    Orion: Ah, sweet! I promised someone pizza for lunch, and I can't risk her being mad at me. I mean, we're already behind schedule, so it'll really be dinner. But still.                                Nova: *Laughs* You do well to fear me! I can be scarier than Dalia when I'm hungry.                 Nancy: *Chuckles* No time to waste, then!                                                           Orion: To Tortuga it is, then!                                                                      Nancy: *Getting up* Maximo!                                                                         Maximo: *Climbing down the stairs* Yes, my Empress?                                                 Nancy: Could you go to the lower decks and inform the crew that we're going back to Tortuga? Tell   them to orient the sails towards North-East to optimize speed, and ensure the staysails are         efficiently deployed! Full-speed ahead!                                                             Maximo: Right away, your Highness!                                                                  Orion: *Standing up* Oh damn, you're turning into an expert sailor now too?!                        Nancy: *Chuckles* Obviously. I must master all domains where the WRE can make an impact. I devour a book or two every week about different disciplines to stay ahead. This week's pick was “Sailing of  the Golden Era.”                                                                                    Orion: Sometimes I wonder where you find the time. I feel like I'm busier than ever, and next to you it looks like I don't do shit. You've got your full-time job, you take care of Dalia, Penny, Annie and me, AND you still have time to run an Empire with a military network spying on half the servers in Eternum. How do you even manage that?                                                            Nancy: You’re also constantly helping us, Orion. Whether it's supporting Dalia's competitions,      Penny's photoshoots, Luna's family get-togethers, being Annie's rock since forever, or simply       chilling with Nova today.                                                                           Orion: Well... hanging out with all of you is the best part of my day. I would hardly call that a   “sacrifice” on my part.                                                                             Nancy: That doesn't make it any less significant. You're the glue holding us together, Orion. Don't ever forget that. *Turning around* But alright, let's not get into melodrama mode again! Mastering  the art of time management, that's the key! I could school you on it someday.                       Orion: *Chuckles* Yeah, I could use some of that. I appreciate it.                                  Nancy: *Turning around* But alright, let's leave that for another time! We've got more fun things to do and more work to tackle!                                                                        Orion: *Chuckles* Alright.                                                                          Nancy: Gentlemen! Sails up! . . . Mmmh?                                                             Orion: Huh?                                                                                         Nancy: Where's everyone at...? I thought I asked Maximo to round up the crew on deck, didn't I?     Nova: Now that you mention it, I haven't seen a single sailor up here in a while. Maybe they're all taking a nap?                                                                                       Nancy: Do you think so? That'd be extremely lazy, even for these guys... And do you know what's even weirder? There's no noise at all... Just the ship rocking with the waves and the distant seagull   calls.                                                                                              Orion: I know you're there, I can sense your presence.                                              Nova: Huh??                                                                                         Orion: Open the door and step out.                                                                  You hear a deliberate, ominous laugh coming from behind the closed doors.                           Boone: *Dragging Maximo alongside him* Well, well, well... Looks like your reputation is            well-deserved... Nobody. Or should I just call you Orion?                                           Orion: Boone...? Who are you? And how do you know me?                                               Nancy: *Gasps* Maximo!                                                                              Nova: W-Who's this guy?! Do you know him??                                                          Orion: I do know him... His name's Boone. He's the guy from the Frontier Trails server that I met   with Dalia, the one who spilled about El Coyote's hideouts. But... what the hell, Boone? You told me you left his gang!                                                                                 Boone: Indeed, he doesn't know me. But I had the pleasure to meet your charming companion, Dalia,   when she paid me a visit in my cabin.                                                               Orion: You...? You're the one Dalia talked to? You're the source of all the intel on El Coyote's    hideouts??                                                                                          Boone: *Grabbing his bandana* You see... That man you dueled and dropped in Blackridge? He was just a decoy. One of my guys.                                                                            Orion: What...?                                                                                     Boone tosses his bandana to the ground, stepping on it furiously.                                   El Coyote: I AM EL COYOTE.                                                                          Orion: What...? You son of a bitch... (Fuck, I knew something was off about the 'El Coyote' I       encountered in Blackridge. He seemed too weak to own a Gem of Doom, let alone avoid Thanatos's      pursuit for so long. I can't believe I let him fool me.) But... this doesn't make any sense, why did you tell us your own hiding spots? Why not just come after me directly?                            El Coyote: Because I needed you here, in The New World. I need your help, Orion, I'm not ashamed to admit it.                                                                                           Orion: My help...?                                                                                  El Coyote: Although, gotta say, it took you a freaking eternity to get here, and now time's running out. So, be a good sport and pay attention, will ya? Oh, and before you even think about calling for backup... your crew's done for. Dead. Kaput.                                                       Orion: Motherfucker...                                                                              El Coyote: Now, now, no need to have a potty mouth! Swearing like a sailor on this ship? Just       behave, and your dear friend here won't meet his maker.                                             Maximo: I will gladly give my life for the WRE and the Empress! Don't heed the demands of this      terrorist, General!                                                                                 El Coyote: Inspiring loyalty! *Mocking tone* What will you do, General...?                          Don't listen to his demands                                                                         Orion: I won't bow to your demands. Hand over your Gem, or prepare for the consequences. I won't ask twice.                                                                                             El Coyote: Agh, looks like your pals don't give a fuck about your well-being, Maximo. If you ever   fancy joining a crew that values loyalty as much as you, you can come find me. Unlike your general  here, I'd lay down my own life for any of my comrades. *Sighs* Such a pity you're on the wrong side of this tale.                                                                                       Orion: (Holy shit, he didn't even flinch...)                                                        Nancy: MAXIMO, NO!                                                                                  Negotiate                                                                                           Orion: *Motioning to Nova to lower her gun* Let Maximo go first. I won't entertain any of your      demands until you release him.                                                                      El Coyote: Aww, look at that, Maximo. Isn't it endearing how he cares about his crew? That's        something I can respect, yes. Very well! Consider this a token of goodwill.                         El Coyote releases Maximo, who slumps to the floor from the pressure applied to his neck and crawls away gasping for breath.                                                                            El Coyote: *Pointing the gun at you* Alright, ladies and gentlemen! I guess now that we're finally  in a more intimate setting, it's time to have a quick, yet fruitful conversation. First things      first, I've got one condition!                                                                      Nancy: Oh my god, that was fast! You nearly vanished into thin air there!                           Nova: *Panting* D-Dead? He dead? I-Is he dead?                                                      Orion: . . .                                                                                        El Coyote: Hahahahah... Yes... YES! You didn't even hesitate! I could sense your determination from the day I saw you... I was right to choose you...                                                   Nova: What in the world is that...                                                                  Orion: . . . *Smirks* Hmmm. Another decoy... Looks like our friend El Coyote here prefers pulling   strings from the shadows, am I right?                                                               El Coyote: I've always favored staying hidden over exposing myself. If it wasn't for this little    habit of mine, I'd probably have lost my Gem of Doom a long time ago.                               Orion: Okay then... spill it. What do you want from me? The two Gems of Doom we have?               El Coyote: Incorrect! Actually, I'm willing to hand over the one I've got. As much as I take pride  in my deceptive skills, I'm aware I can't compete in this race at the same level as the others. So, I thought of taking a little advantage of the situation.                                            Orion: Why me?                                                                                      El Coyote: Well, out of the strongest contenders out there, you seemed to be the most... reasonable one. At least more so than Thanatos.                                                                Orion: And what do you want in exchange?                                                            El Coyote: The Heart of the Abyss. A treasure that resides on the Island of the Lost Souls. But     here's the tricky part: it only surfaces once a year during the 11th lunar cycle, which conveniently ends... today! I would have preferred to give you more leeway, but you took your sweet time coming to see me.                                                                                          Orion: A treasure in exchange for your Gem of Doom? And why didn't you go get it yourself?          El Coyote: The Island of the Lost Souls is more than 100 miles away from the nearest Exit Portal,   heavily guarded by mortal dangers. And, as I said, one of my strengths is recognizing both my       abilities and shortcomings. I knew I'd never make it through the journey. But you?! You can pull it off! Bring me The Heart of the Abyss and my Gem of Doom will be yours!                              Orion: Mmh. And how do I even know where to find this island?                                       El Coyote: Go back to Tortuga and seek out Gypsy Goldtooth at the tavern! He will tell you how to   find the island and provide you with a map!                                                         Orion: Hmph.                                                                                        El Coyote: You've got exactly 16 hours left! As soon as the sun rises tomorrow, the Island of the   Lost Souls will vanish along with The Heart of the Abyss. And, of course, my Gem of Doom will remain forever out of your reach! *Laughs* You know how sneaky I can be, don't you?! 16 hours, Orion! The clock is ticking!                                                                                   El Coyote falls silent as you feel how life abandons his avatar. You let El Coyote's decoy crumple, lifeless, and turn towards the girls after regaining your normal appearance.                        Orion: Well... Looks like that cunning bastard was one step ahead of us the entire time.            Nancy: You can say that again... we might have underestimated him.                                  Orion: Oh, we definitely did. Primarily because I mistook El Coyote for that foolish guy I dueled in Blackridge. But this one? Ohhh yeah, it all makes more sense now. *Smirks* THIS is a worthy        opponent.                                                                                           Nancy: I feel bad for Maximo.                                                                       Orion: Well, at least we can hold onto all the loot here on the ship and return it to him and the   other WRE members when they can play again.                                                         Nancy: *Sighs* Yeah, that's true. Anyway... what's the plan now? Do we even have one? And what's the plan now?                                                                                          Orion: What do you mean? Isn't it obvious? I'm not one to shy away from a challenge when it's       presented to me. We're going to track down that treasure and use it to trade for our 3rd Gem of     Doom!                                                                                               Nova: HELL YES!                                                                                     Nancy: YEAH!                                                                                        Maximo: *Kicking the floor* Thank you for saving my life, General!                                  Orion: Oh, it was nothing, Maximo. I couldn't let you bite the dust that easily, not after all      you've done for us.                                                                                 Maximo: I pledge to dedicate my entire life to the WRE, Empress Nancy, and to you, my General!      Orion: *Playing along* I expected no less from someone of your caliber. (Maximo really takes        roleplaying to a whole new level. Some players truly immerse themselves in Eternum, even though     they're completely unaware of the reality beneath it all.)                                          Maximo: I request permission to name my child, due in two months in the real world, Orion the Great!Orion: (M-Maybe even immerse a little bit too much.) Um... that won't be necessary, Maximo.         Maximo: I insist, General! Please!                                                                  Orion: P-Perhaps you should discuss that with your wife first.                                      Maximo: She's named our other two lovely children already. Now, it's my turn.                       Accept                                                                                              Orion: Uh... w-well, okay then. But just Orion is fine. No need for... “the Great”.                 Maximo: Excellent idea, General! We shall name him Orion!                                           Refuse                                                                                              Orion: You might want to consider a different name, Maximo, really. It makes me feel kind of        awkward, to be honest. How about something like... Maximo Jr., or... I don't know, Victor, or Chang, or...                                                                                              Maximo: Excellent idea, General! We shall name him Chang!                                           Orion: Uh... t-that's not what I was trying to–                                                     Maximo: I'll go take control of the rudder to ensure a safe return to Tortuga now! Permission to    proceed?                                                                                            Orion: Um... yeah, of course. You're dismissed.                                                     Maximo: Thank you!                                                                                  Orion: *Turning around* He's certainly committed to his role, huh?                                  Nancy: *Laughs* Definitely, no one can say otherwise.                                               Orion: Can we go back to Tortuga with just the four of us? Can we go back to Tortuga with just the  three of us?                                                                                        Nancy: We can! The sails are set, the sea's calm, and we've already got our course dialed in.       Tortuga should be on the horizon in less than 5 minutes.                                            Orion: Excellent! El Coyote mentioned that the “Island of the Lost Souls” is around 100 nautical    miles away. How long do you figure it'll take us to cover that distance?                            Nancy: Well, considering this ship can hit speeds of 14 or 15 knots... I'd say about 7 or 8 hours.  Maybe a bit longer if we run into some setbacks along the way.                                      Orion: That's good enough!                                                                          Nancy: But we'll need to recruit a fresh crew. At least 3 more members, especially since Maximo is  leaving once we reach Tortuga. But we'll need to recruit a fresh crew. At least 3 more members.     Orion: I see... *Kicking the floor* ALRIGHT! Here's the new plan: we head back to Tortuga, split up across town, and drop a few signs announcing our need for emergency sailors. Big reward, of course! After that, we log off, grab a quick bite, toilet, and then dive back in! 15 minutes max! We gather our new sailors, set sail on this new adventure, and we bag that treasure before tomorrow's sunrise! Sounds good?!                                                                                      Nova: Oh... So we have to log back in that quickly?                                                 Orion: Of course! This is a BIG opportunity! We can't afford to let it slip away! Every Gem gets us closer to our ultimate goal!                                                                        Nova: Oh... I mean... yeah, you’re right.                                                           Orion: You okay, Nova? Is anything wrong?                                                           Nova: No... no. Of course not. Alright, let's head back to Tortuga ASAP then! Full-speed ahead!     Orion: That's the spirit!                                                                           Nova: Sounds good to me!                                                                            Nancy: Solid plan!                                                                                  Orion: To Tortuga it is, then! *Leaning on the rail* Here we go... (It's weird. For some reason, I  got all fired up when El Coyote proved to be a real challenge. Am I getting addicted to adrenaline  or what? Mmh, well, in any case, living a real pirate adventure sounds so damn exciting!) Man, I    haven't been this pumped in a while! *Looking at the horizon* This Gem of Doom will be ours... COME ON EVERYONE ! ! ! FULL SP– Ouch. W-What was that for? What did I do now?!                           Nancy: How can you be so dense?!                                                                    Orion: What??                                                                                       Nancy: Didn't you notice how crushed Nova looked when you dropped the new plan bomb?                Orion: Did she...?                                                                                  Nancy: Didn't you guys already have plans?                                                          Orion: I mean... yeah, we did, but we can't pass up on this! The third Gem of Doom is right there   for us to take!                                                                                     Nancy: It's not about changing plans, it's about the way you said it. You made it seem like you     didn't give a damn.                                                                                 Orion: What?! That's not true! (Did I really come off that way? Shit, I'm bummed about delaying our anime-binging date too, but maybe Nancy has a point. I could've been more considerate in breaking   the news. Especially knowing how much Nova had been looking forward to today.) Okay, now I feel     bad.                                                                                                Nancy: With good reason.                                                                            Orion: Maybe... we don't have to rush so much. Would it be alright if we take a bit more time before logging back in? I'd really like to have a leisurely lunch with Nova and maybe catch an episode or two of something.                                                                                   Nancy: Now, that's better. See how it's not that hard? Nova is a sensitive soul – you've got to be  mindful of that.                                                                                    Orion: I guess you're right.                                                                        Nancy: I'm sure she'll love that... “readjustment” of the plan. And to answer your question, yes,   we've got plenty of time, so no worries. How about we reconvene in, let's say... 3 hours? Back in   Tortuga?                                                                                            Orion: Perfect!                                                                                     Nancy: Just make sure you both savor a good meal... After this little break, we won't be able to log off until we lay our hands on that treasure!                                                       Orion: Gotcha! We will! Thanks Nancy.                                                               Nancy: You can thank me later... Now, go on, you can continue yelling at the ocean until we arrive. Orion: *Laughs* Thanks, I appreciate it. *Looking at the horizon* (This Gem of Doom will be ours... Ahh... Tortuga. The mecca of piracy. Booze, gambling, disreputable women, and shady grog houses with poor sanitation. The perfect haven for any despicable pirate chasing some fortune! Too bad we don't have time to enjoy this picturesque place. Or maybe... luckily. For better or for worse, we've     gotta keep moving. I should go to the tavern and ask for... Gypsy Goldtooth, was it? Without that   map, we're not going anywhere. The Last Resort Tavern. And Shop. It should be here. I hope I can    locate him quickly, Nancy and Nova will likely have all the crew members recruited quickly. Let's do this!)                                                                                             You confidently step into the quaint, crowded tavern, enveloped in the comforting scent of aged     wood, liquor, and lingering smoke.                                                                  Orion: (Huh, not bad. This place has a cozier vibe than I thought it would. Damn, are those the     bones of a real mermaid? That's pretty cool. I wonder what other weird stuff lurks in that          ocean...)                                                                                           Tavern Keeper: Can I help you?                                                                      Orion: *Turning around* Hmm? Oh, hi there. Are you the one running this joint?                      Tavern Keeper: For the next 45 minutes or so until I clock out, yes, I am. What do you need?        Orion: You see, I'm on the lookout for some new crew members for a quick but crucial trip overseas. Is there anyone here interested in a gig like that? BIG reward.                                     Tavern Keeper: HAH! Big reward, you said? Who isn't looking for a job like that around here? Almost everyone in this server is chasing that paper, boy. If you've got the coin, you'll find folks here  ready to jump on your ship.                                                                         Orion: Excellent then! Mind spreading the word around? I'm gonna be back in about... 3 hours.       Tavern Keeper: Sure thing. I'll let these bastards know. Huh, it would actually be doing me a solid if you could take some of the ones who are broke as a joke!                                         Orion: *Chuckles* I bet.                                                                            Tavern Keeper: You'll probably have a crew of the less fortunate ready to roll by the time you're   back.                                                                                               Orion: Sounds good to me.                                                                           Tavern Keeper: So... anything else?                                                                 Orion: Yes, actually. I'm looking for Gypsy Goldtooth. I heard he hangs around here. Any idea where I can find him?                                                                                     Tavern Keeper: Oh... sure, he's got the place next to the tavern rented. I can send someone to let  him know you're looking for him.                                                                    Orion: That would be perfect. Thank you for all your help.                                          Tavern Keeper: Although... what's the deal with him? If you're planning to kick up a fuss, do it    outside my tavern.                                                                                  Orion: No worries, nothing like that. He's just got a map I need.                                   Tavern Keeper: A map to... where exactly?                                                           Orion: The Island of the Lost Souls.                                                                Tavern Keeper: Hahahahahaha!                                                                        Orion: What's so funny...?                                                                          Tavern Keeper: Is that why you're recruiting crew members? To sail to the Island of the Lost Souls? That might thin out the applicant pool, you know.                                                   Orion: What? Why?                                                                                   Tavern Keeper: It isn't called “The Island of the Lost Souls” because it's full of Golden Retrievers and hammocks for sunbathing, boy. I've seen countless ships head there for the Heart of the Abyss, and not a single one has ever come back. Sailing there is basically a one-way ticket to the         afterlife.                                                                                          Orion: Well, none of them were me.                                                                  Tavern Keeper: Hahahahahaha! *Laughs* I like your spirit. I'll raise a glass to your health when the ocean spits out the remains of your ship on Tortuga's shores.                                      Orion: Thanks for the motivation...                                                                 Tavern Keeper: Anyway, grab a seat. Goldtooth will be here in a minute.                             Orion: Thanks. *Sitting down* (Jeez, he made it sound like it's a death sentence. Now it's starting to make sense why El Coyote is willing to trade this Heart of the Abyss for a Gem of Doom. The      remains of our ship on Tortuga's shore... this guy doesn't know who he's talking to.)               Pirate: I'm telling you, that server is complete chaos.                                             Orion: Hmm?                                                                                         Pirate: I even heard Ulysses might tighten access soon.                                             Pirate: Andromeda? Is it really that bad?                                                           Pirate: Yeah, my wife's friend and her entire family got murdered in Zyrion-3 the other day when the horde attacked a combat-free zone. Those aliens are going way out of control.                      Pirate: The Xenomorphs are like a plague. They're spreading like a virus, wiping out everything in  their path.                                                                                         Pirate: I heard a rumor that the Chinese cooked them up to mess with Ulysses' monopoly.             Pirate: OF COURSE THEY DID! And yet, ain't nobody doing a damn thing to stop it!                    Pirate: They say Doctor Mercer is diving into researching them. She set up a hospital for the       infected and claims she'll put an end to the plague. Word is, she's even planning to use them to    develop a regeneration serum in the real world.                                                     Pirate: That sounds like some sketchy shit, though – you won't see me volunteering. I've watched    enough apocalypse movies that kick off exactly like that.                                           Pirate: They say Commander Hasler is on a mission to wipe them out. He took over as the new leader  of the Galactic Union, and the word is, they've already taken down thousands of those disgusting    creatures.                                                                                          Pirate: Eh, I’d steer clear of him, though. His methods are... questionable. Rumor has it, he shoots anyone suspected of being infected everywhere he goes, like a full-on witch hunt.                  Orion: (Hmm... seems like the things I went through with Annie were just the tip of the iceberg. A  plague in Andromeda...? Maybe it's best to steer clear of that server for now.)                     Pirate: Huh, and that's not even the worst of it! Have you heard about the rogue NPCs in Ekabar?    They're straight-up murdering real players! And I'm not talking about monsters, I mean regular      farmers and villagers!                                                                              Pirate: Man, Eternum's really going to shit... All these fucking kids are ruining it!               Pirate: It's those damn hackers, I tell ya. Fucking up everything with their boosted weapons. Nobody gives a shit about roleplaying anymore, it's all about who's packing the biggest damn gun.         Pirate: MAKE ETERNUM GREAT AGAIN! We need a new CEO! The Founder's an old fart who doesn't even know or care about what's going down in his own game.                                                   Pirate: Yeah, you're right... we need someone else to get the Gems of Doom pronto and kick that dude out of his fancy golden chair.                                                                     Pirate: But Thanatos is dragging his feet. How many Gems does he have again? 4 or 5?                Pirate: Oh, and what about that new guy working with the WRE? People are saying he's a real         powerhouse.                                                                                         Orion: *Leaning towards the three men's table* Hmmmm...?                                            Pirate: Oh yeah, I've heard about him... people say he has two or three Gems of Doom. But ain't he  just a kid?                                                                                         Pirate: I don't know, kid or not, he's got some balls. There’s a rumor he almost defeated Jasticus  the Decapitator in the Rotunda.                                                                     Orion: (Damn you, Jasticus...)                                                                      Pirate: There’s a rumor he knocked down Jasticus the Decapitator in the Rotunda with just one hit.  Orion: (Yep, that was me.)                                                                          Pirate: Yeah, and they also say he swiped Wagner's Gem even before Thanatos rolled in and wiped the entire server out.                                                                                  Orion: (He didn't even see it coming.)                                                              Pirate: And wasn't he the one who won this year's Triwizard Tournament at Warthogs?                 Orion: (You bet I did. Eh... well, technically not, but... almost.)                                 Pirate: Think he's got a shot against Thanatos?                                                     Pirate: Well, folks who've seen him scrap swear he moves like a damn shadow and hits like a bullet  to the gut.                                                                                         Orion: (Heh, you got that right, old man.)                                                          Pirate: There's not much info about who he really is, not even his name, but... People call him...  The Zigzagopopolis.                                                                                 Orion: *Standing up* WHAT?!                                                                         Pirate: . . .                                                                                       Orion: (Oh wait... it is The Zigzagopopolis. Why the fuck did I choose such a stupid name...? Was I drunk that day?) *Clears throat* I-I mean... I'm pretty sure people call him... Nobody.             Pirate: Ohh... yeah, now that you mention it, that's the name I heard. My bad, got it mixed up with a show my grandson watches.                                                                         Pirate: Do you know Nobody, kid? You seem pretty worked up about him.                               Orion: Well... I've heard the stories too. You could say I'm a... fan. People say he's near         invincible. That he could take down Thanatos if they ever faced off again.                          Pirate: Again? They've already fought?                                                              Orion: They have, actually. Thanatos snagged the win, but it was back when he was still a greenhorn. He won't go down like that again. Or... *clears throat* yeah, so they say. Anyway, I better go     outside now. I need to find Gypsy Goldtooth. Sorry to bother you, gentlemen.                        Pirate: Ugh, I can't stand that guy.                                                                Orion: Goldtooth?                                                                                   Pirate: Yeah, watch yourself with him. He's gonna peddle a load of crap, and only like 1 in 10 items actually works. So you gotta either be real damn lucky or real smart.                              Orion: *Chuckles* Yeah, I've run into sellers like him before. I once– Hold on... How often does he show up around here?                                                                                Pirate: Um... not much. I think he's got other joints in other servers.                             Orion: Oh no.                                                                                       Pirate: Sometimes his assistant swings by too.                                                      Orion: OH NO.                                                                                       Pirate: What?                                                                                       Orion: Please, for the love of everything, tell me Gypsy Goldtooth isn't a tanned, five-foot-one    Asian with poor English.                                                                            Pirate: Eh...                                                                                       Chop-Chop: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHH!!!!!                                                             Orion: I must be dreaming...                                                                        Chop-Chop: No wet-dream here, only best prices! Only best quality!

Orion: Of course...                                                                                 Chop-Chop: OOOOOOHH...

Orion: Um... thank you. In case that was a compliment.                                              Wenlin: *Gasps* Oh, it's Orion! Good to see you back!                                               Orion: Oh, hey Wenlin! Almost didn't recognize you without your little fairy look. Still tagging    along with this crazy old man, huh?                                                                 Wenlin: Absolutely! Gotta stick to the Sensei's path. No riches for those who slack!                Pirate: HEY, THERE YOU ARE!

Chop-Chop: *Whispering* Uh-oh, little weenie man is back. Cannot have him scare best client Orion.  Wenlin: *Whispering* Do you want me to handle it?                                                   Chop-Chop: *Whispering* No, no, your tongue is not sharp enough yet, young niece Wenlin.            *Whispering* I lay down law with tiny meat-man, you go with best client Orion to balcony and start  business. *Whispering* I be back in minute.                                                         Wenlin: *Whispering* Gotcha.                                                                        Chop-Chop: OOOOOOOOOOOHOHOHO best client Pete welcome back!

Pirate: Cut the crap!                                                                               Wenlin: Please, come with me, Orion!                                                                Orion: *Chuckles* Gypsy Goldtooth, really?                                                          Wenlin: Indeed! He goes by different names depending on where we're selling our products. In The New World server, he's Gypsy Goldtooth; in Meiyo, he's Bonsai Shearer, and in Andromeda, he's Quantum  Quasar Starlord!                                                                                    Orion: Oh god, thanks for the warning... I'll try to remember those names.                          Wenlin: Please, follow me! Let's get down to business!                                              Orion: Um... well, alright, I guess I have 5 minutes. But not more than that. Lead the way.         You trail behind Wenlin as she leads the way to the balcony on the second floor of the bustling     tavern.                                                                                             Wenlin: Give me a sec! I'll go get the merchandise ready!                                           Orion: S-Seriously though, there's no need! I've got a shopping list as short as my attention span! Wenlin: Okay, ready! What's on your shopping list today?!                                           Orion: Just one thing. You see, I need to reach the the Island of the Lost S–                       Wenlin: Rum barrels, 50% off just today!                                                            Orion: Really, I just–                                                                              Wenlin: We've also got mimic chests, sunscreen that turns you invisible, and fire swords that are   all sizzle, no burn!                                                                                Orion: *Sighs* I don't– Is that why your palm is all red...?                                        Chop-Chop: *Jumping in* I'M BACK! YOU MISS ME AS MUCH AS I MISS YOU?? HAH! Trick question.          IMPOSSIBLE! No one miss Orion as much as Chop-Chop miss Orion!                                      Orion: Oh no, what's all that shit you're carrying...                                               Chop-Chop: Now listen me here, I have bestest product saved SPECIALLY for you! Top customer! You    find nothing like this anywhere else!                                                               Orion: Okay guys, I appreciate the enthusiasm, but today I only need one thing.                     Chop-Chop: BEHOLD! Scimitar of Destiny, wielded by Blackbeard himself! Not like butter knife from   other sellers – this here REAL DEAL!                                                                Orion: Please, I'm in a rush. I just need a map to–                                                 Chop-Chop: Magic jam of pig princess from distant kingdom! Moist and juicy, can feed even most fat  white woman for weeks!                                                                              Orion: Are you even listening to me?!                                                               Chop-Chop: Oh, need new companion?! Shoulder parrot Maurice is best–                                Orion: ENOUGH!!!! I was told to come here to get a map to the Island of the Lost Souls! I'm on a    quest for The Heart of the Abyss, and I need to get to that island before tomorrow's sunrise! I     don't want princess jam, I don't want weird, giant penis-looking creatures, and I don't want any    other fucking pieces of junk! So, do you have the map or not?!                                      Wenlin: . . .                                                                                       Chop-Chop: . . .                                                                                    Orion: And that's not even a parrot, it's a pigeon!                                                 Wenlin: . . .                                                                                       Chop-Chop: . . .                                                                                    Orion: . . . Um... S-Sorry, I didn't mean to shout. Got a little carried away.                      Chop-Chop: See, little niece Wenlin? Orion mad because I neglect him for too long and he starving   from lack of good product! Lucky for him, he can never stray too far from Chop-Chop's loving        embrace! And we have map JUST for him!                                                              Wenlin: Yeah, we've been selling those like hotcakes this month, actually! A lot of people wanted to get the Heart of the Abyss.                                                                        Chop-Chop: Orion is VIP customer, so we gotta show him only the most trending products! I come back quick with something he'll really like!                                                             Wenlin: And I'll hand him the map in the meantime!                                                  Chop-Chop disappears through the balcony doors as Wenlin frantically starts rummaging behind the    barrels.                                                                                            Wenlin: Alright, let me figure out where we stashed those... I hope we didn't sell'em all... isn't  today the last shot at that Island thing?                                                           Orion: Yeah, that's why I'm in a hurry.                                                             Wenlin: Ah! That makes sense... Aha! Found it! *Unrolling the scroll* You're lucky, it was the last one! And because you're in the VIP club, I'll cut you a deal – this one's on the house! You can also consider this a little apology for taking up your precious time.                                   Orion: Oh, really? Thanks a bunch!                                                                  Wenlin: That said... do you need a quick rundown on how to hit up the Island of the Lost Souls?     Special insider info for just 50 eternals!                                                          Orion: Insider info, uh...?                                                                         Accept                                                                                              Orion: Seems fair, alright. Done.                                                                   Just the map                                                                                        Orion: Thank you, but I'll stick with just the map.                                                 Wenlin: Ohhh... a hard-nosed negotiator, huh...? Okay, okay... you win! Let's call it a deal at 20  eternals, yes?

Just the map (Insist)                                                                               Orion: Seriously, I appreciate it, but the map is all I need.                                       Wenlin: . . . *Mumbling* Agh! You're such a penny-pincher! FINE, 10 ETERNALS! I can't go any lower  or Chop-Chop will straight-up give me the boot.                                                     Accept                                                                                              Orion: Now that sounds better. Done.                                                                Just the map (Insist again)                                                                         Orion: Just. The. Map.                                                                              Wenlin: . . . I hate you. Take the fucking map and get out of here.                                 Orion: THANK YOU! That's exactly what I've been trying to do this whole time!                       Wenlin: Mmph.                                                                                       Orion: *Unrolling the scroll* (Alright, let's see what we've got here...) Hmmm...  (We have to go   through the Icebergs of Frostbone... Siren's Cove... the Bay of the Undead... and then tackle the   Paradox Archipelago. Damn, seems like it won't be as smooth sailing as I hoped. But at least now we know where to go.)                                                                                  Chop-Chop: Ah, you found your map I see!                                                            Orion: Yep! And that was ALL I needed!                                                              Wenlin: *Passing you the map* Excellent! Now pay attention and take note, you bloody penny-pincher. *Passing you the map* Excellent! Now pay attention and take note! Do you see this island in the top left corner? *Pointing at the map* Here?                                                            Orion: I do.                                                                                        Wenlin: That's Tortuga. *Clears throat* Now, if you want to snag that treasure in one piece, you    better pay attention now! It's not as easy as just sailing in a straight line.                      Orion: I'm all ears.                                                                                Wenlin: First, you set sail south until you spot the colossal Icebergs of Frostbone.                Orion: Gotcha. (I better tell the girls to grab some warm clothes.)                                 Wenlin: Next, veer east for a good 40 miles, steering clear of the killer whale that patrols those  waters! Watch out, that sea giant ain't too keen on ships invading his turf!                        Orion: Avoid the killer whale, noted.                                                               Wenlin: Then, head north until you're skirting the coast of Siren's Cove... but be on your toes!    That's mermaid territory! Hope you can resist the siren song and not end up spellbound by their     melody...                                                                                           Orion: Yeah... (It'll probably be easier if I ask them to tie me to the mast.)                      Wenlin: After that, catch Serenity's current to turbocharge your ship until you hit the Bay of the  Undead.                                                                                             Orion: That doesn't sound good...                                                                   Wenlin: It isn't! Better watch your step there, unless you fancy spending eternity swabbing decks on Davy Jones' ship... And last but not least... go north again to enter the Paradox Archipelago!     Sailors have practically gone bonkers trying to navigate its intricate waters! Watch out, not       everything is as straightforward as it seems... Some of them have even claimed to appear back in    Tortuga somehow!                                                                                    Orion: Oh... we don't want that.                                                                    Wenlin: Definitely not! So, if by some miracle, you navigate all these perils and come out in one   piece... you'll finally see it! The Island of the Lost Souls! And the Heart of the Abyss right there for you to take it! Congrats, you made it! Easy peasy!                                             Orion: W-Wait, and what about this sketch of a fucking massive crab-like monster?                   Wenlin: Oh. Yes. The Kraken. Hehe, almost slipped my mind, sorry. You better watch out, he's always on high alert to defend the Heart of the Abyss from trespassers!                                    Orion: *Gulps* Ah, of course. Sounds... like a stroll in the park.                                  Wenlin: And that's all! To set sail, point your ship south and dive into the adventure!             Orion: Mm-hm...                                                                                     Chop-Chop: Ah, nice explanation niece Wenlin, yes!                                                  Orion: Okay! That was ALL I needed! So don't even try to sell me anything else! Maybe next time!    Thank you and have a good one!                                                                      Chop-Chop: WAIT! Before you leave, Chop-Chop save best for last!                                    Orion: What now?!                                                                                   Chop-Chop: Chop-Chop always make wildest dreams come true! Polyjuice potion!                        Orion: Eh...? Oh shit, it's true! Last time you told me you were producing a new batch! I had almost forgotten about it. Oh... okay, I gotta admit, that could come in handy.                           Chop-Chop: Can't be detected by fancy magic gadgets! Just drink and... BING BONG KABLOM! Instant    change!

(An    item this powerful is bound to come in handy someday, no doubt. And who knows when I'll cross paths with Chop-Chop again. This might be my one shot.) This thing doesn't have an expiration date,       right?                                                                                              Chop-Chop: No need for the fridge, my friend! If it smell funky and looks chunky, that means it will work!                                                                                              Orion: Hmph. Alright, fine, hand me a bottle. It better do what it says! Otherwise, I'll personally kill you!                                                                                           Don't buy it                                                                                        Orion: Ehh... yeah, not today, sorry.                                                               Chop-Chop: Excellent purchase, excellent! You won't regret, congratulation!                         Orion: I've gotta save the cash for something else. But stash one bottle away! I'll grab it next    time, I promise.                                                                                    Chop-Chop: Alrighty, we keep a potion for you in Chop-Chop's stash, just in case... ONLY because you best friend! Come back here when you have more JINGLE-JANGLE in pocket!                            Orion: Thank you, I appreciate it. (I really do hope I don't regret this decision later.) Anyway,   for real now, time for me to hit the road. (Nova's probably wondering why I'm taking so damn        long...) Thanks for the map and take care!                                                          Chop-Chop: Thank you friend!

Orion: (Oh god, why do I always leave Chop-Chop's with a headache...? I can still hear his          ear-piercing voice in my head...)

Chop-Chop: MY HEART MISS YOU SO MUCH ALREADY!                                                       Wenlin: Farewell, Orion! Come back soon with lots of gold!                                          Orion: *Waving* Haha okay, okay! I'll try my best! Goodbye, guys! *Chuckles* (Those two are         something else.)                                                                                    Wenlin: Say hi to your hot girls from me! And best of luck on your mission!                         Chop-Chop: Keep moving forward, Orion! That is the only way.                                        Orion: (Okay, time to head back and–) . . . *Turning around* What did you just sa– (Oh... they      already left. For a moment, he didn't sound like the usual Chop-Chop. I could swear I've heard that before... Anyway, time to head back. I can't waste any more time. Still have to grab lunch with     Nova, come back to Tortuga, assemble a new crew, and set sail for the Island of the Lost Souls.     Still have to grab lunch, come back, assemble a new crew, and set sail for the Island of the Lost   Souls. No time to waste!) *Sitting up* (Oh man, it's not until you log off that you realize how     hungry you actually are... I'd KILL for a pizza. Mmh, but it's still raining. Maybe it'd be quicker if I just grab them myself. The delivery guy's gonna take forever. Hmm... Actually... if I cut      through Chinatown for a shortcut, I can be back here in 30 minutes. Easy. And I could grab one for  Nancy as well. Alright, sounds like a plan! I'll leave without telling her and surprise her with the pizza when I'm back. What can I say, I'm a hopeless romantic...) *Sitting up* (Oh man, it's not    until you log off that you realize how hungry you actually are... I'd kill for those pizzas. Mmh,   but it's still raining. Maybe it'd be faster if I just go grab them myself. The delivery guy is     gonna take forever. Let's check with Nova, perhaps we could make it a joint adventure.)             Sandra: Honey! I thought you'd be playing!                                                          Orion: (Oh, is her mom still here?)                                                                 Sandra: Nova?                                                                                       Nova: . . .                                                                                         Sandra: Nova!                                                                                       Nova: Hmm...? Oh, sorry, Mom. Just got lost in my thoughts for a sec.                               Sandra: Aren't you wearing the Eternum suit? I thought you were planning to play together.          Nova: Oh, yeah, we are. I just took it off to grab a quick bite while we have a break.              Sandra: Oh, I see! Well, enjoy then, you two!                                                       Nova: Thanks, we will. What about you, though? Weren't you going out with Dad?                      Sandra: Yeah, but your father forgot the tickets, so we had to come back. *Chuckles* I swear, he's  becoming increasingly forgetful!                                                                    Nova: Ah, I see.                                                                                    Sandra: Don't worry though, I'm heading out again now! Have fun with Orion!                         Nova: Okay, Mom.                                                                                    Sandra: *Whispering* And promise me you'll use protection if you... you know.                       Nova: Yes, Mo– Oh my god, c-can you stop with the awkward sex talk already?? I'm not 15 years old,  you know?! And didn't I tell you Orion and I are just friends?! Stop making it weird, for Christ's  sake!                                                                                               Sandra: Oh... I'm sorry, sweetie, I didn't... Did something happen?                                 Nova: Nothing happened.                                                                             Sandra: I just... I thought you liked that boy, I'm sorry.                                          Nova: Who gives a shit about what I like or not. That's not... important. Never has been. I'm       just... I'm just the clumsy, quirky, ginger friend people call when they need something and then... forget about.                                                                                       Sandra: . . . Do you want me to stay? I'll go tell your dad to cancel our plans.                    Nova: No. Please, go.                                                                               Sandra: Are you sure? It's no trouble, really.                                                      Nova: Yes, I'm sure. We're logging back into Eternum in like 10 minutes anyway. We have something   important to tackle there.                                                                          Sandra: . . . Alright then... We won't take long anyway, just a couple of hours at most.            Nova: Okay.                                                                                         Sandra: . . . Okay, take care, honey. I love you.                                                   Nova: Love you too.                                                                                 Nova waits and stays quiet until she finally hears her mom heading downstairs and leaving through   the front door.                                                                                     Nova: *Sighs* Agh... I hate this weather.                                                           Nova steps into the guest bedroom, her gaze fixed on the floor.                                     Nova: *Turning around* Oh s-shit! W-Why are you standing here like a psychopath?! I thought you were still connected! You scared me!                                                                    Orion: Sorry, I just logged off.                                                                    Nova: Anyway, listen, about that lunch... I know we were planning on pizza, but the delivery guy's  gonna take a while because of the rain, and we gotta get back to The New World, like, now. So I     thought we could just snag something from the fridge. Is that cool with you? I've got some Mac and  Cheese leftovers from yesterday and some tacos from Luna's cafe from... Thursday, I think?          Wednesday...?                                                                                       Prove to her you care about her                                                                     You swiftly grab Nova's waist and draw her in, your touch sparking a rapid blush across her cheeks  almost immediately. I'm craving for pizza                                                           Nova: Or... maybe Tuesday.                                                                          Orion: Um... (It's probably best if I don't mention that I overheard her chat with her mom. I'd come off as nosy, and she'd be embarrassed.) Uh... I'm honestly craving pizza.                          Nova: Oh... Fair enough.                                                                            Orion: But I don't mind running out to get it myself! A little rain won't stop me. I'll cut through Chinatown for a shortcut. I can be back here in... 20 minutes.                                      Nova: Oh well, in that case... sure, okay then. I'll take a quick shower while you're out, so we can hop on Eternum faster later.                                                                       Orion: Sounds good!                                                                                 Nova: Just make sure you grab an umbrella.                                                          Orion: I will! What kind of pizza do you want?                                                      Nova: Anything's fine. Just... thick crust. If possible. And thank you for going!                   Orion: No problem! (Hmm, maybe it's just my imagination, but she sounds a bit down. I should plan   another anime date next week to make it up to her. If she's still up for it, that is. You never know with women... But anyway, let's go grab the food! I wonder if I can polish off a whole extra-large pizza by myself...)                                                                                 Nova: W-What's going on with you now...? We really have no time to waste...                         Orion: No, we don't. And that's precisely why I want to dedicate the next few hours entirely to you, Nova.                                                                                              Nova: We need to get that treasure for El Coyote.                                                   Orion: We have time. Actually... even if we didn't, I don't give a fuck. Right now, you're the only thing on my mind, Nova. The only one deserving of attention. I'm sorry I haven't shown you enough   how much you really mean to me.                                                                     Nova: W-What's gotten into you all of a sudden?                                                     Orion: Today was our date. Everything else can wait.                                                Nova: Mmh...?                                                                                       Orion: I just want to prove to you that you're much more than my clumsy, quirky, ginger friend.     Nova: Ohh... y-you heard that. Um... T-This is a bit embarrassing. What I meant is that I–          You gently tug Nova closer, making your lips meet in a tender kiss.                                 Nova: . . . Mmh?                                                                                    After a brief moment of hesitation, Nova leans into you and reciprocates the kiss with an energetic passion that lingers for several seconds.                                                           Nova: *Moaning* MMMmmmmmmmh...                                                                      Orion: (Damn, her soft, fleshy lips feel like pure magic... I could kiss her for hours without      getting tired.)                                                                                     Nova: MMMMmmmm... *Breaking away from the kiss and easing onto the bed* W-Wow. W-Where did that come from...?                                                                                           Orion: Just something we should've done a long time ago. I mean, can you believe this was actually  our first kiss? After everything we've done together?                                               Nova: Was it...? Are you sure? N-Never really thought about it, but... now that you mention it...   Orion: *Chuckles* Come on, stop! We've moved past that already! You definitely know that was our    first kiss.                                                                                         Nova: *Giggles* Okay, okay... I know it was. And... it felt... as perfect as I had hoped.           Orion: I felt the same way.                                                                         Nova: I-I'm glad.                                                                                   Orion: Tell me then, is there anything else you've been hoping for...?                              Nova: Well... if we actually do have some time to spare before going back to The New World... W-We  could... cuddle for a bit. Maybe kiss a little bit more...                                          Orion: Ah, I couldn't have thought of a better idea myself. Do you mind if I take off the E-suit?   Nova: Not at all.                                                                                   You take off the top part of the E-suit as Nova gives you a surreptitious onceover, a playful smirk gracing her lips.                                                                                   Orion: (Man, I'm already hard as a rock and she’s barely touched me. And her sexy look isn't making it any easier...) *Lifting her head* Fuck... I want you so bad, Nova. I want us to be way more than friends. And I think we've danced around it long enough... don't you think?                         Nova: Mm-hm...                                                                                      Orion: There’s no pretense this time. No external interferences. No crazy chicks with guns,         aphrodisiacs, or bizarre duplicating artifacts. No more excuses. Now, it's just me... longing for   you.                                                                                                Nova: Mmmhh...                                                                                      Orion: Don’t you want me too?                                                                       Nova: I do... And I don't think I can hold out much longer before going completely insane...        Orion: Oh, my poor Nova... I'm gonna give you everything you're craving... and more...              Nova: Please... I want it so bad... I want to... take things to the next level with you. I want... I want you to be the one.                                                                            Orion: (FINALLY she's shedding all that nervousness and speaking her mind clearly...) Oh Nova...    There's literally nothing else I want more in this world right now.                                 Nova: *Purring* Mmmmmmh...                                                                          Orion: *Teasingly* Wait... we're still talking about cuddling, right?                               Nova: *Giggles* Mhhmm. Of course... I need you to cuddle me hard...                                 Orion: Oh boy... *Sitting next to her* Why don't you take those shorts off too? Consider it my only request for the night. I'm just itching to see that perfect round butt of yours again.              Nova: Uh... *Giggles* Well, if you insist... *Standing up* I haven't been hitting the gym in a      while, so... my butt might not be at its peak.                                                      Orion: I'm sure it's still just as– ...good. Jesus Christ, Nova... You only brought up the training bit because you wanted me to swoon over how flawlessly perfect your butt was, didn't you?           Nova: *Giggles* Perhaps.                                                                            Orion: Not to mention those panties look sexy as fuck on you...                                     Nova: *Giggles* Do you like them?                                                                   Orion: Hell yeah...                                                                                 Nova: Anything else you like...?                                                                    Orion: Well, we can start talking about that sexy, toned tummy of yo–                               Stirred by the shower of compliments, Nova enthusiastically leaps onto you, initiating another      passionate kiss.                                                                                    Orion: *Kissing her back* (God... her fragrance is intoxicating...)                                 Nova: MMMMmmmmm...                                                                                  Orion: *Groping her butt* (I can't get enough of her body... She's like pure energy, a mischievous  little devil tempting me...)                                                                        Nova: Mmmmmm...                                                                                     Orion: (But I need to take it slow... Nova's first time has to be special. Given her moans and      reactions, she's probably fantasized about this even more eagerly than I have... I can't ruin it    now.)                                                                                               Nova: MMMmmmmmmm... *Interrupting the kiss* C-Can I... *Whispering* Can I touch it...?              Orion: *Whispering* Touch it...? (Or maybe there's no need to be that gentle with her after all...) *Whispering* Fuck yes, you can...                                                                   Nova: *Whispering* Oh my god... *Whispering* You're so... hard... *Whispering* I-Is that all for me?Orion: You know it is...                                                                            Nova pulls your pants down and proceeds to jerk you off, as her lips close around yours once more.  Nova: MMmmmmmmMMmm...                                                                               Orion: (Oh my god, her fingers are curled so tightly around my dick... She’s so soft... And the best part is that I didn't even have to prompt her or guide her into it.)                               Nova: *Moaning in between breaths* AAaahhh...                                                       Orion: (There’s a hint of nervousness behind each of her movements, but her fierce passion shines   through. This feels too damn good...)                                                               Nova: Mmmmmhh...                                                                                    Orion: (I wanna make her mine...)                                                                   Nova: *Leaning over your lap* MMmmmmmhh...                                                          Orion: Oh fuck yes... I've missed your touch so much, Nova...                                       Nova: Me too... I wanna... taste you again...                                                       Orion: *Pulling her panties down* Were you left yearning for more after the last time you sucked my cock, you naughty girl?                                                                             Nova: *Giggles* Maybe...                                                                            Orion: It's all yours then...                                                                       Without thinking twice, Nova wraps her fleshy lips around your member and starts sucking your dick  with fervor. Her slurpy sounds fill the air, ceasing only for her brief gasps for air.              Orion: Oooooohhhhh f-fuck yeaaaahhh... That's it babe... (Oh my god, she’s just pouring out drool   from her mouth... I feel like I'm in heaven...)                                                     Nova: *Gagging* MMmmmhhh... mmmhmhhh...                                                             Orion: Nice job...                                                                                  Nova: *Gagging* MmmMmMMmmmhh...                                                                     Nova’s every move makes it clear how much she’s savoring the moment. Her tongue glides              enthusiastically around your cockhead, her desire to please overpowering her.                       Orion: Oh Nova... You're so fucking good at this...                                                 Nova: MMmmmmmh...                                                                                   Orion: (Dear Lord, she barely needs to pause for breath...) Please don't stop...                    Nova: *Gagging* MMmmmm...                                                                           Orion: Don't stop now...                                                                            You suddenly stand up and push Nova onto the bed beside you.                                        Orion: F-Fuck, Nova, I'm about to lose it. No more foreplay... I don’t want any more wasted time.   Let's do it NOW...                                                                                  You spread Nova's legs and get on top of her, slapping your fully erect cock on her tummy with an   enticing “plap.”                                                                                    Orion: I need to be inside of you... I NEED to feel your pussy...                                   Nova: Aahh... Mmmh... I c-can't. S-Sorry. I want to, b-but I can’t.                                 Orion: E-Eh? What? What happened?                                                                   Nova: I... I promised my mom we wouldn't do it without a condom.                                    Orion: W-What? But... I d-didn't bring any. Do you have any here?                                   Nova: N-No.                                                                                         Orion: Then... Shit, p-please don't bail on me now.                                                 Nova: . . .                                                                                         Orion: D-Do you really want to stop?                                                                Nova: . . .                                                                                         Orion: What if... I just make sure to finish outside? Would you want to continue then...?           Nova: . . . . . . *Playfully* Would you tell my mom?                                                Orion: Not even a word...                                                                           Nova: Hmm. Okay then...                                                                             Orion: *Teasingly* Okay, what?                                                                      Nova: Okay... let's do it.                                                                          Orion: Do what?                                                                                     Nova: *Giggles* You know what.                                                                      Orion: Mmmm... not really, no. You'll have to be more explicit. What exactly do you want me to do?  Nova: . . . *Whispering* I want you to fuck me. *Whispering* Now.                                   Orion: Oh, Nova... hearing those words is literally a dream come true.                              You gently place the tip of your dick on Nova's pussy. A soft moan escapes her lips, but her eyes   betray no sense of nervousness. She is ready for you.                                               Nova: Aaah...                                                                                       Orion: You sure about this...?                                                                      Nova: *Whispering* Yes... *Whispering* Put it in...                                                 Orion: Here we go... AAAAaaaaahh...                                                                 Nova: AAAAAAaaaAAAGhh...                                                                            Orion: F-Fuck, you're so tight...                                                                   Nova: *Panting* OH MY GOD. *Panting* OH MY G-GOD, IT'S IN.                                          Orion: It is, at last...                                                                            Nova: It feels so huge...                                                                           Orion: I'm gonna start to move, okay?                                                               Nova: Yes... O-Okay... I'm ready... *Moans* Aaahh... Oh my g-god... OH MY FUCKING GOD.              Orion: Ohhhhh Nova, FINALLY... You have no idea for how long I've been longing for this... how long I’ve been thinking about this...                                                                    Nova: M-Me too... *Panting* I've b-been dreaming about this... f-for ages...                        Orion: Dear Lord, you're too tight...                                                               Nova: *Panting* You're too big...                                                                   Orion: (If she wasn't absolutely soaked right now, I wouldn't even be able to fit the tip in... But fuck me, this feels like heaven...)                                                                 Nova: *Moans* AAAAaaaAAaahh...                                                                      Orion: D-Does it hurt...? L-Let me know if it’s too much...                                         Nova: N-No! It feels... A-A-AaAAagghhh... *Moans* Good...                                           Orion: Good girl...                                                                                 Nova: *Moans* AAAAAaahhh... Oh, Orion...                                                            Orion: Do you like feeling me inside of you? Is it what you hoped for?                              Nova: *Moaning* I f-fucking love it.....                                                            Orion: I don’t believe you... let me check that myself...                                           Nova: *Giggles* Mmmmmmh...                                                                          You lift Nova's shirt up, revealing her erect nipples.                                              Orion: Ah, you weren’t kidding...                                                                   Nova: *Giggles* Mmmh...                                                                             Orion: God, you're so fucking hot. Ready to speed up a bit...?                                      Nova: *Giggles* Mm-hm... AAAAaahhhhh... aaaaahhh...                                                 Orion: *Panting* Oh baby...                                                                         Nova: MMmhh.... mmmmm.... mmmggghh... *Panting* J-Jesus...                                          Orion: Ohh y-yeah...                                                                                Nova: *Panting* Oh Orion... *Panting* From down here you look so... *Panting* So p-powerful... so   strong... *Panting* I can see... all your muscles... *Panting* The veins on your a-arms... you’re   so... unghhh... *Panting* AAAaaAAAaaAaahhhh... *Panting* P-Please, take me... *Panting* Make me     yours...                                                                                            Nova's words, coupled with the sight of your manhood penetrating the petite ginger girl's pale      physique, kindle a fire within you. You renew your thrusts with exuberance.                         Orion: AAahhh... FUCK YES...                                                                        Nova: D-Do you like my body too?                                                                    Orion: I fucking love your body... your skin... your cute face... your tight ass...                 Nova: *Moaning* MMMMmmmmmhh... yeah...                                                              Orion: Your pussy feels like it’s... sucking me in...                                               Nova: *Moaning* Oh Orion... *Moaning* This feels... i-incredible... AAAAAAGGHH..... YES... give it  all to me... Go deeper... G-Go faster...                                                            Orion: Deeper? (I can actually sense her tension easing and her body getting more relaxed... maybe  she's ready for some harder thrusts?) A-Are you sure?                                               Nova: *Panting* I've never been m-more certain of anything... *Panting* Give me every inch...       You finally peel off Nova's shirt and pin her body against the bed.                                 Orion: Now you'll see the real deal...                                                              Nova: *Breathing heavily in anticipation* Yeah... *Breathing heavily in anticipation* Fuck me HARD, Orion... Oh my GOD..... Oh my fucking GODDDDD........                                               You begin thrusting your hips relentlessly against Nova's, your dick hitting the deepest parts of   her with each thrust. Goosebumps appear all over her skin as she adjusts to your new speed.         Orion: OOOOOOooohhh fuuuuuck... (I knew she could take it all... she might be petite, but she's     resilient as a nail.) AAAahh... N-Now we're talking, babe...                                        Nova: *Panting* AAAAAAhhh... AAAHHHHH... AAAAGGGGHHHGHH...                                          Orion: O-Oh sweet heavens, t-this is amazing...                                                     Nova: *Panting* Oh Lord... y-you're gonna break me...                                               Orion: Isn't this what you wanted...? Didn’t you hope I’d f-fuck you like this?                     Nova: *Panting* AAAAAAGgghhh... yeah... Oh my god... Oh my god...... OH MY GODDDDDD......           Orion: *Panting* FUUUUUUCKKK....                                                                    Nova: *Panting* OH GOOD GRACIOUS... *Panting* Aaahhhh... *Panting* I d-d-don't think I can keep up  this pace, Orion...                                                                                 Orion: *Panting* I saw your pussy devouring that dildo, Nova... *Panting* I know you can do this... Nova: *Panting* B-But you're WAY thicker than t-that... *Panting* And w-way more... *Panting*       Intense....                                                                                         Orion: *Panting* Aaaahhh... *Panting* I love how wet you are, even at this speed...                 Nova: *Panting* I'm gonna cum, Orion... *Panting* I can't... *Panting* H-Hold it... *Panting* Any... *Panting* MORE!!!! *Orgasming* AAAAAAAaaghhhhhhhhhgh...                                            You stop as Nova’s thighs wrap tightly around your waist, her shudders and shakes surprising you as she orgasms.                                                                                        Nova: *Orgasming* AAAAAAAaaghhhhhhhhhgh...                                                          Orion: *Panting* Damn...                                                                            Nova: *Giggles* T-This sensation was... indescribable...                                            Orion: Y-Your hips spasmed so hard that I thought you were gonna snap my cock...                    Nova: *Giggles* S-Sorry...                                                                          As though she were a squirrel clinging to a branch, Nova deftly spins on top of you, prompting you  to sit on the bed.                                                                                  Orion: Huh...?                                                                                      Nova: *Recovering her breath* We're not done here yet... *Panting* I need... *Panting* Moreeeee...  *Panting* Oh my goddd...                                                                            Nova starts to bounce on your cock, seemingly immune to fatigue.                                    Orion: Oooohhh Lord...                                                                              Nova: *Moans* AAAaaahh... *Moans* Aaaaaahhhh... it's sp-preading me apart...                        Orion: You're doing just fine... keep going... Ride that cock for all it’s worth...                 The tantalizing view of Nova's petite breasts bouncing right in front of your face propels you into a new realm of heightened sensations and pleasure. Her ceaseless energy awakens something deep      within you, enhancing your own drive.                                                               Orion: M-My god, Nova, yessss... So good...                                                         Nova: *Moans* Yeaahhh...                                                                            Orion: Go faster...                                                                                 Nova: *Moaning* Can I...?                                                                           Orion: How is that even a question...?                                                              Nova: *Giggles* Okay... *Panting* AAAaaaagghhhh... aaaaaahhh... aaaAaaaAAAhh...                     Orion: O-O-Ohh f-fuck...                                                                            Nova: *Moans* Oh my g-god, Orion... AAAAaahhhh...                                                   Orion: D-Does this feel as good as you expected?                                                    Nova: *Moans* It f-feels M-MUCH BETTER... AAAaahhh... aaaghhhh...                                   Orion: Good...                                                                                      Nova: *Panting* I can feel you... deep within... exploring every part of me... *Panting* This       feels... like m-magic... AAAAAHHhhhhhh...                                                           Orion: Ohhh fuck, you're a total addict...                                                          Nova: *Panting* Holy fuck, all that wait was so worth it... *Biting her lip* MMMHhhMMMMmmmhhhh..... Orion: AAaghh...                                                                                    Nova: *Panting* All those awkward talks about sex at school and college where I couldn't join in... *Panting* It was all worth it... just for this moment... *Panting* Oh, Orion...                     Orion: F-Fuck yes... We have to make up for the lost time now...                                    Nova: *Panting* Y-Yes, we have to... *Panting* I want you to f-fuck me... every day...              Orion: And we'll have to hit up another party soon and play the polygraph game with Dolores and     Haskel again, eh? You’ll probably have spicier things to tell this time...                          Nova: *Giggles* YEEESsssss PLEASE!!! AAAAAHHhhhhh... aahaahhh... aaaAAAGGHHhh....                   Nova pushes you down onto the bed, molding her body against yours and taking your dick as deeply    inside her as she can.                                                                              Nova: AAAHHhh... aahhh... aaaghahhhh....                                                            Orion: *Panting* Good grief...                                                                      Nova: *Faint voice* Oh my g-god, Orion, I-I'm gonna cum again...                                    Orion: *Panting* F-Fuck, me too, Nova... *Panting* I'm at my a-absolute limit...                    Nova: *Panting* P-Please, just give me 20 seconds... *Panting* I'm almost there... *Panting* Please d-don't move...                                                                                     Orion: *Panting* Oh god...                                                                          You avert your gaze from the sight of the ginger girl's perfect body, and instead silently implore  the spirits for the strength to endure another 20 seconds.                                          Nova: AAAAAHHhhhhh...                                                                               Orion: *Panting* N-Nova...                                                                          Nova: *Panting* I'm cumming... *Panting* I'M CUMMING! AAAAAAAAAAAGGHHHHHHHH... YEEEESSSS...         Orion: F-FUCK, I CAN'T...                                                                           At the very last second, Nova lets your cock slip out of her pussy, right as you climax.            Orion: *Cumming* AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH... *Cumming* FUUUUUUUUCCKKKK... *Cumming* OOOoooooohhh...         Nova: Whoa...                                                                                       Orion: *Collapsing onto your back* OH MY GOD..... *Breathless* Man... *Breathless* What in the world just happened... *Breathless* I don't even know if I'm still in the same dimension...              You watch Nova as she hops off you and rolls over the bed, purring like a playful cat.              Nova: Oh, Orion... Just... WOW.                                                                     Orion: I take it you enjoyed it...                                                                  Nova: Enjoy...? I enjoy drawing and watching anime, this was... I don't even know what this was.    Orion: *Chuckles* I'm–                                                                              Nova: C-Can we do it again?!                                                                        Orion: *Chuckles* Of course, we... Wait... you mean... now?                                         Nova: *Nods*                                                                                        Orion: Now... like... immediately?                                                                  Nova: *Nods*                                                                                        Orion: Um... I m-mean... I-I'd love to, but I need a little rest. R-Refractory period and all. The  spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and... bruised.                                          Nova: Rest like... for a minute?                                                                    Orion: M-More like...                                                                               Nova: . . .                                                                                         Orion: ...10?                                                                                       Nova: *Sitting up* PERFECT! Right on schedule! Enough time to eat and head back to The New World    later, but also just enough for me to do something I've been itching to try!                        Orion: W-What are you going to do...?                                                               Nova: It's a surprise! Give me 10 minutes! Actually... I already straightened my hair, so... just 5! You stay here and recover!                                                                         Nova bolts out of the room at lightning speed.                                                      Orion: *Lounging back on bed* Holy cow... (This girl is going to be the death of me. She really has unlimited energy... and what's better, she knows how to use it.)                                    Nova: I'm almost finished!                                                                          Orion: Not even a minute has passed!                                                                Nova: There's water and eggs in the fridge if you need them!                                        Orion: O-Okay, thanks! (Oh Jesus, she wants to wring me out like an orange... I mean... not that I'm complaining. I never thought I'd find someone who'd match my energy levels, but damn... And how    tight and wet she is... sheesh. Wars have been fought over less.)                                   Nova: *Closing the door* Done!                                                                      Orion: Oh my gosh, Nova, it hasn't even been 3 minutes... *Turning your head towards her* You can't expect me to... Oh my god. *Standing up* Oh my fucking god...                                       You can feel your body deciding to defiantly ignore any notion of a refractory period, as blood     rushes to your cock.                                                                                Orion: How... Is that a wig?                                                                        Nova: *Giggles* Of course not! But it's not a real dye, just a spray can I bought. The blue color   will wash away the next time I shower.                                                              Orion: Oh fuck, babe, you don’t know how much I’ve wanted this...                                   Nova: I've been wanting to do this since the party when I first wore this cosplay. It's been        lingering in my mind since that day...                                                              Orion: You and me both...                                                                           Nova: Except this time... no alarms will go off if we get too close. *Whispering* This time... we   can touch each other as much as we want...                                                          You effortlessly scoop up Nova by the thighs, lifting her against the wall as if she weighed        nothing.                                                                                            Orion: Fuck yes, we can...                                                                          Nova: *Giggles* You're so strong...                                                                 Orion: You can't even imagine how many times I pictured myself fucking you in your Jinx costume.    Nova: Well... you can make it a reality now. Fuck me right here and right now.                      Orion: Is that what you want, you dirty girl?                                                       Nova: Yeah... I want you to fuck me against this wall just like you fucked Maat that day in front of me... Make me scream like she did... Actually... scratch that. Make me scream louder...            Orion: Oh yeah...                                                                                   You penetrate Nova's warm pussy once more, pressing her against the wall with strong, passionate    thrusts.                                                                                            Nova: AAAAaaahhh...                                                                                 Orion: L-Like this?                                                                                 Nova: *Moans* Yessss... *Moans* Oh, fuckkk... *Moans* Y-You're so deep...                           Orion: Aaaaahhh... I know...                                                                        Nova: *Whines* AAAAaghhh... f-fuck...                                                               Orion: I thought Jinx was a tough one...                                                            Nova: AAAahh... I-I am a tough girl....                                                             Orion: Are you...?                                                                                  Nova: Yeah... and I can... pr-prove it... F-Fuck my pussy, Orion... Make it yours... Do whatever you want to me... *Whispering* I can take it all... *Panting* AAAAHHH.... AAAAGHHhhhh...               Orion: *Panting* Ooooohhhhh...                                                                      Nova: *Panting* AAAAagGGGHHHH... *Panting* J-Just like thisss... *Panting* OOOoooggghhhhh...        aaaAAAAaaHHh.... *Panting* T-This is c-completely surreal... *Panting* OH MY GODDDDD...             Orion: F-Fuck yeah...                                                                               Nova: *Panting* AAAAAAGHHH... YESSSS...                                                             Orion: I r-really hope these walls are thick enough, or the next encounter with your neighbors might get a tad awkward...                                                                               Nova: *Panting* AAAAHHHH...  *Panting* P-PLEASE DON'T STOP...                                       Yielding to the moment, Nova just lets herself go and completely surrenders her body to you, her    sole focus to maintain a tight grip on your neck.                                                   Orion: *Panting* Oh shit... *Panting* I'm g-gonna cum again...                                      Nova: *Panting* AAAAAHHHHH... *Panting* NOT YET, PLEASE...                                          Orion: *Panting* I-I can't stop it...                                                               Nova: *Panting* I'm gonna cum too... *Panting* I'm almost there...                                  Orion: *Panting* I-I have to set you down...                                                        Nova: *Holding onto your neck* NOT YET PLEASE... *Panting* AAAAGH!!!                                Orion: *Panting* Oh, Nova... *Panting* O-Okay, I really have to set you down now... *Panting* I have to s-stop or I'm gonna finish insi–                                                                Nova twirls around you like a fidget spinner, clasping onto you incredibly tightly and forcing you  to lean against the wall.                                                                           Orion: O-O-OHHH FUCKKKKK.....                                                                       Nova: *Squeals* AAAAHHHH.... AAHHH.... AAAAAGGGGHH...                                               Orion: W-W-What the fuck are you doing, Nova...                                                     Nova: *Squeals* F-Fuck yes... *Panting* Oh my god, this is AMAZING....                              Orion: O-Oh s-sweet Jesus....                                                                       Nova: *Squeals* AAaaaahhh...                                                                        Orion: Y-You're fucking crazy...                                                                    Nova: AAAAAAAAGGHHHhhh... P-Please don't let me go, Orion...                                        Orion: I'm not even holding you...                                                                  Nova: *Squeals* AAAAAAAHHHH!!!!                                                                     Nova continues to milk you furiously, letting out a piercing shriek with each forceful collision of your cock against her petite form.                                                                  Nova: AAaaghhh... aaaghhh... aaAAAhhh... AaaggGGhh...                                               Orion: Nova, s-stop... You're gonna make me cum inside...                                           Nova: *Panting* I don't c-c-care anymore... *Panting* I-I want you to f-fill me up...               Orion: B-But you said...                                                                            Nova: *Panting* E-Empty yourself INSIDE of me...                                                    Orion: Oh f-fuck... I-I'm cumming so much...                                                        Nova: *Panting* Yeah... cum inside me... please. Please. Pleaseeeee. I'm cumming... YES. YES. YES.  YES. YES. YES.  YES. YES. YES. YES.  YES. YES. YES. YES. YES.  YES. YES. YES. YES. YES. YES. AHH!   AHH! AHH! AHH! AHH! AHH!  AHH! AHH! AHH! AGHH!  AHH! AHH! AHH! AGHH! AAAGGHHH!!!! AAAAAGH!!         AAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!! AAAAAAAAAAHAAAGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH...... *Finally releasing her tight grip* AAAaaAaaaaggghhh...                                                                Orion: *Panting* Oooooh jeeeezzzz... (God, I feel like I just unloaded 3 gallons of cum inside      her... Even though I came twice in less than 10 minutes...)                                         Nova: *Panting* W-W-Waaawaaa....                                                                    Orion: *Panting* Oh, Nova...                                                                        Nova: *Collapsing to the floor* G-Gggaaaaahhh...                                                    Orion: Oh boy...                                                                                    After having reached climax together, you wobble back to the bed on shaky legs and flop down onto   the blanket, completely drained. Both of you linger in silence for a minute, each grappling to      regain a sense of reality amidst the aftermath.                                                     Orion: Damn... You're a nympho...                                                                   Nova: *Still on the floor, laughing* Hahah, shut up... *Struggling to stand up* Oh jeez, I c-can't  even walk. *Collapsing onto the bed next to you* AAaagh...                                          Orion: How am I supposed to face the world after this?                                              Nova: *Giggles* I don't know.                                                                       Orion: I even lost track of time. I mean, do we still have time to get Coyote's treasure? Or is it  already Monday? I feel like we’ve spent a year fucking.                                             Nova: *Giggles* We've got time!                                                                     Orion: *Sitting up* You're quite the giggler, huh?                                                  Nova: *Giggles* I'm just happy!                                                                     Orion: Damn... You're so beautiful...                                                               Nova: *Giggles* Oh, hush! My hair is a mess.                                                        Orion: Truly! I don't know if it's the light, that messy style, or just your eyes, but... wow.      Nova: Thank you for all of this, Orion. I mean... not just the... you know, which was obviously     MIND-BLOWING. For everything. Thank you for making me feel special.                                 Orion: You are special.                                                                             Nova: I know I can be a bit annoying sometimes, and a bit irrational, and perhaps a smidge          overdramatic too. But somehow, you make me feel good about myself. It's like you care about more    than just what I can do – you care about who I am. And... Please, if this is all just in my head,   don't tell me. I'm happier this way.                                                                Orion: *Chuckles* No, it's not just in your head. I feel the same way. Thank you, Nova. And I also  don't mean just the “you know”, which was obviously W-O-W. For everything. You're awesome. I'm so   glad you became a part of my life.                                                                  Nova: Hmm. Anyway! We should REALLY eat something now! We still gotta go back to The New World and  recover the Heart of the Abyss!                                                                     Orion: Hell yeah! I NEED that pizza!                                                                Nova: Pizza?? Are you still willing to go get it?                                                   Orion: Oh, for sure. A little rain won't stop me. I'll cut through Chinatown for a shortcut. I can  be back here in... 20 minutes.                                                                      Nova: Well... okay then! *Giggles* I'm way too hungry to hold you back. I'm gonna grab a shower in  the meantime.                                                                                       Orion: The rain will be my shower. Just keep a towel out for me for when I'm back, please.          Nova: *Giggles* Will do!                                                                            Orion: Alright then, see you in a bit!                                                              Nova: Mm-hm.                                                                                        Nova crawls towards you and gives you one last, passionate kiss on the lips.                        Nova: Mmmmm... *Running away* Alright, go, go, FAST! I'm super hungry! I'll shower and get          everything ready in the meantime so we can hop back into Eternum SUUUUPER fast!                     Orion: Sounds good!                                                                                 Nova: Oh, and ask them to make mine with extra cheese! Crust EXTRA thicc!                           Orion: *Chuckles* Got it! (Oh man, this girl is truly one of a kind... I'm one lucky bastard.)      *Sighs* (Alright... I better get moving! As has become customary, I've got no time to waste...)     *Glancing at the sky* (Hmmm... seems like the rain's going to give me a break while I go grab those pizzas. After all, I'm having some real luck today! Everything just keeps getting better and        better.)                                                                                            You stroll along the deserted streets of Kredon’s Chinatown district, halting briefly in front of a shop window to gaze at your own reflection.                                                         Orion: Hmm. (My hair's getting pretty long. I should start thinking about getting a haircut soon.   Or... maybe I just let it keep growing and try a different style? I could talk to Penny’s           hairdresser friend. I should put some time aside for it next weekend. And I could go shopping with  Penny for some new clothes too, this shirt's already feeling too snug. Ha, if I keep getting        stronger at this rate, I'll need a whole new wardrobe soon.) *Chuckles* Hmm. (Looking better than   ever, feeling better than ever, acing all my tests at school, and getting laid with girls I used to think I couldn't even smell in my life. Looking better than ever, feeling better than ever, and     acing all my tests at school. Not that many girls yet, but... I'm making progress. You're           speedrunning through life with cheat codes enabled, Orion.) *Strolling casually* (Not to mention how I'm practically a powerhouse in Eternum now. No one stands a chance against me at this point. Not  even Thanatos. If we face each other again, I'll wipe the floor with him...)                        Junkie: Hey bro, you got a smoke...?                                                                Orion: *Turning around* Huh? (Jesus, these two look and smell like shit... I'd heard Chinatown      started to go downhill since Eternum hit the scene, but damn, didn't expect it to be this bad. I    guess this is one of the ugly sides of Eternum that nobody talks about. In Eternum, drugs offer a   temporary escape without lingering health effects, but at a marked-up steep price. The higher cost  of drugs in Eternum often leaves their users strapped for cash... until they realize they can buy   the same drugs in the real world. Except now? They have to deal with all the physical fallout. But  of course, surprise, surprise... the news conveniently forgets to talk about this. As happens with  anything involving Ulysses...)                                                                      Junkie: Yo, didn't you hear me? I asked you if you got a cig.                                       Orion: Eh? Ah, no, I don't have any cigarettes. *Turning around* (Anyway, I'm digressing again.     Let's go grab those pi–)                                                                            Junkie: *Grabbing you by the shoulder* Whoa, whoa, whoa... What's the fuckin' rush? Chill the fuck  out, dude.                                                                                          Orion: Don't. Fucking. Touch me.                                                                    Junkie: Damn... why you gotta be such a dick, bro? *Squeezing your shoulder tight* We're just tryna be cool here... ain't we, JJ?                                                                       Orion: *Sighs* What is this, some pathetic attempt at mugging? Get the hell outta my face.          Junkie: What'd ya just say...?                                                                      Orion: You heard me.                                                                                Junkie: Whoa, look at this... this lil' bitch thinks he's tough.                                    Orion: I won't say it again.                                                                        Junkie: Bro, all I want is a couple of eternals. Can't you spare a little somethin' for us less     fortunate souls? Hand over your stuff and we won't mess you up, aight?                              Orion: (These lowlifes are starting to piss me off...) You don't know who you're talking to, buddy. Junkie: Bein' some rich daddy's boy from uptown ain't gonna save ya here, bro.                      Orion: I don't need a rich daddy. I could squash you like a bug with my bare hands if I wanted. And trust me, I’ve got way better shit to do than waste my money on a couple of fucking junkies who'll  just blow it all on their next fentanyl hit like the fucking human trash they are. So I swear to    god, this is my last warning. Let me go NOW.                                                        Junkie: *Giggles* Hihihi... Yo, did ya hear that, JJ? The kiddo said he can squash us like a bug!   They play Eternum for a few weeks and they think they become big dogs in the real world. You're a   riot, kid... A total riot...                                                                        The mugger attempts to land a quick blow on your face, but you easily react and block the punch with your right hand.                                                                                   Junkie: Huh...?                                                                                     You punch him back.                                                                                 Junkie: D-Dude... w-what the fuck?? He sent you flyin'!                                             Junkie: *Hitting the dumpster in anger* AAAAARRRGHHHH, FUCK!!! You b-broke my nose, you fuckin'     cocksucker!                                                                                         Orion: I warned you more times than I should've, so don't come crying now.                          Junkie: AAAAAggghh... You're fuckin' dead, you hear me?! DEAD!                                      Orion: Do yourself a favor and get the hell out of my town. I don't wanna lay my eyes on your sorry ass ever again. *Turning around* (Anyway, I better hurry up to the pizzeria. I've wasted enough time with this scum. Gotta make sure to tell the girls to stay away from Chinatown, though. This        neighborhood used to be decent when I was a kid, but now it– Eh...?) *Coughing* (What...?)          Junkie: Are you fucking nuts?!!                                                                     Junkie: Didn't you see him fuckin' disrespecting us?!                                               Junkie: You shot him in the fucking stomach!                                                        Junkie: Have you forgotten what happened to Alvarez?? We gotta show 'em who's the boss!             Junkie: F-Fuck, dude... the cops are gonna come! I c-can't go back to the slammer...                Junkie: Then stop crying and start moving your fuckin' ass!                                         Junkie: F-FUCK...                                                                                   The two men hastily flee the scene, sprinting away into the distance.                               Orion: The... stomach...? Oh, f-fuck... *Coughing up blood* F-Fuck.... *Fading out* I c-can't       move... *Fading out* M-Must... agghh.. s-stay awake...                                              As the initial rush of adrenaline begins to ebb, a wave of excruciating pain washes over you,       enveloping your senses entirely.                                                                    Orion: *Bleeding out* AAAAaaaAAARRrraaghh... *Bleeding out* W-What? *Bleeding out* Id-driel...?     Idriel: This was not part of the path, Orion. This wasn't foreseen.                                 Orion: *Bleeding out* You c-Can't be hEre... *Bleeding out* T-This is Not EteRnum...                Idriel: Indeed, it's not. And that's precisely why this will be your demise.                        Orion: *Bleeding out* W-What...?                                                                    Idriel: You became arrogant, Orion. Overconfident. Intoxicated by power. By women. By the pleasures of life. You believed yourself invincible. But you're nothing but a fragile mortal.                 Orion: *Bleeding out* P-Please, heLp mE....                                                         Idriel: I can't help you in this world, Orion. There is no coin here. No reset. No fresh start.     Orion: *Choking on your own blood* HHHhhgGgGGGg...                                                  Idriel: I'm afraid this is your end, Orion. Our end. The end. For all of us.                        Orion: I-I... C-C-cCa...                                                                            . . . . .                                                                                           Idriel: . . . Farewell... Orion.
