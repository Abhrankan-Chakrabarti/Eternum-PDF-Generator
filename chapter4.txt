Orion: *Opens the door* . . . W-What... Uhh... h-hello young lady! (What the hell? This girl looks  way too young to be on this server alone...)                                                        Girl: Are you Orion?                                                                                Orion: . . . ...Y-Yes.                                                                              Girl: I have a letter for you.                                                                      Orion: W-What? For me?                                                                              Girl: Yes.                                                                                          Orion: *Taking the letter* (How did this random kid know where I was? Only the girls in the next    room knew I’d be here. Well, and Chang I guess.) Did Chang send you here to prank me? What’s going  on? There's not even a return address on the envelope. Just this strange... symbol.                 Girl: It is a message from the Syndicate.                                                           Orion: The Syndicate? (That name sounds familiar... but I can't quite remember where I heard it.)   Girl: No matter what, you must NOT open this envelope. You cannot read it yet.                      Orion: What? I thought you said this was a message for me.                                          Girl: It is. But you cannot read it until the proper time. Not yet.                                 Orion: And when am I supposed to...?                                                                Girl: Remember the symbol. It is pivotal.                                                           Orion: This one...?                                                                                 Girl: Yes.                                                                                          Orion: Hmm... If I'm not supposed to open it, then why are you giving me this now? Why not just...  send me the message when...                                                                         Girl: Because it has to be now. Not sooner. Not later. Because we've seen it. Because we've already tried.                                                                                              Orion: Um... You're being too cryptic... I'm not sure I'm following you.                            Girl: Don't open it. Don't read it. You will know when it is the proper time.                       Orion: . . . (This creepy girl... Did Chang and Luna decide to team up to prank me this time?) And  tell me, where...? (What the fuck... Damn, she's quieter than a mouse. I couldn’t even hear her     footsteps running down the stairs. Man, what kind of parents let their daughter play Eternum all    alone? Especially on a server like this... I thought this place would be safe, but after this... I'm not so sure anymore.) *Sitting down* Hmm... (I wonder...) Hmm...                                   Annie: SAY SOMETHING!!! I CAN'T STAND THIS SUSPENSE ANY LONGER! WHO WAS IT? ARE WE GONNA DIE?! ARE  WE ALREADY DEAD?!                                                                                   Orion: No, no! It was just... a little girl.                                                        Alex: A little girl was banging on the door like that...? Was she Micaela's sister or something?    Luna: What did she want?                                                                            Orion: She gave me this letter.                                                                     Dalia: A letter? What does it say?                                                                  Orion: She asked me not to read it. Well, commanded me, really.                                     Alex: Then why did she give it to you? That doesn't make any sense.                                 Orion: I don't know, but she insisted that I not read it yet.                                       Luna: Maybe you shouldn't, then...                                                                  Alex: Why not? What could happen?                                                                   Annie: Don't read it! What if a spooky ghost starts chasing you because of it?!                     Orion: Hmm...                                                                                       Open the letter                                                                                     Orion: Bah, to hell with it. Let's see what this is all about. *Opens the letter* Alright... It's... just a piece of paper with a single line written on it. It says... *Reading slowly* Askion         kataskion lix tetrax damnameneus aision. What the hell does that mean? Has anyone ever heard        anything like this gibberish before?                                                                Nova: I don't know what that was, but it sounded like some kind of code. Maybe it's the beginning of another one of Ulysses' events!                                                                    Don't open the letter                                                                               Orion: Bah, we don't have time for this. And... I don't know, I really feel like I shouldn't open   it. The little girl was insistent.                                                                  Nova: Maybe it's the beginning of another one of Ulysses' events! It wouldn't be the first time I've started a quest with something creepy like this.                                                   Orion: Yeah, maybe... Anyway, let's get back to the issue at hand, girls! We have a Gem of Doom to  steal! And we have less than 2 hours to learn each step of the plan! As soon as the heist begins, at 9:00 PM, we’ll have exactly 60 minutes to steal the Gem AND leave the server – not a minute more.  Dalia: What if we run into setbacks? Heists always have little obstacles and hiccups.               Orion: There can't be any. Everything has to be perfect. It NEEDS to be. Chang’s plan is airtight.  You’ll see. He’s assured me that if everyone sticks to the plan, everything will be fine. And hey,  call me an optimist, but I think so too.                                                            Dalia: You sure?                                                                                    Orion: Trust me, by 10:00 PM we'll all be sitting in a lounge, having a toast to a wonderful,       successful, and beautifully executed heist. We'll pull this off without a hitch! What could possibly go wrong?                                                                                          Dalia: If you say so...                                                                             Orion: Ladies... The Gem Heist... starts... now. Hmmm... (F-Fuck, that hurts...)                    Someone removes a bag from over your head.                                                          ???: Time to wake up, sleepyhead.                                                                   Orion: Hmm...? (Motherfuckers... They beat me up...)                                                ???: *Lighting up a cigar* You know... ...of all the times someone attempted to rob me...           Orion: (Where am I...?)                                                                             Cornelius Garrington: ...this was definitely the worst. It was pathetic, even. I guess this is what happens when you let kids into a server like mine. They think they're in a movie and come to fuck   around. A fucking pain in the ass. Now... save me some time and tell me how many of you there are,  and why you tried to rob me.                                                                        Orion: Fuck you. I'm not telling you shit.                                                          Cornelius Garrington: *Chuckles* So cocky. You remind me of myself when I was young. You're gonna   tell me what I want, boy. Whether you like it or not. Do you think we don't know how to make you    talk? Do you believe I give a single fuck about "Eternum's General Code of Ethics"? I don't. And    neither does Ulysses. They are aware of what happens under the radar on every server, and yet...    they do NOTHING to stop it. That’s why Eternum is better than the real world, boy. Here, we don't   have to fear censorship or punishment. Here, we're not restrained by petty morality or frivolous    legality. Here, there’s only one rule: the big fish eat the little ones. And soon, when I gather all 10 Gems... I'll be its King.                                                                       Orion: What a great speech. Tell me, how much time have you spent practicing monologuing in front of a mirror?                                                                                          Cornelius Garrington: *Chuckles* You're gonna tell me your name. You’re gonna tell me the name of   every single person that came with you. And you're gonna tell me why you tried to rob me with the   most boneheaded plan I’ve ever seen. What was the idea? Poisoning my son to distract me while you   tried to assault the bank? How were you planning to get past the cameras? The magic blockers? The   hundreds of armed guards I have stationed all over the place?                                       Orion: . . .                                                                                        Cornelius Garrington: *Chuckles* I'll take your silence as your answer. You thought you'd got it all worked out, didn't you? And now you're wondering how you got stuck down here. After you give me    their identities, I'll make sure I turn all of your lives, both here and in the real world, into a  living hell. Every last one of you...                                                               Orion: I won't tell you anything, and you're not gonna touch a single hair on any of their heads!   Cornelius Garrington: "Their heads", huh? So there's definitely a group of people...                Orion: . . .                                                                                        Cornelius Garrington: *Laughs* Come on, surrender their identities, and I'll try to be merciful. I  can promise you that.                                                                               Orion: . . .                                                                                        Cornelius Garrington: I know that face. I've seen it before. You're mentally reviewing your pitiful plan, aren't you? Running through it, step-by-step from the very beginning, to figure out where     things went wrong... am I right?                                                                    Orion: . . . .                                                                                      Cashier: (God, this is so boring. Nothing cool ever happens here... But well... at least the pay is good.) *Yawns* (Definitely better than my last job in the real world. But maybe I should start      training and become a bounty hunter in one of those fantasy servers, like...)                       Orion: SLACKING OFF DURING WORKING HOURS?!                                                          Cashier: I'M N-NOT! I'm c-checking the bets at the roulette tables! I'm sorry Mr. Garrington, please don't fire me! What...? Oh... I-I'm sorry, I got confused. Welcome to Garrington's Casino, sir! How may I help you today?                                                                              Orion: I'm sorry for my little joke. It's just that I'm very happy today! I just got married!       Cashier: Oh wow, congratulations!                                                                   Nova: And I'm the lucky bride! I'm sorry girls, he's off the menu!                                  Cashier: Congratulations! And thank you for choosing Garrington's Casino. Might I ask your name,    age, and the reason for your visit?                                                                 Nova: Nina T. Riley. I'm 20.                                                                        Orion: Yanis Sharp, also 20. We're mostly coming to see the performances and have a couple of       drinks, but I might also try my luck at a slot machine.                                             Cashier: Wow, you guys are so young!                                                                Nova: Why should I wait when I know I've found the right man?!                                      Orion: Yeah...                                                                                      Far-fetched story                                                                                   Orion: I'm the son of an Arabian Prince. My father didn't approve of Nina, so we straddled two      camels and ran off together across the desert. As soon as we arrived in Switzerland, we logged into Eternum and headed to the New Vegas server to get married.                                          Cashier: *Awkward chuckle* Uhh... Yeah, of course! May I see your IDs, please?                      Credible story                                                                                      Orion: Nina and I have been friends since we were 4 years old. When we were 15, we started dating – and I immediately knew I’d marry this lady one day. So a year ago, I proposed to her, and she said  yes! Now I'm the happiest man on earth!                                                             Cashier: That's lovely! I'm so happy for you guys. I wish you luck in the casino. May I see your    IDs, please?                                                                                        Stay close to reality                                                                               Orion: I'd been living in another country all my life, but recently I moved to Nina's town. I'll    tell you what, it was love at first sight. The moment I first laid eyes on her, I knew I was going  to marry Nov- n...eh, Nina one day. Her hair, her freckles, her flamboyance, her energy... I fell in love with all of it. Then we went to the New Vegas server and, on an impulse... we got married!    Best decision of my life. By far.                                                                   Cashier: I'm so happy for you guys! And I wish you luck in the casino. May I see your IDs, please?  Nova: . . .                                                                                         Cashier: Guys?                                                                                      Orion: *Clears throat*                                                                              Nova: Oh... OH! Sorry! I got distracted looking at my... husband. What is it?                       Cashier: Your IDs.                                                                                  Nova: Oh, sure! I have them right here!                                                             Penelope: EXCUSE MEEEEE?!                                                                           Security Officer: Please, ma'am, don't shout...                                                     Penelope: Don’t you know who I am?!                                                                 Security Officer: Hmmm...                                                                           Penelope: I can't believe it! I'm out of here. Ugh, I'm going to ruin this place with a single tweet after tonight.                                                                                     Security Officer: I'm sorry, but I can't let you into the VIP area without a VIP pass.              Penelope: This is the first time I've been forced into a situation like this. I’ve never experienced such incompetence! What am I supposed to do? Stay in the poor people area? And sit on these filthy stools? Over my dead body. *Gagging* Ughhh, even the carpet is sticky...                            Security Officer: If you have a second, I can ask the Head Security office.                         Penelope: Really? Oh my gosh, this is SO humiliating. I’m sure YOU’RE used to it, but for someone   like me, this is absolutely EMBARRASSING. *Sighs* You have exactly 1 minute. That’s as long as it’ll take me to draft up this 140-character review on the security at Garrington’s Casino.              Security Officer: Lisa? Do you hear me? I have a problem at access gate 6A of the VIP area.         Cashier: Yeah, I can see you from here, Akim. The entire floor is looking at you right now. The last bouncer that caused a fuss was fired, do you remember?                                             Security Officer: I know, I know! Look, this girl says she's famous or something. She said her name is... "Miss Venus." Can you check that real quickly, please?                                        Cashier: *Sighs* Yeah, give me a minute. I'm sorry guys, we're having a little issue at the VIP     area. It'll only be a moment.                                                                       Nova: No problem! Today, nothing can ruin my mood!                                                  Cashier: Thank you for your understanding. Okay... Miss Venus... ah yeah, she's here, Miss Karen    Venus. More than 3.8 million followers on Twitch. Four million followers on Instagram. She even has a Wikipedia page! Come on Akim, you're supposed to know these things.                               Security Officer: You didn't know either!                                                           Cashier: Yeah, but I'm not the doorman for the VIP area.                                            Security Officer: Okay, okay, thank you Lisa. I'm so sorry for the misunderstanding, ma'am. You can pass through now.                                                                                   Penelope: Hmph. It's about time. You’d better hope that the performances at the VIP area are as good as people say, so that I forget about your ineptitude here.                                        Security Officer: Please enjoy your stay at Garrington's...  *muttering* bitch.                     Cashier: Alright guys, everything seems to be in order. Sorry for the wait, we ask that all of our  members show their IDs as a security measure.                                                       Nova: Of course! That makes sense! Thank you very much!                                             Cashier: Have fun and welcome to Garrington's! (This girl is getting married in her twenties, while I'm still single and almost 34. Why is life so unfair...)                                           Calypso: Wondrous...                                                                                Cashier: Welcome to Garrington's Casino, ma'am! How may I help you today?                           Calypso: If what Mercury said is true, you cannot use magic in this place, and yet you managed to   create small balls of light that never extinguish. Astonishing...                                   Cashier: Um... What...?                                                                             Calypso: The lights...                                                                              Cashier: Yeah... Magic is disabled in all the casino and hotel areas to prevent clients from        cheating, if that's what you mean. Um... Might I ask your name, age, and the reason for your visit, please...?                                                                                          Calypso: Ah, yes. My name is... Carrie... I have come to exchange my currency for tokens of the same value in order to gamble on games of chance. All in the hope of obtaining more tokens so I can     exchange them again into my initial currency on my way back.                                        Cashier: Erm... I'll type in "gambling"... Age?                                                     Calypso: Eighty-four.                                                                               Cashier: . . . (Why do I always get stuck with the weirdos?) *Sighs* Can I see your ID, ma'am?      Calypso: Of course.                                                                                 Cashier: Okay... everything seems to be in order. Thank you and welcome to Garrington's Casino...   Carrie Morgan from Pennsylvania, 27.                                                                Calypso: Thank you.                                                                                 Cashier: (God, this place is in serious decline. If I had an eternal for every time someone...)     Calypso: Excuse me, is there a meditation area? Somewhere quiet where I can concentrate. If it is   reserved for royalty, that is preferable, obviously.                                                Cashier: . . .                                                                                      Nova: Alright, if my info was correct, this is the floor where Bobbie likes to drink his scotch. He should be here anytime now. When you start playing, remember to go all-in on the third hand!        Grab her by the shoulder Focus on the mission                                                       Orion: Very well. I guess we need to try to go unnoticed until then. Go to the recreation room and  make sure the dealer isn't here yet. I'll stick around and kill some time ‘til Bobbie appears. Join me when I sit down next to him, my dear wife.                                                       Nova: Yes! I will keep a low profile until then... my darling husband. Smart! Let's do it!          Orion: Hmmm... (There are cameras everywhere. They have no reason to be suspicious of us, but it'll be better if I pretend that I'm playing. Bobbie still hasn't come down anyway. I hope he appears    soon, though... or else our entire plan will be ruined. I'll act like I'm playing the slot machines in the meantime.) *Sitting down* (Ok, how does this thing work... Holy shit, 10 eternals per spin?! What a rip-off. Hey! I won 20 eternals! Not bad.) Jackpot! My luck is changing! (Okay, that's       enough. I'm leaving with more money than I came in with. I see this as a resounding victory! I think I've lost enough money already... Hmm... Oh shit, that's our man! It's showtime.) Ahhh, man! Can't wait to play some poker! Roulette, blackjack, slot machines... all that shit depends on chance, but not this!                                                                                           Bobbie: If you want to play hold'em, you'll have to go to the third floor or wait another 20        minutes.                                                                                            Orion: Oh really? My wife told me I could play poker games at this table.                           Bobbie: You can, but there's only one game every 3 hours. Personally, I like to come early to save  my seat and get a whisky.                                                                           Orion: Oh, I see. Thanks for letting me know.                                                       Bobbie: Also, did you say "my wife"? Aren't you a little too young for that?                        Orion: I look much younger than I really am. Also, she...                                           Nova: Hello honey!                                                                                  Orion: Hey sweetheart.                                                                              Nova: Are you gonna play poker?                                                                     Orion: Not yet, this gentleman told me that the game doesn't start until 9:30 PM.                   Bobbie: You know, maybe we could ask one of the workers here to deal a quick game for us. If it’s me asking, they'll do it. I have certain... VIP privileges.                                           Orion: Damn, really? You have a VIP pass? What are you doing here, then?                            Bobbie: I like to play with the... normal people. They're a bit easier to... *clears throat*        interact with.                                                                                      Orion: That makes sense. But would they really waste a dealer on just the two of us?                Bobbie: As I said, they will if I'm the one who asks. Watch this. *Whistling* HEY! Dealer, come     here.                                                                                               Luna: How may I help you, sir?                                                                      Bobbie: *Showing his VIP card* I'm Bobbie Briggs, you'll deal a quick hold'em game for us, right    sweetie? It's just me and...                                                                        Orion: Yanis Sharp.                                                                                 Luna: Of course, sir.                                                                               Bobbie: That's what I thought...                                                                    Luna: *Shuffling the cards* How much do you want the big blind to be, gentlemen? *Shuffling the     cards* 100 eternals?                                                                                Bobbie: 100 eternals is fine by me. You?                                                            Orion: Sure, that sounds good.                                                                      Luna: Mr. Sharp will start as the big blind. *Dealing the cards* Good luck.                         Bobbie: I raise. 150 eternals.                                                                      Orion: Uhh... I fold.                                                                               Bobbie: Seriously? Are you one of those pussy players, kid? I don't have all day, you know.         Luna: Mr. Briggs has won the round. *Dealing the cards* Now Mr. Briggs is the big blind.            Bobbie: I raise. 50 eternals.                                                                       Orion: I call.                                                                                      Luna: A 3 on the river.                                                                             Bobbie: I raise 80 eternals.                                                                        Orion: I call!                                                                                      Luna: Flush against a pair of queens. Mr. Briggs wins again.                                        Bobbie: *Laughs* Just a pair? That was a sad move.                                                  Orion: Dammit...                                                                                    Nova: Are you sure you know how to play this?                                                       Orion: Just a few bad draws. Stop worrying so much, Nina.                                           Luna: Third round. *Dealing the cards* Mr. Sharp is the big blind now. Place your bets, gentlemen.  Bobbie: . . . I'm only getting good cards today. You have magic hands, cutie.                       Luna: Thank you.                                                                                    Orion: (Heh, you'd be surprised...)                                                                 Bobbie: I raise. 30 eternals.                                                                       Orion: I call!                                                                                      Luna: *Showing the flop* Make your bets.                                                            Bobbie: I raise. 1500 eternals.                                                                     Orion: W-What? 1500?! I can't risk that large an amount.                                            Bobbie: Seriously? Well, I guess I've won then. That was a quick game.                              Orion: Wait! I wanna raise your bet!                                                                Bobbie: And I wanna be the king of Eternum. You have no money, you're out. That's how it works, kid.Orion: I can offer something else! What do you want?                                                Bobbie: You have nothing that interests me.                                                         Orion: What about my wife? I'll bet one night with her.                                             Nova: Excuse me, what the fuck?                                                                     Orion: Come on, honey... don’t be such a pussy! You have nothing to fear. I'm gonna win this hand,  I'm 100% positive. Statistically speaking, I’m due a good hand.                                     Nova: That’s not how statistics work! We've been married for less than 6 hours and you're already   gambling with ME?!                                                                                  Orion: But I'm gonna win! Don't worry!                                                              Nova: Fuck you!                                                                                     Orion: Babe! Don't get mad!                                                                         Nova: You're fucking hopeless... I should have listened to my mom.                                  Orion: Do you agree, then?                                                                          Nova: Do whatever you want, asshole.                                                                Orion: What do you say, Bobbie? Do we have a deal?                                                  Bobbie: . . .                                                                                       Orion: Come on Nina, turn around. You're gonna miss my victory!                                     Nova: I said FUCK YOU!                                                                              Bobbie: Yeah, I'll accept your... wager.                                                            Orion: Are you gonna bet more, then? I'd say my wife is worth more than just 1500 eternals.         Nova: *Muttering under her breath* You're damn right I'm worth more than 1500 eternals, prick.      Bobbie: I don't have any more cash on hand. I'd have to go all the way up to the cashier, and the   line could take an hour.                                                                            Orion: What about that VIP pass you showed before? I've always wanted to go there.                  Bobbie: The VIP pass? Yeah, sure, if that’s what you want. Alright, here you go. 1630 eternals and a VIP pass. All in. And I’ve got a full house, aces and kings.                                       Orion: Oh shit... I may have made a huge mistake... I’ve got a pair of deuces...                    Bobbie: Hahaha! Goddammit boy, you shouldn't have come here if you didn’t know how to play.         Luna: Alright gentlemen, let's see the last two cards.                                              Bobbie: *Laughs* Yeah, let's follow the protocol.                                                   Luna: A deuce on the turn. And another deuce on the river. Four of a kind. Mr. Sharp wins the hand. Bobbie: . . . Wait, what?! WHAT?!                                                                   Nova: Well played, darling!                                                                         Orion: It was easy. You see, poker's not about playing the odds... it's about playing the man.      Nova: I never doubted you.                                                                          Orion: Well, we have to leave now, thanks for playing with me, Mr. Briggs.                          Luna: Yes, I need to leave too. My shift's over. Thank you for choosing Garrington's Casino.        Bobbie: . . . But... The odds...                                                                    Dealer: Good to see you again, Mr. Briggs. I'll be the dealer for the hold'em game tonight.         Bobbie: What...? What about the girl with the black hair?                                           Dealer: Who?                                                                                        Bobbie: Black hair, red eyes... She was very young.                                                 Dealer: I don't think there's anyone who looks like that working here tonight.                      Bobbie: . . .                                                                                       Nancy: Good evening.                                                                                Bank Employee: Good evening, ma'am. How may I help you?                                             Nancy: I am Katarina Vasiliev. I'm here for the delivery.                                           Bank Employee: The delivery...?                                                                     Nancy: *Sighs* Can I speak with your supervisor? I don’t have time to waste – I’m in a rush.        Bank Employee: Actually... I'm in charge today.                                                     Nancy: Seriously? Then you should have known that I had an appointment.                             Bank Employee: Uhh... Could you please remind me of the reason for your visit?                      Nancy: I've come on behalf of Ivan Antonov, CEO of Flex Energy Systems. We need to secure an        artifact of the utmost importance. Mr. Garrington himself assured us that this was the most secure  vault in all of Eternum.                                                                            Bank Employee: And it is, ma'am. What is this artifact?                                             Nancy: This briefcase. Its content is strictly confidential, so I must take it to the designated    vault myself.                                                                                       Bank Employee: I can assure you our workers are completely trustworthy. They're under constant      surveillance.                                                                                       Nancy: If they were completely trustworthy, there would be no need to keep them under constant      surveillance, would there? Besides, Mr. Antonov insisted that no one touch the briefcase but me. And Garrington agreed. He claimed that everything would be arranged by the time I arrived. *Sighs* You know what, it's probably better to just forget about it. Coming here was a mistake. I knew we should have chosen Blibinar's Bank.                                                                       Bank Employee: No, no! Please ma'am, just give me a minute to confirm your appointment. It's a      simple security measure.                                                                            Nancy: *Sighs* Okay, fine... but hurry up.                                                          Bank Employee: It'll only be a second...                                                            Security Officer: Control room, Security Chief Mendez speaking.                                     Bank Employee: Hi... I'm here with Ms. Vasiliev. She needs to stash an extremely valuable briefcase in the vault, and claims to have arranged everything with Mr. Garrington. Can you confirm that her  appointment was scheduled?                                                                          Security Officer: Yes, we'll check the logs. Camille, can you check if a delivery to the main vault by "Ms. Vasiliev" was scheduled for today? Anything else?                                           Bank Employee: No, that's all for now. Have there been any incidents today?                         Security Officer: No sir. Everything's been running smoothly. Cameras are on, the main vault's      internal temperature and humidity remain stable, and all men are in their scheduled positions.      Bank Employee: Alright, good. What about the appointment? Is everything okay?                       Security Officer: . . .                                                                             Bank Employee: Mendez? Are you there?                                                               Security Officer: Yes, sorry. Uhh... Ms. Vasiliev, yeah, she's here.                                Dalia: The documents were misfiled, so that's probably why they didn't get to you in time. I'm so   sorry for the inconvenience. Mr. Garrington pointed out that this was a very special client.        Bank Employee: Understood. Thank you. All set, Ms. Vasiliev. Please accompany me to the vault. You  may come around to the door on your left.                                                           Nancy: It’s about time...                                                                           Dalia: Alright, I have visuals of every single room of both the bank and casino. Are the            micro-auriculars working? Can you hear me, Saturn? If you can, say: "This place looks worryingly    unprotected."                                                                                       Nancy: This place looks worryingly unprotected.                                                     Dalia: *Giggles* Nice!                                                                              Nancy: I'm not sure it's safe enough for us.                                                        Bank Employee: It's the safest place in all of Eternum, ma'am. I assure you. The vault is located 7 floors below ground level, and there are armed guards on every floor. Even if something ever        happened, the security system would block all possible exits. And, since there are no Exit Portals  inside the bank, it'd be impossible to escape with any stolen loot.                                 Nancy: And what if someone managed to take all the money without being noticed?                     Bank Employee: Every eternal we have in physical format has a unique tracking number assigned, so   the thief could be easily tracked. Also, all personal belongings, such as your briefcase, are locked inside of an individual safe-deposit box. Each panel has its own combination, allowing for a double layer of security. Even Mr. Garrington himself stores his most valuable items inside our vault.    That should be enough of an endorsement.                                                            Nancy: And what's your defense against magic?                                                       Bank Employee: The main vault has a magic blocker that is operational 24 hours a day. Also, all     clients must pass through 3 different gate controls. Each gate detects the usage of any magical     trickery or similar subterfuge, like invisibility or Polyjuice potion.                              Nancy: I see... I hope that's enough. Alright, let's go down to the vault.                          Bank Employee: Follow me!                                                                           Penelope: *Giggles* Seriously?                                                                      Bennie Garrington: I tell no lies. Obviously, I fired him. I think he's cleaning toilets in Ion now. But anyway, I feel like I've been talking about myself for hours. What about you, babe? How's the  influencer life?                                                                                    Penelope: Oh well, you know... nothing extraordinary about it. Playing video games, streaming on    Twitch, interacting with fans. The same thing every day. It gets a little repetitive. Your life     seems much more... interesting.                                                                     Bennie Garrington: *Chuckles* You've seen nothing yet. Maybe we can continue this conversation in my private suite... in my hotel...                                                                    Penelope: *Giggles* Wow, you have a hotel too? Amazing. Your offer sounds really great... just let  me finish my drink, and we can head upstairs...                                                     Bennie Garrington: Yeah, you can follow me up the stairs to the hotel overlooking the casino. Both  me and my father have suites.                                                                       Penelope: I'll try not to take too long then...                                                     Sit between them                                                                                    Orion: Excuse me, sorry, my bad, I’ve got to... Ahh! Finally!                                       Bennie Garrington: What the hell, dude? We were in the middle of a conversation.                    Sit on the other sofa                                                                               Orion: Ahh! Finally! Nice to meet you!                                                              Bennie Garrington: Are you talking to me? Who the fuck are you?                                     Orion: Ahh! Finally! Nice to meet you!                                                              Bennie Garrington: Are you talking to me? Who the fuck are you?                                     Orion: Mr. Garrington! I'm a big fan! I've always admired how your family built an empire out of    nothing!                                                                                            Bennie Garrington: Thank you. You can fuck off now.                                                 Orion: You must be wondering why I'm here.                                                          Bennie Garrington: No.                                                                              Orion: Just like you, I'm an entrepreneur, and I've come to make you an offer you can't refuse.     Bennie Garrington: What offer? And how did you get into the VIP section?                            Orion: *Standing up* Would you be so kind as to take out of the fridge the bottle I gave you, young lady?                                                                                               Waitress: Of course, sir.                                                                           Orion: This is my exclusive Marani Wine. Aged in oak barrels for seven years in a special server    with experimental time dilation, we’ve created a wine that’s aged nearly 30 years in a quarter of   the time! We believe we’ve created the perfect wine! And we think Garrington’s Casino would be the  perfect partner for us to market and sell that wine!                                                Bennie Garrington: *Sighs* Wine? For the casino? It's my father who deals with that stupid stuff, so stop bothering me about it.                                                                        Orion: Oh... I'm sorry, I thought you had some power in the company too. My bad.                    Bennie Garrington: Hey, hey, hold your horses, buddy. It's not that. I have just as much power as my father.                                                                                            Orion: In that case, I insist that you take a sip of my wine. Believe me, you'll order a full       shipment after tasting it.                                                                          Penelope: Can I be the one to taste it? *Giggles* Wine always makes me feel a little... naughty...  Bennie Garrington: In that case... maybe you should drink the whole bottle...                       Orion: That's not a good idea... This wine is only for Mr. Garrington...                            Bennie Garrington: Nonsense. Drink as much as you want, baby...                                     Orion: Wait, no!                                                                                    Penelope: *Drinks all of it* Ugh... It tastes bitter...                                             Bennie Garrington: Seriously? Did you really try to sell me sour wine?                              Penelope: My throat feels sore... And I’m feeling a little nauseous...                              Bennie Garrington: You ok? Do you want to–                                                          Penelope: *Coughs*                                                                                  Bennie Garrington: Jesus Christ, be careful! Cover your mouth when you're coughing.                 Penelope: Agh... I feel awful all of a sudden...                                                    Bennie Garrington: W-What the fuck is that?! What happened to your face?!                           Penelope: I'm d-dying...                                                                            Bennie Garrington: F-Fuck! Go get a doctor or something, Brad!                                      Security Officer: But where?                                                                        Bennie Garrington: I don't know, anywhere! Someone in the fucking casino has gotta be a doctor in   the real world, right??                                                                             Security Officer: O-Okay!                                                                           Penelope: Fuck, my insides are burning... I can't b-breathe...                                      Bennie Garrington: Are you allergic to something??                                                  Penelope: Help me...                                                                                Bennie Garrington: I'm not touching you! Get away from me!                                          Penelope: It hurts so much... I can't... *Collapses*                                                Bennie Garrington: What the fuck?!                                                                  Security Officer: I found a doctor!                                                                 Bennie Garrington: It’s about damn time! D-Do something, doctor! She started coughing, her face blew up, and then she fainted!                                                                          Luna: Hmmm... Oh my god... She's dead... She's been poisoned with Hydroxynosinemate toxin. Don't let anybody else touch her body or get too close to her. It's highly contagious and absolutely lethal. As long as she didn’t get too near or directly cough on anyone, we should be relatively safe.       Bennie Garrington: What do you mean LETHAL?! I touched her! S-She coughed all over me! Am I         infected?!                                                                                          Luna: You touched her...? Oh god, then it is very likely, yes...                                    Bennie Garrington: W-What?! What's gonna happen to me? What's this Hydroxynomanate toxin?!          Luna: The Hydroxynosinemate toxin was synthesized 4 years ago in a clandestine laboratory in Eastern Europe, when the Albanian mafia got tired of not being able to apply enough punishment to          traitors... ...It was specially designed with the goal of inflicting as much pain as possible within Eternum. In a world where dying is not a true punishment, they decided to create something worse   than death... the worst of tortures... the Hydroxynosinemate compound. With such a high,            concentrated dose, this woman died within seconds. However, in your case... you won't be that lucky. When the toxin gets into your bloodstream, absorbed through the skin, you start to feel dizzy after a few minutes. Then, your eyes swell and you start having trouble breathing. Sweating, chills,     fever and migraines start. Before you can even react, you experience muscular paralysis and lose    control of your limbs... and sphincter. Your skin starts peeling off, and your thinnest capillaries rupture, causing an internal hemorrhage throughout your body. Your lungs are filled with blood,     provoking a choking sensation that can last several minutes. Finally, your nervous system fully     collapses, causing a chain reaction that physicians describe as being burned alive. They say the    pain is so heinous that the brain is unable to recover and attempts to shut itself down. Because of the nature of the neural implant, this can cause chronic ailments both in Eternum and in real life. All those who have suffered its effects have been confined to psychiatric hospitals where they still cry out in pain or, if they’re lucky, managed to kill themselves before being locked away.         Bennie Garrington: *Hyperventilating* S-So... A-Am I already d-doomed??! THERE'S N-NOTHING I CAN    D-DO?!                                                                                              Luna: I'm afraid that... Yeah, you probably can.  But you have to wash your hands and face          immediately. You should hurry.                                                                      Bennie Garrington: GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!                                                      Security Officer: Be careful! He's infected!                                                        Bennie Garrington: And kill the fucking bastard who tried to poison me!!!                           Security Officer: Yes sir!                                                                          Orion: Wait, wait, wait! This was all just a big misundersta–                                       Bank Employee: And here it is! The Garrington vault. More than 100 feet of reinforced concrete in   all directions – impossible to break into. 1668 days since inauguration, and not a single successful robbery!                                                                                           Nancy: Good... This is exactly what my boss was looking for. How many security officers were there  again?                                                                                              Bank Employee: There's over 40 in the bank alone, plus another 50 in the casino hotel, ready to     mobilize at a moment’s notice, in case of emergency.                                                Nancy: Excellent... Alright, let's not waste any more time.                                         Bank Employee: Can you open the main vault, please? Authorization code number 23547.                Security Officer: They both have passed through the Polyjuice scanners.                             Security Officer: Authorization code verified. You can retrieve your belongings now. Opening the    main vault.                                                                                         Bank Employee: Your designated deposit box will be D-32. And you will receive the only copy of the  key, of course.                                                                                     Nancy: Hmm...                                                                                       Dalia: Alright Saturn, I can deactivate the magic blocker inside the vault from here, but not for   more than 60 seconds. After that, an alarm is triggered and the whole server gets locked. Once the  distraction starts, leave the case and get out as fast as you can. Are you ready?                   Nancy: Mm-hm...                                                                                     Bank Employee: Ms. Vasiliev? Is there a problem?                                                    Dalia: Disabling magic blocker... now!                                                              Nancy: *Entering the vault* No problem. I was just admiring this construction.                      Dalia: And the show starts in 3... 2... 1...                                                        Nancy: W-What was that?!                                                                            Bank Employee: Uh...                                                                                Raul: Everybody get down! THIS IS A ROBBERY!                                                        Player: Oh god, please don't kill me!                                                               Raul: Don't try anything funny and you won't get hurt. We're just here for the money! We want $10   million in unmarked bills delivered in one hour's time.                                             Jerry: STAY ON THE FU–                                                                              Raul: Oh shit, they have snipers!                                                                   Security Officer: Officer number 34 reporting, attempted robbery in the bank's main hall. I repeat, attempted robbery in Garrington's bank. I request immediate fire support. All units from the bank   and hotel, maintain radio contact and move now!                                                     Nancy: What on Earth is going on up there?!                                                         Bank Employee: I assure you this rarely happens, ma'am! Just leave the suitcase here, it's the      safest place in all the bank! R-Rest assured, nothing will happen!                                  Nancy: Are you sure?                                                                                Bank Employee: Absolutely!                                                                          Nancy: *Leaving the suitcase* You’d better be right...                                              Bank Employee: We can go back once the situation is under control, don't worry. It's just better if we keep the vault closed for now.                                                                   Security Officer: Closing the vault!                                                                Bank Employee: P-Please ma'am, follow me. We can get to the nearest Exit Portal by using the        Emergency Exit.                                                                                     Nancy: If something happens to that case, my boss will be really upset. And that will make ME very  upset. Do you understand the importance of this matter?                                             Bank Employee: O-Of course, ma'am!                                                                  Chicken: *Chirps* *Jumps* *Chirps*                                                                  Dalia: Aaaand... magic blocker enabled again in 3... 2... 1...                                      Alex: Ugh...  It feels weird when I don't transform myself willingly. Alright, let's get to work... Dalia: Can you hear me, hottie?                                                                     Alex: *Connecting the earplug* Loud and clear. I'm sorry I added a shirt, I know you were enjoying  the view.                                                                                           Dalia: *Chuckles* I won't confirm or deny those allegations. The chick was adorable, though.        Alex: I usually prefer my dragon or shark forms, but I'll admit this one can be very useful too.    Alright, so... How's the diversion tactic in the main hall going?                                   Dalia: Um...                                                                                        Raul: This job is gonna be more difficult than we thought, Noah. We underestimated the amount of men they could bring.                                                                                  Noah: You must retreat and go back to the Exit Portal. I'll stay and stall them. We can't afford to lose your level and inventory. Not after all we've been through.                                    Raul: You have just as much to lose as I do.                                                        Noah: Still, better to lose one than to lose both.                                                  Raul: . . . Do you remember what I told you in the trenches in Sarajevo? That day 30 years ago?     Noah: . . . You'll never fight alone.                                                               Raul: And you never will, my brother. Let's have one last dance.                                    Noah: To hell and back, moj brate.                                                                  Raul: To hell... and back.                                                                          Dalia: They're doing fine, I think.                                                                 Alex: Ok, so... which one’s Garrington's box?                                                       Dalia: A-26.                                                                                        Alex: *Picking the lock* Okay, let's see what we have here...                                       Dalia: So where did an upper-class, bougie girl like you learn to pick locks?                       Alex: Oh, you don't wanna know...                                                                   Dalia: *Chuckles* Be honest, you just wanted people to think you were a bad girl.                   Alex: I'll admit that–                                                                              Dalia: Oh shit... some of them are coming back to the vault!                                        Alex: Fuck, really?                                                                                 Dalia: Yeah! There are 4 or 5 of them!                                                              Alex: How did they find out?                                                                        Dalia: I don't know! But... T-They have explosives! Neptune, you gotta hide!                        Alex: I don't know if you've seen it, but there's not much room to hide in here. Can you disable the magic blocker again? Mars?                                                                         Dalia: Neptune? Hello? Can you hear me? Neptune! Fuck, they cut off communications!                 Alex: Come on, open up...                                                                           Dalia: Watch out! They're opening the vault!!                                                       Alex: Come on...                                                                                    Security Officer: Blow the door off!                                                                Alex: Wait, what?! Wait, wait, wa–                                                                  Orion: . . .                                                                                        Cornelius Garrington: *Laughs* You've been watching the clock for a while now. Were you expecting   something to happen?                                                                                Orion: . . .                                                                                        Cornelius Garrington: I guess they must have arrested your friend in the vault already.             Orion: W-What...?                                                                                   Cornelius Garrington: *Laughs* Did you really think I wasn't going to see that coming? The          distraction tactic is older than Rome, boy. The attempt to poison my son, the attack on the bank... it was all to distract me and my men, so you could sneak into my vault and steal my Gem of Doom, am I right?                                                                                            Orion: How the fuck did you...                                                                      Cornelius Garrington: How did I know? I've lived a long time, son. Many others have tried before.   But I'll be honest, I'm still curious about how you found out that I have a Gem of Doom.            Orion: Son of a bitch!                                                                              Cornelius Garrington: *Laughs* And do you know what the funniest thing is? The Gem of Doom isn't    even there! My personal safe is totally empty! I'd have paid to see the face of whoever opened it!  All that work and you weren't even close!                                                           Orion: E-Empty...? Fuck... I knew this whole plan was too hasty...                                  Cornelius Garrington: Ah, that must be my men telling me the job is done. Garrington. Is it done? Do you have them?                                                                                     Security Officer: We went to the security room, sir. The camera operators were unconscious, but     whoever did it escaped before we arrived. Also, the shooting in the bank lobby has gotten           complicated. Those two men are way tougher than we thought.                                         Cornelius Garrington: Whatever, let them go. We'll get them later. Tell me about the vault.         Security Officer: We're inside, sir. It’s... empty.                                                 Cornelius Garrington: What do you mean, "empty"?                                                    Security Officer: All the money is still on the table, they haven't touched anything.               Cornelius Garrington: Of course, because they know it's marked. Did you get their thief?            Security Officer: There's no one here. And only your personal box was open. It’s empty.             Cornelius Garrington: I know it's fucking empty. But if the box was open, then they must have been  in there!                                                                                           Security Officer: There's no one, sir. We've checked everything and everywhere. The only thing we   found out of place was this strange piece of cardboard.                                             Cornelius Garrington: Cardboard? What cardboard?                                                    Security Officer: Um... It's just a white paper with a drawing and the word "Chang'd" written on it. We don't know what it means.                                                                       Cornelius Garrington: What? Are the... . . . . . . *Standing up* Put me through to the guards at the door of my suite.                                                                                  Security Officer: Um... ...I don't think there's anyone there right now.                            Cornelius Garrington: WHAT?! What did you say?!                                                     Security Officer: A-All our guards from the casino and hotel moved to the bank after your call! W-We were already running short on men because of the shooting at the bank!                             Cornelius Garrington: You left my suite unprotected?!                                               Security Officer: It's c-completely impenetrable, sir! Even if there's no surveillance, the magic   blockers are always active, and the door has a titanium deadbolt and a reinforced jam! The windows  are made with bulletproof glass, and the ventilation system is too small for anyone to pass         through!                                                                                            Bennie Garrington: YOU! This guy is the one who tried to poison me, Dad! Their group tried to kill  me not once, but twice!                                                                             Cornelius Garrington: Twice...?                                                                     Bennie Garrington: Yeah! When I was going to the bathroom to remove the poison from my skin, I was  attacked by a kid! She tried to cut me with a knife! I mean, I didn't see the knife, but... she     scratched me!                                                                                       Cornelius Garrington: What are you talking about? Kids can't enter the casino.                      Bennie Garrington: Um... Well, to be honest, I didn't see her clearly. Maybe she was an adult. But  in any case, she was no taller than... this. I think...                                             Cornelius Garrington: Small enough to fit through the ventilation system?                           Bennie Garrington: What?                                                                            Cornelius Garrington: . . .                                                                         Annie: Ohhh... It's so shiny! It looks just as pretty as the one we found in the spooky server! It  looks just as pretty as I imagined! And it's so cold...                                             Security Officer: F-Fuck, they've locked it from the inside! Open up!                               Annie: Time to go!                                                                                  Cornelius Garrington: You motherfucker...                                                           Orion: We didn't really know where the Gem was, but there were only two options: the bank's vault,  or the safe with the genetic scanner in your suite. We couldn't risk it, so we had to plan a        simultaneous, two-pronged attack. While some of us were breaking into the vault, others would also  sneak into your suite: unprotected because of the attack, and breachable thanks to your son’s       genetic sample. There was also a third option, that you were carrying it around the whole time, but judging by your reaction, I don’t think that's the case.                                            Cornelius Garrington: You're never going to escape from here with it...                             Orion: Ahh, well... That's where you're wrong. We had a good escape plan. A damn good one. The      easiest part of the heist, really. It almost feels like cheating, to be honest. We still had to find out a way to sneak in, of course. It was a challenge to get into the vault and the suite unnoticed, but exiting was never a huge concern... *Standing up* This lady here can create portals to and from wherever we want. And she’s unaffected by magic blockers or restrictions of any kind. We're        immensely lucky to be assisted by the Princess of the Sy-tel-quessir herself...                     Calypso: That is better. I appreciate that you are finally treating me with due respect.            Orion: Anything to please my beloved Princess...                                                    Calypso: Is this what you were looking for?                                                         Orion: Hell yeah! I’m guessing Pluto gave this to you. Is she safe?                                 Calypso: They all are. You are the last one.                                                        Orion: Excellent! Was it too tiring to open so many portals?                                        Calypso: I had enough time to prepare myself. And they were all near each other, and in the same    world. That made it easier. I am feeling stronger too. Soon I will be able to return to my homeland. I can feel it.                                                                                     Orion: I'm happy to hear that. Please don’t overexert yourself. Well, it's been a pleasure, Mr.     Garrington. Take care and give your employees raises, they definitely deserve them after tonight.   Oh, and no worries Bennie, the Hydroxynosinemate toxin doesn't exist, so you can sleep soundly      tonight.                                                                                            Bennie Garrington: W-What is going on? Y-You had a Gem of Doom, Dad? And they just stole it?!       Orion: Nah, I wouldn't say "steal." Someone once told me that in Eternum, things don't actually get stolen... They just happen to... move around.                                                       Cornelius Garrington: . . .                                                                         Bennie Garrington: Um... Dad?                                                                       Cornelius Garrington: . . .                                                                         Orion: Oh my god, we did it! We fucking did it, girls!!! We... (Wait... Why am I in the Main Nexus? Wasn't I using a portal?)                                                                           Idriel: Heads.                                                                                      Orion: *Turning around* Oh... H-Hi, Idriel. Why... Why am I here?                                   Idriel: Heads. You were redirected here after using an Exit Portal. We detected you own a Gem of    Doom now. Congratulations.                                                                          Orion: Oh... Y-Yeah! Thank you! It's not the first time I've had one, though.                       Idriel: Heads. I know. But this time is special. We're holding an exclusive dinner this Saturday    evening, at the Rockefeller server. Only the most important people of Eternum are invited, and that includes... the owners of Gems of Doom. Heads.                                                      Orion: Oh... that's... awesome! I had no idea.                                                      Idriel: The invitation of the previous owner of this Gem will be revoked, and given to you instead. If you lose your Gem before Saturday, you'll lose your invitation as well.                          Orion: I'll make sure not to lose it. Thank you so much.                                            Idriel: Heads. You can bring a guest of your choice. Obviously, given the nature of the event, all  kinds of violence or attempted robberies are forbidden. And finally, all guests must wear masks     during the ceremony, to avoid disclosing the identities of the other Gem holders.                   Orion: That makes sense. What do I have to do to go there?                                          Idriel: Heads. Just join the associated server and enter the Boyle mansion. You will be given access to both when the time comes.                                                                       Orion: Wonderful. Thanks, Idriel.                                                                   Idriel: Do you have any questions about anything?                                                   Orion: Um... Well, now that you mention it, can I ask what level I am?                              Idriel: Heads.                                                                                      Orion: I see... Thank you. Uh... well, I guess that was all. Will I see you at the dinner?          Idriel: Of course. As long as you don't lose your Gem. Heads.                                       Orion: Alright. I guess I'll log off now. I'm pretty tired. And hungry. Bye!                        Idriel: Until next time, Orion. Heads... Or tails...?                                               Heads                                                                                               Orion: Heads.                                                                                       Tails                                                                                               Orion: Tails. (Okay... I finally feel like everything is under control. It should be safe to play   Eternum again. Not the New Vegas server, though. Garrington must have left no stone unturned to find clues about us. But he only knows our faces. As long as we keep low profiles, we should be good.   Eternum is just too big, and technically we didn't even do anything illegal, according to Eternum's Code of Ethics. So... getting back to this balance statement... We got 1170 eternals from Bobbie... Plus the 880 unmarked eternals Bennie was carrying in his wallet when Annie took it... Minus the    costs of the outfits and materials... The chip we needed to hack into their system and create our   fake ID profiles... And the cost of hiring Raul and Noah... We’re left with a net... ...loss of 120 eternals. Goddammit. At least Jerry helped us for free because of Dalia. And... well, I won         something at the slots. Could be worse.)                                                            Alex: More coffee?                                                                                  Orion: More coffee? God, no, please. Tell whoever made it that it's absolutely terrible.            Alex: Ha, ha. Very funny.                                                                           Orion: Oh shit, sorry! Did you make it?                                                             Alex: Fuck off, you know I did. Why did you come here again?                                        Orion: I was on my way to the gym, and I remembered this was the cafe where you said you were       working after school. And I had to crunch some numbers, so... I thought I'd enjoy a coffee here.    Alex: I see...                                                                                      Orion: I'd ask you to sit with me for a moment, but your boss would probably be mad at you.         Alex: Actually, I'm on my 10 minute break.                                                          Orion: Oh! Would you mind spending it with me, then? There's something I have to ask you.           Alex: By the look on your face, it seems important... Okay, tell me.                                Orion: It's about that dinner at the Boyle mansion... The one I was invited to after getting        Garrington's Gem.                                                                                   Alex: Mm-hm.                                                                                        Orion: I've been talking with the others and we think that it should be you who comes with me.      Alex: Who, me? Why?                                                                                 Orion: You've been living in these circles all your life, so you probably know how to blend in      better than any of us.                                                                              Alex: Um... Really? Have you seen me? Do I look like someone who would blend in among a bunch of    snobs?                                                                                              Orion: I know you hate that kind of stuff, but I'm also sure you've been around people like that for a while now. You're our best way of getting information from that dinner.                          Alex: That's a fair point... But my father will probably be there. I don't want him to see me.      Orion: Idriel told me that all the guests will be wearing masks to preserve anonymity. You'll also  have to use some kind of makeup to conceal the tats, but... that should be enough.                  Alex: Oh... That's cool. That... changes things a little. Yeah, okay, I'll go with you.             Orion: Nice! Thanks, Alex. Don't make any plans for Saturday night.                                 Alex: I won't.                                                                                      Orion: Alright, mission successful. I can happily go to the gym now.                                Alex: Ah, yeah. The gym competition is this afternoon, isn't it?                                    Orion: Yep! Dalia's been pretty nervous about it the last few days. She's been talking about it for weeks.                                                                                              Alex: I know, I'm happy that she could recover from her back injury in time. This is very important to her.                                                                                             Orion: Aren't you participating?                                                                    Alex: I already did. There's a bunch of categories, so they're divided into three days. The swimming events were yesterday.                                                                             Orion: Oh, really? I'd have liked to come and see you. Did you win?                                 Alex: You doubt me?                                                                                 Orion: I don't! Dalia told me you're the best swimmer in the country.                               Alex: Bah, she always exaggerates. I don't exaggerate, though, and I can tell she's very good at    fitness. Wish her luck for me.                                                                      Orion: I will! Oh shit, I should get going if I want to get there on time. Dalia asked me not to go.Alex: You better do as she says, then. She kicks hard.                                              Orion: *Chuckles* Oh, I know. No gym for me today, then.                                            Alex: *Standing up* Well, I gotta get back to work. Thanks for coming by.                           Don't tip her                                                                                       Orion: My pleasure. See ya!                                                                         Give her a small tip                                                                                Orion: I haven't paid for my coffee. Take this, you can keep the change.                            Alex: You don't have to give me anything, no worries.                                               Orion: It's an investment. Use it to buy me a couple of drinks when I visit your new apartment.     Alex: My apartment? What makes you think I'll invite you after I've moved?                          Orion: You wouldn't dare leave me out, would you?                                                   Alex: Erm... I'll think about it.                                                                   Orion: I'll take that.                                                                              Alex: Thanks for the tip, in any case.                                                              Orion: My pleasure, Alex. See you later!                                                            Alex: Bye, Orion.                                                                                   Give her a big tip                                                                                  Orion: I haven't paid for my coffee. Take this, you can keep the change.                            Alex: What? $50? I don't want that much.                                                            Orion: Come on, take it. I know you're moving soon, you'll need the money.                          Alex: I don't need your charity, thank you. I can handle myself.                                    Orion: Okay, okay, as you like. See you later!                                                      Alex: Ha, ha. Very funny. *Sighs* Why did you say you came again?                                   Orion: Well, I wanted to ask you something. It's about that dinner at the Boyle mansion... I've been talking with the others and we think that it should be you who comes with me.                      Alex: What? Why me?                                                                                 Orion: You've been living in these circles all your life, so you probably know how to blend in      better than any of us.                                                                              Alex: I've never liked those fancy dinners or whatever this shit is.                                Orion: Come on... please, Alex!                                                                     Alex: Uhh... *Sighs* Well, I guess I can drop by. For our common goal. You wouldn't get anything out of it without me. And I told you not to call me Alex.                                              Orion: S-Sorry, I forgot. But... great! I'll arrange everything!                                    Alex: Okay.                                                                                         Orion: Do I have any special disco–                                                                 Alex: No.                                                                                           Orion: Um... o-okay. Ring me up! (Well, I should get going. The competition is about to start. Dalia will be happy to see me there. Now that the gym plan was canceled, I think I'll spend the day      playing Eternum. A little extra practice never hurt! Or so I hope...) Hi Millie!                    Nikolay: Кто не рискует, тот не пьет шампанского.                                                   Orion: Oh... I thought... Um... Is Millie here? I came for the competition.                         Nikolay: Милли наверху. Соревнование.                                                               Orion: Okay, I don’t think we'll get anywhere like this...                                          Nancy: He said that Millie's upstairs.                                                              Orion: *Turning around* What? *Laughs* You speak Russian now?                                       Nancy: *Chuckles* No, but Millie is upstairs, in the fitness room. So I’m guessing that's what he   said. Did you come to participate in the competition?                                               Orion: Nah, I just came to see Dalia.                                                               Nancy: Oh... so you can come and see her, but I can't? Interesting... I wanted to stay too, but she begged me to go home because she said she'd get nervous... Looks like she's playing favorites...    that's not fair.                                                                                    Orion: I guess that I'm just too persuasive.                                                        Nancy: That must be it... But well, I have a busy afternoon, so I probably shouldn’t have stayed    anyway. Thank god tomorrow is Friday.                                                               Orion: Yeah, it's been a crazy week.                                                                Nancy: I haven't been able to play Eternum since the heist.                                         Orion: Well, if it's any consolation, neither have I. This Saturday, I need to log in no matter     what, though.                                                                                       Nancy: Ah yes, the Ulysses dinner, right?                                                           Orion: Yep. I'll tell you all about it after I finish.                                              Nancy: Can't wait! I'll probably go to Semper Invicta while you're there. I have an Empire to rule, ya'know.                                                                                            Orion: *Chuckles* True. And... we still have... a yoga class pending... right?                      Nancy: That’s a good boy. I haven't forgotten, don't worry... I hope you can keep up with me this   ti–                                                                                                 Gertrude: *Hearty laugh* Come on Nan! I have to show you my hubby's new company car! Don't even ask how much it costs!                                                                                  Nancy: O-Okay, I won't.                                                                             Gertrude: *Hearty laugh* More than $50,000!                                                         Orion: Uhh... well, see you later!                                                                  Gertrude: Oh... Hi Dalia. I'll borrow your mom for a while... You don't mind, do you?               Play along                                                                                          Orion: Yeah, sure, I don't mind... Bye... “mommy.”                                                  Nancy: Uhh... I'll see you at home!                                                                 Correct her                                                                                         Orion: *Sighs* I'm not Dalia. I've told you a hundred times. I'm not Nancy's daughter. I mean, I'm  not even a girl! Do I have to spell it out or what?                                                 Gertrude: *Hearty laugh* Sorry, I always get everyone's names mixed up! As the PTA president, I have a lot on my mind...                                                                                Orion: Sure... Anyway, goodbye Nancy.                                                               Nancy: *Chuckles* I'll see you at home!                                                             Orion: (Jesus, Nancy's flirting is out of control. With so many people living under the same roof,  it'll be hard to find some time alone. But oh boy, when we do...)                                   Nikolay: Рыжая хочет тебя трахнуть!                                                                 Orion: Um... Yeah, I'll go upstairs, thank you! I'm gonna go to the fitness room. Thanks! I guess.  Okay... Now where's Dalia...                                                                        Chang: Hey buddy!                                                                                   Orion: Hey! There's Chang the Heist Meister! It's been a while already and I still can't believe    everything went as you predicted.                                                                   Chang: Obviously. What did you expect from Chang the Brain?                                         Orion: *Chuckles* I should have expected nothing less, I guess. That's a nice shirt you’ve got      there, by the way.                                                                                  Chang: Right?                                                                                       Orion: I assume you came to cheer on Micaela.                                                       Chang: You're goddamn right! I...                                                                   Micaela: Hi guys! Are you working, Chang?                                                           Chang: W-working? Ah, n-no! I just finished my shift and I thought I'd stay to...                   Micaela: Oh my god, did you really order that shirt? I thought it was a joke!                       Chang: Oh... this? I-It's nothing! I have one with Orion's face too.                                Orion: You do? I-I mean, yeah, he does! Haha. Classic Chang.                                        Micaela: Still, it's a bit embarrassing...                                                          Chang: Oh... I can take it off!                                                                     Micaela: No! I mean... don't worry! It's... okay, I guess.                                          Millie: OKAY EVERYONE! Let's start the Weightlifting Finals!                                        Orion: Hey Millie! Have you seen Dalia?                                                             Millie: She said she was going to drink some water 10 minutes ago, and she hasn't returned since. I was waiting for her, but after the weightlifting competition we still have to do seven other        categories. I can't put it off anymore.                                                             Orion: Oh, really? That's weird... (Maybe something happened to her?) I'll go look for her! Give us 10 more minutes, please!                                                                            Millie: Um... *Sighs* Okay, 10 minutes! But that’s it!                                              Orion: Thanks! I'll be right back! (Where the hell is she? She's been talking about this competition since I arrived to Kredon, no way she went home.) Hmm? (Oh boy, I'd recognize that ass anywhere... What on Earth is she doing there?)                                                                  Dalia: *Stops chewing* . . .                                                                        Orion: . . .                                                                                        Dalia: . . .                                                                                        Orion: STOP!                                                                                        Dalia: My sandwich!                                                                                 Orion: What the hell, Dalia?! You can't gorge yourself before a competition!                        Dalia: It was just a little snack. I... I’m carbo-loading!                                          Orion: That sandwich was the size of my head! If you eat so much, you’ll feel bloated during the    competition later!                                                                                  Dalia: I know, I know... But... I was nervous. And when I'm stressed out, I eat.                    Orion: You're nervous? Why?                                                                         Dalia: I've taken part in this competition every fall for the last 4 years. And I’ve never won first place in ANYTHING.                                                                                 Orion: That's because Micaela also participates. I'm sure she'd even win in the male categories, if she could join them. Also, who cares if you don't win?                                              Dalia: I do. I... I don't like losing. It makes me feel that all the effort I put into this is      worthless. I think this year I'm gonna stay out of it.                                              Orion: You can't do that! Come on, let's go back. Everyone is waiting for you.                      Dalia: Tell them to start without me. There are all these signs telling me not to compete today.    Orion: What? What signs?                                                                            Dalia: Well, first off, this morning I put my clothes on inside-out. And I didn't even realize until Penelope told me in the kitchen. Then, I saw a black cat on my way here, and he even kept staring  at me for a while, as if he was telling me to turn around. And finally, when I made it to the gym, a guy tripped by the entrance and spilled his protein shake all over me! I had to change my leggings! The universe is trying to tell me to go home.                                                      Orion: I didn't know you were so superstitious.                                                     Dalia: I'm not, really. I... guess I’m just using those things as excuses. It's just that... What's the point of participating if I already know I’m gonna lose?                                        Go back home with her                                                                               Orion: I guess you have a point there. Trying is the first step towards failure. And you don't have to prove anything to anyone. Come on, let's go home.                                                Dalia: So... We leave? Just like that?                                                              Orion: Yeah, I have a better plan: playing Eternum! Let's explore the forests of Ekabar. I've heard some mythical creature is terrorizing the village of Toussaint.                                     Dalia: That sounds fun. Okay, let's go home. Thanks buddy. You're a good friend.                    Orion: (Ouch.) Anytime, Dalia.                                                                      Convince her to participate                                                                         Orion: Those are all just coincidences. I literally wear my underwear inside-out all the time! And  I’ve seen that black cat in the alleyway so many times on the way to school. Plus, that guy that    bumped into you, that was probably just a random accident, don’t read into it so much. I know this  is important to you. You've been training all year, and if you go home now, you'll regret it. Trust me. What's the worst that could happen? Coming in second? Pfft, big deal.                           Dalia: So... we should go back to the competition? Just like that?                                  Orion: Yep. You're strong, and you'll do great. You don't have to worry about anything. And hey,    whatever happens, you'll still have the best ass in the gym.                                        Dalia: *Chuckles* If you say so...                                                                  Orion: Just spitting facts.                                                                         Dalia: Thank you, Orion.                                                                            Orion: Nah, I didn’t do anything. You were just overthinking this stuff. But alright, enough        talking. Let's pump some iron!                                                                      Dalia: Hell yeah! You're goddamn right! I'm strong! Nothing's gonna stop me!                        Orion: That's the Dalia I know!                                                                     Dalia: *Opening the can* To be honest, I don't know what happened to me. *Opening the can* As you   said, I was–                                                                                        Orion: Um... L-Looks like that can was a bit shaken...                                              Dalia: THE UNIVERSE ISN’T MAKING IT EASY, HUH?!                                                     Orion: A-Are you okay?                                                                              Dalia: I'm fine! I'm feeling even stronger now! You can keep sending me signs, universe! It won't   stop me!                                                                                            Orion: (Oh shit, her sports bra is transparent when wet... It's stuck to her skin like honey... And man, her breasts are shaped beautifully, I'd almost forgotten. She doesn’t even need a bra,         really... Should I say something?)                                                                  Tell her about it                                                                                   Orion: Um... Before we go... You probably want to dry off a little bit. I can see your... tits.     Dalia: Huh? Arrghh! Fuck! I knew this damn top was too cheap! For fuck's sake, can anything else    happen to me today?!                                                                                Orion: Do you have a change of clothes?                                                             Dalia: I have one in my locker, but I guess I'll have to shower at home. I'm not gonna put my sweaty clothes back on.                                                                                   Orion: Are you going to get changed, then?                                                          Dalia: Of course I am. Nothing is stopping me! Do you hear me, universe?! FUCK YOU!                 Orion: Okay, hurry up! I'll go back to Millie and try to convince her to wait a couple more minutes!Dalia: Okay! I'll go as fast as I can. Thank you, Orion.                                            Orion: See you up there!                                                                            Say nothing                                                                                         Orion: Um... Okay, let's go.                                                                        Dalia: Nothing is going to stop me now! Do you hear me, universe?! NOTHING! Let's go, Orion, to the fitness room!                                                                                       Gym member: *Whistles* Damn, this gym's membership pays for itself.                                 Dalia: Huh? . . . Arrghh! Fuck! I knew this damn top was too cheap! Were you really going to let me go upstairs like THIS?!                                                                             Orion: I d-didn't notice.                                                                           Dalia: Yeah, sure, don't bullshit me. I'm gonna go change my top, go back there and convince them to wait for me for a couple more minutes!                                                             Orion: Okay! It was a nice bra, though. That's too–                                                 Dalia: Shut the fuck up!                                                                            Orion: S-See you up there! Hey!                                                                     Millie: Finally! Okay, we can start now! The first competition will be bench–                       Orion: W-Wait! She's not ready! Give us a couple of minutes, please.                                Millie: Whaaaat? Not yet? We can't wait anymore, Orion.                                             Orion: Just two minutes! Please!                                                                    Millie: *Sighs* Two minutes! And then we're starting, with Dalia or without her.                    Orion: Thanks!                                                                                      Chang: Did she have any problems?                                                                   Orion: Nah, she was just nervous, but she's feeling better already.                                 Chang: Ah, that happens to all of us. I usually like to relax in a quiet place before something like this.                                                                                              Orion: Actually, she told me there's a private server in Eternum where only she has access. She     should probably have gone there to calm the nerves.                                                 Chang: Are there private servers in Eternum?                                                        Orion: Yeah, that's pretty cool, right? It's like a private beach, and you can only access that     server with a password she chose.                                                                   Chang: That sounds awesome! And how does it work? Is it just a code or...?                          Tell Chang the password                                                                             Orion: Yeah, the server is called "The Cove", and the password is "Stormblade." If you tell them    both to Idriel when you're in the Main Nexus, you're redirected to said server. Pretty simple. Maybe we can chill there when you get yourself a neural implant!                                         Chang: *Chuckles* At the rate I’m blowing through cash, it'll take a few years, but thank you       anyway.                                                                                             Keep it a secret                                                                                    Orion: Yeah... something like that, but I can't tell you, sorry. She asked me to keep it a secret.  Chang: Ah, no worries man. Secrets are meant to be kept. I don't even have a neural implant anyway. Orion: We’ve gotta get you one! Trust me, it has–                                                   Dalia: *Comes in busting out the door*                                                              Orion: There she is!                                                                                Micaela: . . .                                                                                      Dalia: . . .                                                                                        Millie: Okay guys, we're finally ready to start! As always we have 6 finalists selected on the basis of personal records. Let's start with the cardio–                                                  Gym member: Hey Millie, I'm gonna pass, so... don't count me in.                                    Millie: What? Why?                                                                                  Gym member: Have you seen that girl? Her arms are bigger than my torso!                             Millie: But the important thing is taking p–                                                        Gym member: Bullshit! I know you always post the results on social media. I don't come here so      people can laugh at me, thank you very much.                                                        Millie: Well... okay, then. We have 5 finalists! Let the competition begin!                         Chang: You got this, Micaela!                                                                       Orion: Show them what you got, Dalia!                                                               Millie: 50 burpees, 50 pistols, and 50 sit-ups! Time starts... now! Micaela wins this round! Micaela wins! Another medal for Micaela! Micaela sets a new record! MICAELA!                               Dalia: *Panting* *Panting* F-Fuck... I can't... *Panting* I can't lift another pound... *Panting*   She's too strong...                                                                                 Micaela: Well played, Dalia. You've improved a lot over the last year. I'm impressed!               Dalia: . . . ...You too, Micaela. Congratulations on the victory.                                   Micaela: I could only lift 20 more pounds than you during the squats competition! That's insane!    I'll have to train harder if I want to keep up with your progression!                               Dalia: The only thing that counts is that you won and I lost every trial. 20 pounds, 50 pounds...   Who cares? That doesn't matter.                                                                     Micaela: It matters when you consider that I weigh like 130 pounds more than you. I'll admit that   I've always been jealous of how you can be so strong while keeping such a slender body. You don't   know how lucky you are!                                                                             Dalia: If you say so...                                                                             Micaela: Well, I'll go get cleaned up. See you later, Dalia!                                        Dalia: Later...                                                                                     Orion: There you are! I was looking for you!                                                        Dalia: . . .                                                                                        Orion: *Sitting next to her* Holy fucking shit, did you really squat 350 pounds?! You're a monster! Dalia: Okay...                                                                                      Orion: Huh? What's with the long face? You did amazing! Millie said you even beat your personal     best, is that right?                                                                                Dalia: I don't know, maybe. I wasn't paying attention.                                              Orion: Why are you so sad? Did you strain something?                                                Dalia: Don’t patronize me... I'm a fucking loser, and you know it.                                  Orion: What?! Are you kidding me?! You lifted more than any man in the gym!                         Dalia: I've been training every single day during the last year, just to try to win a single medal. And in the end, I didn’t win anything, like always...                                               Orion: Come on, who cares about those shitty medals? It's not even real gold. And you say that as if you were the only one without one. I didn't win a medal... Kai and Nikolay didn't win a medal...   That woman didn't win a medal... Chang didn't w– . . . W-Why do you have a medal?                   Chang: Oh, this? I won it in the air guitar competition.                                            Orion: T-The what...? Since when is there an air guitar competition?!                               Chang: I started teaching that class when I began working here last week. Thursdays at 7:30 PM. “Air Guitar with Chang the Czar.”                                                                       Orion: Um... Okay, forget about Chang. What I'm trying to say is that you did great today. If       Micaela wasn't here, you'd have won every single trial.                                             Dalia: Whatever...                                                                                  Millie: Okay Dalia, time for your last trial. Get ready!                                            Dalia: The MMA fight? I think I'm gonna pass. Micaela has humiliated me enough in front of everyone today.                                                                                              Millie: Nah, your opponent isn’t Micaela.                                                           Dalia: What? She's not?                                                                             Millie: Nope. The MMA tournament was categorized by weight, and none of the participants were in    Micaela’s weight range, so... she couldn't participate.                                             Dalia: Then... who's my opponent?                                                                   Millie: Let me check... Someone named... Brock. Ah... yeah, I remember him. It's that guy who's     always in the steam room.                                                                           Dalia: A guy?                                                                                       Millie: Yeah, but he weighs about the same as you. Here at PUMP IT we are committed to diversity,   inclusion, and gender equality!                                                                     Dalia: Oh... yeah, I think I remember seeing him in spinning class.                                 Millie: He talks a big game, but I've never seen him do anything noteworthy. He qualified for the   finals by a whisker. My money's on you!                                                             Orion: Did you hear that?! The final isn't against Micaela! You can win this one!                   Dalia: . . . I can win this one.                                                                    Orion: Hell yeah!                                                                                   Dalia: I'll destroy this Brock dude.                                                                Orion: To the octagon!                                                                              Millie: Well we don't really have an octagon, we use the boxing room. So... the fighting area is    more like a square. We don't have any professional equipment here.                                  Orion: To the square!                                                                               Dalia: Actually, it's called a boxing ring.                                                         Orion: To the ring, then!                                                                           Brock: HYAAAAAA!!!                                                                                  Gym member: Wow, did you see that?!                                                                 Gym member: He's so fast!                                                                           Brock: I call this... The Crested Crane pose.                                                       Gym member: *Clapping* He's so good!                                                                Kai: I taught him that!                                                                             Orion: *Massaging her shoulders* Okay, that was a pretty damn high kick, but there's no need to be  scared, Dalia.                                                                                      Dalia: I'm not scared.                                                                              Orion: Well you know what I mean, scared, nervous... Whatever it is that’s making you shake.        Dalia: I'm not shaking either! Are you trying to get on my nerves?!                                 Orion: That's the spirit! Channel that anger into your opponent!                                    Dalia: I can kick that thing too.                                                                   Orion: Good! Then you should start with a high kick, his own signature move! We’ll have the element of surprise in our favor, he won't see it coming.                                                   Millie: Alright guys, let's end this last day of competition with a bang! The last medal of this    year is at stake! Kredon's Bantamweight title is decided... NOW! On my left, weighing in at 131     lbs... Brock Domen! And on my right, weighing in at 125 lbs... Dalia Carter!                        Orion: Let's go Dalia! Kick his ass!                                                                Brock: I was starting to think you wouldn't come, Dalia.                                            Dalia: In your dreams.                                                                              Brock: *Laughs* I heard you didn't even win a single medal in the fitness trials. Isn't that kinda  lame? I wonder what the hell you were doing up there everyday... Taking pictures of your ass to post on Instagram, I bet.                                                                               Dalia: Shut the fuck up. I don't know about you, but I only come here to train.                     Brock: *Laughs* And yet you didn't manage to win anything? That's even sadder! Well at least you’re experienced at losing. Another defeat won't make much of a difference. Maybe you can convince them  to give you a consolation prize, as the biggest loser?                                              Dalia: Can't wait to kick in that ugly face of yours.                                               Millie: And the fight starts... NOW!                                                                Gym member: Kill him!                                                                               Nikolay: дерись!                                                                                    Gym member: Destroy her!                                                                            Brock: HYAAAAA!                                                                                     Millie: Um... Brock? You dead?                                                                      Brock: . . .                                                                                        Millie: Well, I guess Dalia won the fight! Congratulations!                                         Dalia: What? I... I won?                                                                            Millie: Yeah!                                                                                       Dalia: I won... Orion! I won! I won! Did you see that?!                                             Orion: You bet I did! Holy shit, what a kick! And you were so fast!                                 Dalia: *Jumping from the ring* Did you notice how I took the same stance we use in Eternum? Before  the kick? Did you?                                                                                  Orion: Hell yeah! I don't know any girl who can kick ass like you. Congrats, Dalia. I know it       probably doesn't mean shit to you, but... I'm really proud of you.                                  Dalia: . . . *Kisses you*                                                                           Orion: (Whoa! Where did that come from?)                                                            Kiss her back                                                                                       Orion: (Damn... She's been exercising and sweating for the past two hours, how the hell can she     still smell so good?)                                                                               Stand still                                                                                         Orion: (I... I wasn't expecting this. What am I supposed to do now?) Wow... That was...             Dalia: . . . . . .                                                                                  Micaela: I didn't know you were dating!                                                             Dalia: W-WHAT?! We're not! We're totally not! Why do you say that?! This is just a misunderstanding!Micaela: What do you mean?                                                                          Chang: Why didn't you tell me, Orion?!                                                              Kai: I already knew, her mom told me. I’m her greatest confidante.                                  Gym member: You two make a great couple!                                                            Dalia: We're not dating! We're just old friends! And d-don't tell my mom!                           Micaela: But you kissed him!                                                                        Dalia: What? That stupid kiss? It's just my way of celebrating a victory! It doesn't mean anything! Micaela: Really?                                                                                    Dalia: Yeah! I kiss everyone when I win! It just happened that Orion was the first one I saw! It    could have been anyone! Look!

Uhh... actually, I’m feeling a slight tickle in my throat. *Coughs* Maybe it’s best if I don’t kiss anyone else...                                                      Brock: *Clears throat* EHEM. Attention, please! Can you read that again, Millie? Say it loudly, so  everyone can hear you.                                                                              Millie: Um... It says here that strikes to the throat of any kind are expressly forbidden.          Dalia: What?                                                                                        Brock: And that means that...                                                                       Millie: Since Dalia knocked out her opponent with an illegal hit, her victory is invalid, and she's disqualified.                                                                                       Dalia: Whaaat?! I didn't win, then?!                                                                Millie: I'm sorry, Dalia... I’ve gotta give the medal to Brock.                                     Dalia: You can't be serious! That is so unfair!                                                     Gym member: Congrats, Brock!                                                                        Brock: Thank you, thank you... I'll be honest, I never doubted that I'd win this competition. The   road to the finals was difficult. I was expecting a tougher opponent in the last trial, but oh      well... it is what it is. Look on the bright side, Dalia! At least you can spend another year       without having to worry about where to put your medals!

Big ass, tiny brains, am I right? *Imitating Dalia* Orion! I won! I won! Did you see it!? Muah Muah *imitates kissing noises* Gym members: *Laugh*                                                                                Dalia: *Sobbing*                                                                                    Brock: *Laughs* Oh my god, is she crying? Come on, don't be sad, you little girl... Do you want a   lollipop, Dalia? I'm sure it'll make you feel better. Seriously, just grow up.                      Orion: Dalia! . . .                                                                                 Brock: *Imitating Dalia* Did you notice how I took the same stance we use in Eternum?               Gym members: *Laugh*                                                                                Say something to him                                                                                Brock: *Imitating Dalia* Did you see it, did you see it?!                                           Orion: What the fuck is wrong with you, dude?                                                       Brock: What do you want?                                                                            Orion: Are you honestly happy winning like this? She kicked your ass up there. You couldn't even    stand up. How can you be so cocky after such a lame "victory"? If we can even call it that.         Brock: I'm the lame one? Go tell that to that crybaby girlfriend of yours. I had to put up with her acting all tough throughout the year, as if she was better than me. What gives her that right? She's just a loser. Serves her right.                                                                    Orion: Whatever you say, man, but she beat you. You're pathetic. Everyone in this room is stronger  than you.                                                                                           Brock: Oh, please, are you including yourself in that statement? Because you couldn't hit me even if I was blindfolded and tied up in front of you.                                                     Orion: Of course I could.                                                                           Brock: I have the reflexes of a feral cat. You'd never be able to touch me, I can assure you.       *Chuckles* Come on, try to hit me, big man. Right here. I bet you...                                Leave                                                                                               Brock: W-W-What the f...

Chang: Okay, okay, calm down everyone.                                                              Gym member: Who are you?                                                                            Chang: Chang Wong, lawyer AND manager of Mr. Richards. I'm afraid you're overwhelming my client. All complaints and contract proposals must go through me first.                                        Orion: *Whispering* Chang?                                                                          Chang: *Whispering* No worries buddy, I’ve got this covered. *Whispering* You should go after Dalia, she seemed pretty shaken up.                                                                       Orion: *Whispering* Thanks man, you're the best! I owe you one!                                     Chang: *Whispering* Anytime, bro!                                                                   Brock: ...can't even get close. Hmm? What? Nothing? As I thought. Come on, get the fuck out of here and stop wasting my time... pussy.                                                                  Nikolay: Me need Orion Saturday in Pitch. He fight. Many money. And woman.                          Chang: Let's discuss this in my office.                                                             Orion: (Chang's right, I should go after Dalia. Although... What an asshole. Bah, let's forget about him. I should go after Dalia. Although... Knowing Dalia, maybe she prefers to be alone right now.  But... on the other hand, maybe she'd appreciate some company. She was so happy when she thought    she'd won... I mean, she even kissed me in the middle of her "euphoria.") Hmm...                    Go after her                                                                                        Orion: (I wonder where she is. Maybe she went home... or to the park. Or...)                        Give her space                                                                                      Orion: (Going after her would just make things worse. She needs some space. I'm sure she'll see     things better in the morning, with a clearer head. Time to go home.)                                Gym member: Blake! Beer me, dude!                                                                   Gym member: Here you go! Cold and bubbly!                                                           Gym member: Thanks, bro.                                                                            Orion: Holy shit! (Look at this! I wasn't expecting a whole beach party here! I guess that’s one way for Dalia to get over the competition. From what she told me, I assumed it was gonna be a quiet    cove. There's a pretty good vibe here, though.) Well, well, well... What do we have here? You forgot to tell me that you threw parties in your "private" server, didn't you?                            Dalia: . . .                                                                                        Orion: Hello? Earth to Dalia.                                                                       Dalia: . . .                                                                                        Orion: Hey, I won't complain, though. It's a really nice setup you have here. Who are all these     people, though? Friends from...?                                                                    Dalia: . . .                                                                                        Orion: Cat got your tongue or what?                                                                 Brock: Welcome to the party!                                                                        Orion: *Turning around* Huh? What? What the fuck are you doing here? Did you seriously invite him   too?                                                                                                Brock: I'm the one who's throwing the party. But don't worry, I'll let you stay. That fucking punch of yours still hurts even in Eternum, not gonna lie... But no worries bro, I don't hold grudges. It was just a lucky hit, anyway...                                                                     Orion: What are you talking about? Do you know the password too?                                    Brock: Of course I do. You told me yourself.                                                        Orion: What? No, I didn't.                                                                          Brock: Of course you did. Don't you remember? In the fitness room, with that friend of yours with   that shirt of Micaela.                                                                              Orion: What?! You were eavesdropping on us?! You're a fucking asshole! That was private!            Brock: It's not as if you were whispering, bro. Having a private server in Eternum and not sharing  it is a very selfish thing, after all. I thought you were inviting everyone in the gym to come. Now it's so much more fun!                                                                              Orion: (Fucking idiot...) *Turning around* O-Okay, I can explain.                                   Brock: Yo guys, let's turn up that music! I want all of Eternum to hear us!                         Orion: I didn't tell him, I swear! But he was spying on me when...                                  Dalia: . . . Don't talk to me ever again.                                                           Orion: W-What? Dalia! Oh... FUCK! (I really screwed the pooch this time...) *Sighs* (I guess I'll   just log off for today... She seemed really upset... And to be fair, she has reasons to be.         Anyway... I'll apologize after she cools off. This is just the bathtub thing all over again.        Tomorrow's another day...)                                                                          Dalia: . . . (Today the sea is very calm. I wish it was always like this... It almost looks like a  pool.) . . . *Sighs* (I'm pathetic.)                                                                Orion: Did you know that sex is a death sentence for octopuses? After the mating is done, it's game over for both of them. The male wanders off to die, and the female guards their eggs so obsessively that she even stops eating. When the eggs hatch, her body undergoes a cascade of cellular suicide   until she dies as well. Quite a sad fate, huh? Nature sure can be cruel.                            Dalia: . . . How did you know where I would be?                                                     Orion: Well, you told me yourself that you liked to come here when you wanted to relax or be alone. I assumed I'd find you here.                                                                        Dalia: When I told you the password, you said that you wouldn't come here without asking for my     permission first.                                                                                   Orion: That’s true. Guilty as charged! I just thought that... after what happened, you'd like to    have some company.                                                                                  Dalia: I don't wanna talk about it.                                                                 Orion: No one's forcing you to! I was just telling you some awesome trivia about the fascinating    world of octopuses. Technically, it was you who interrupted me and my fun facts.                    Dalia: *Snorts* True. I'm sorry. Please continue. Enlighten me.                                     Orion: Thank you. You see... although it's commonly said that they have 8 legs, in fact they have 6 arms and 2 legs. If they are desperately hungry, they can eat their own arms, which will grow again after some time. They have 3 hearts, and their blood is blue!                                       Dalia: Oh, so they're true blue royalty, huh?                                                       Orion: Exactly! Not to mention, they're also said to be the most intelligent animal of all          invertebrates. They say that if octopuses had longer life spans, they would be the dominant species in the world.                                                                                       Dalia: Wow, that's scary.                                                                           Orion: Right? We'd better be on the watch. You never know when they could attack... Plus, you ever  see all that tentacle porn online? That shit’s not something to mess around with.                   Dalia: *Laughs* How the hell do you know all this stuff?                                            Orion: I've always liked the sea and marine life. Do you remember when we went to the Aquarium? When we were like... 7?                                                                                 Dalia: I do! Mom took us there for my birthday. I remember seeing the sharks and thinking...        Orion: "One day I'll have my own boat!  I'll navigate the seven seas and discover all the sea       monsters that are hiding across the world! I'm Dalia the Explorer! "                                Dalia: H-How do you remember that? I thought you said you barely remembered your time in Kredon...  Orion: I was playing with Penny and Luna the other day and we used a device that dug up some old    memories. *Chuckles*And it's hard to forget your "Dalia the Explorer" phase.                        Dalia: I remember seeing the sharks and thinking that one day I'd explore the seven seas with my own boat.                                                                                              Orion: I do remember your "Dalia the Explorer" phase! You kept repeating it all the time.           Dalia: *Sighs* Yeah... That was fun. I miss those carefree days when my only concern was what Mom   would give us for dinner.                                                                           Orion: *Chuckles* If it had been up to me, I'd have only eaten candy and potato chips all day. Good thing that’s changed.                                                                               Dalia: Yeah... Look, Orion... I appreciate you coming here. I really do. But... you can go now,     don't worry about me. I mean, I know what you're thinking. "This drama queen’s overreacting to a    stupid competition that has 0 real-world value. If she'd had any real problems during her lifetime, she wouldn't be crying over something so trivial. What a spoiled little girl."                      Orion: Wow, everything you just said was wrong. I wasn't thinking that at all. I thought you knew me better than that, Dalia. That competition was important to you, and that's all that matters. I've  been hearing you waking up at 5 AM every morning to go train. I've seen your folders full of        different gym programs. I've even seen your sneakers’ soles get completely worn down and reduced to shreds from overuse. No one likes to lose. After so much effort, I'd be pissed too. It's totally    normal.                                                                                             Dalia: It's... It's not even about the damn competition. It's just that... being good at sports is  the one thing I have. I'm not funny. I'm not particularly clever or cunning, like Mom. I don’t have Penny’s supermodel-tier looks. I don't have any talent for music or art... I'm average at           everything. The one thing I had was being... "the fit girl." And if I can't even get that right...  Then I'm nothing.                                                                                   Orion: (Damn, I didn't know Dalia was so insecure deep down. It hurts to see her like this.) You're unique and special, Dalia. You don't have to be the best at something to be somebody. Look at me!   I'm the most average dude you'll ever see! I don't have any real talent, and yet, here I am.        Dalia: That's not true. You're a lot smarter than me. You got offered a full scholarship to         participate in Kredon’s student exchange program. You started playing Eternum a few weeks ago, and  you already managed to surpass me and learn a secret magic no one knows anything about. You're      special... And I'm not. Let’s just stop arguing about it and accept it. Acknowledging and accepting it are the first steps t–                                                                           Orion: *Getting on top of her* Okay, that's enough!                                                 Dalia: W-What are you doing?!                                                                       Orion: You're done talking nonsense for today. You're amazing, Dalia. Everything about you is       amazing. And we're not leaving this beach until you accept it.                                      Dalia: Okay, okay...                                                                                Orion: No, not okay. I want you to say it out loud. "I'm amazing."                                  Dalia: Oh come on, what are we, 5? Don't make me do it.                                             Orion: I don't know about you, but I can stay here all day. This pose is quite comfortable.         Dalia: You're kinda crushing my stomach.                                                            Orion: More reason to do what I say, then.                                                          Dalia: *Sighs* What the hell do you want?                                                           Orion: "I'm amazing."                                                                               Dalia: *Sighs* I'm amazing...                                                                       Orion: Yes, you are. You're funny, you're generous and kind, and you're the strongest girl I know.  You're one of my favorite people to spend time with, and one of the sexiest women I've ever met.    Your face looks beautiful at any time of the day, and you have an absolutely killer body. Oh... And you're a pretty good kisser too.                                                                    Dalia: *Snorts* Shut up! Haha! Don't remind me of that!                                             Orion: *Chuckles* Hey, it's true!                                                                   Dalia: *Chuckles* That was so embarrassing! I don't know what got into me. God, did you see the     looks on their faces? I wish the ground swallowed me up at that moment!                             Orion: Hey, I actually thought... It was a good kiss.                                               Dalia: Yeah, I guess it was... Thank you Orion.                                                     Orion: For what?                                                                                    Dalia: Talking to you made me feel better. It always does... I guess you can add that to the list of your many talents.                                                                                 Orion: I have far too many talents. I’m gonna have to start carrying a list around.                 Dalia: *Chuckles* Oh, really?! Now you're showing your true colors! Your humbleness from before was all a facade, wasn't it? “I’m the most average dude you’ll ever see.” You liar!                     Orion: Oh yeah, totally. Now that you’ve accepted that you're amazing too, I don't have to pretend  anymore. I'm pretty damn awesome, let's be honest.                                                  Dalia: *Laughs* Fuck off.                                                                           Orion: *Laughs*                                                                                     Dalia: Well, I guess we should get going now. I think it's pretty late.                             Orion: Oh, before we leave, I wanted to ask you something... Yeah, I guess it is. I'm really hungry.Dalia: I hope you are, because I'm making dinner tonight. And I'm serving Dalia-sized portions!     Orion: Nice! Do you remember our bet in the Semper Invicta server?                                  Dalia: Oh man, hold your horses bud! Don't you try to take advantage of this situation! Thanks to   you I'm not feeling down anymore, so you won't be able to have your way with me in a moment of      weakness, sorry.                                                                                    Orion: Oh I know, that's why I'm bringing it up.                                                    Dalia: Look, I'm very tired, and my shorts are full of sand, so I'm not in the mood to fight with   you right now. Maybe... another day.                                                                Orion: You should get rid of the sand if it’s making you uncomfortable.                             Dalia: I’m not gonna fight you, Orion. Our... "bet" will have to wait.                              Orion: I know! I just want to tell you something. Trust me, you're gonna love it.                   Dalia: Why are you so pushy? You don't have a chance against me anyway.                             Orion: Ahhh, it's nice to see you regaining self-confidence.                                        Dalia: . . . What are you concocting in that pervy little brain of yours?                           Orion: I'm innocent, I swear.                                                                       Dalia: Of course... Fine, fine, let me “get comfortable.” It was a bad idea to sit down on the sand with pants on, anyway.                                                                              Orion: That's exactly what I'm saying. (Jesus...) This bikini looks good on you, Dalia.             Dalia: Thanks. I knew I liked it beforehand because I have the exact same model in the real world,  so I bought it here as well.                                                                        Orion: You’re definitely looking more comfortable now.                                              Dalia: Oh, for sure...                                                                              Orion: (Oh my fucking god, those hips... Those abs... is it bad that I want to lick them?)          Dalia: Ok, so... what did you want to tell me? I'm all ears.                                        Orion: Ah, yeah. Y’know that asshole from the gym, Brock? The guy you unjustly lost to?             Dalia: Mm-hm.                                                                                       Orion: After you left, we had a little argument, he provoked me, and... I might have punched him in the face. Maybe a bit too hard.                                                                     Dalia: *Snorts* Seriously?                                                                          Orion: Yeah. I think he fell unconscious.                                                           Dalia: Hah! Serves him right. Nice one!                                                             Orion: Yeah, the guy was a total idiot.                                                             Dalia: Definitely. But... I fail to see the connection between this and our bet, though.            Orion: Well, that's the thing... Technically, you lost against him in combat. And technically, I    beat him shortly after. Therefore, by the transitive property, I beat you too.                      Dalia: *Chuckles* Excuse me? That's not how it works at all.                                        Orion: I'm pretty sure it's valid. We didn't specify the rules.                                     Dalia: Yeah, we didn't, but it's common sense. If I had made out with my sister yesterday, does that mean you could say that you’ve kissed Penelope too?                                                Orion: You made out with Penelope yesterday?!                                                       Dalia: *Laughs* Of course not! I'm just trying to show the flaw in your logic.                      Orion: Okay, okay... whatever you say... *Chuckles* It was worth a try, though. I was hoping I      didn't have to punch that pretty face of yours in order to win, but I guess I'll have to do it.     You’ve left me no choice. Unless you find another technicality, of course...                        Dalia: You're the one who's trying to find loopholes in our bet.                                    Orion: *Chuckles* That depends on how you look at it. Anyway, let's go home. I loved spending some  time with you in your server, Dalia. Thanks for letting me visit.                                   Dalia: . . . Okay... let's do it.                                                                   Orion: The Exit Portal inside the cave is the only one around? Have you ever explored the rest of   the island?                                                                                         Dalia: I'm talking about the bet. Let's do it.                                                      Orion: The... W-Wait, what?                                                                         Dalia: Isn't that what you wanted?                                                                  Orion: Um... y-yeah...                                                                              Dalia: *Undoing her bikini* Never let it be said that Dalia doesn't honor her bets. The other day I bet and won 100 eternals in the rotunda from Jasticus' trainer. Sometimes you win, sometimes you    lose...                                                                                             Orion: *Standing up* Did this really work? Or am I dreaming?                                        Dalia: Everything you did for me today really meant a lot. Coming to the competition, giving me that pep-talk before the trials, cheering me on and cheering me up... You came looking for me when I was at one of my lowest points, and you helped me regain my self-esteem. And... well, that kiss        honestly wasn’t half bad. So... as a thank you for everything... I'm choosing not to overthink your definition of "beating me in a fight."                                                              Orion: My god... You're fucking perfect...                                                          Dalia: You’re saying so many nice things today... but well, I can't say I don't like being          praised... I know you already saw me naked, but I hope this can still get you in the mood. Well... I hope this is enough to get you in the mood. It's gonna be difficult to do my part otherwise.       Orion: I doubt that'll be a problem...                                                              Dalia: At least this time I'm getting naked for you voluntarily, not accidentally. You creep.       Orion: I thought it was clear that that was just a huge misunderstanding...                         Dalia: *Giggles* I still have my doubts... *Starts to slowly open your fly*                         Orion: (Oh... fuck yeah!)                                                                           Dalia: What the... Jesus Christ... I wasn't expecting... T-That...                                  Orion: *Taking off your shorts* I mean... You made me so fucking horny, Dalia. Do you see how hard  you made me? I’m like a rock. Couldn't help it. Your tits, your ass, your abs... the entire         package.                                                                                            Dalia: Still, that was way too fast. Did you get hard during our sincere and emotional exchange?    Orion: Of course not... only once you took off your pants. Your tummy is way too sexy.              Dalia: I'll choose to believe you... I don't want to dirty our best memory together.                Orion: Dirty the memory? We're only making it better...                                             Dalia: Yeah, I’m sure we’re making it better for you. Anyways... I should probably start before     this... monster starts going down.                                                                  Orion: I don't think that's gonna happen... Take your time... I’m not in a rush.                    Dalia: *Gets close to you*                                                                          Orion: (Oh fuck yeah...                                                                             Dalia: Jesus, this thing looks huge up close... and the smell...)                                   Orion: You sure you can take it?                                                                    Dalia: Of course.                                                                                   Orion: Is it making you horny?                                                                      Dalia: N-no!                                                                                        Orion: You're in denial today, Dalia...                                                             Dalia: I'm already starting to regret agreeing to this.                                             Orion: Your mouth says that, but your eyes say otherwise...                                         Dalia: Shut up, idiot.                                                                              She starts licking the head of your penis.                                                          Orion: Oh, yeah...                                                                                  Gently kisses and licks you along the length of your cock.                                          Orion: (I can feel how her breathing keeps speeding up...) You're driving me insane, Dalia... Stop  teasing me... Put it inside your mouth, please...                                                   Dalia: I thought you said you weren’t in a rush...                                                  Orion: I might have spoken too soon... Oh, y-yes...                                                 Dalia: Does it feel good?                                                                           Orion: It feels amazing...                                                                          Dalia: *Slight moan*                                                                                Orion: Oh fuck yeah, baby... (Oh my god, Dalia's sucking my cock... This is like a dream come       true...) Oh... fuck, your mouth is so warm... That’s a good girl... (God, I'm stretching her little mouth so much...) That's it, Dalia... Deeper... Make it wet... Now, let's try that ability of yours we talked about all those weeks ago, shall we?                                                      Dalia: Mmmm...?                                                                                     You gently push Dalia's head further onto your cock.                                                Dalia: Mmmph!                                                                                       Orion: Oh f-fuck, yes!                                                                              Dalia: *Recovering her breath* AAahh...                                                             Orion: Holy shit, so it was true, huh? No gag reflex...                                             Dalia: *Panting* I m-might have underestimated the size...                                          Orion: Is it too much for you?                                                                      Dalia: *Panting* Of course not, but... W-Well, I s-still have to breathe, you know? Are you trying  to kill me?                                                                                         Orion: Not at all... I'll let you set the pace... Be as greedy as you want.                         Dalia: Hmmmph...                                                                                    Orion: Oh yeah... that's a good girl... Ohhhh Jesus... (She's taking it so fucking deep... God, I   can feel the tip of my cock slipping down her throat... And yet, she keeps taking it in and out     without a single gag...)                                                                            Dalia: *Moans*                                                                                      Orion: H-Holy shit, Dalia, you're a fucking natural... It’s so tight... almost feels like a pussy... Ahhh... Your throat’s squeezing me so much... Y-You're enjoying this too, aren't you?              Dalia: Mmmmhmm...                                                                                   Orion: That’s what I thought... You dirty girl... Come here, I wanna fuck your juicy mouth...       Dalia: *Moans*                                                                                      Orion: That’s it... A-A-Aaaahh f-fuck yes...! Oh my god, Dalia...! (It slides in so easily... her   throat feels tight, but there’s no resistance...)                                                   Dalia: Mmmm...!                                                                                     Orion: Ahhh.... You're basically drooling, Dalia... You like my cock that much?                     Dalia: Mmmph...                                                                                     Orion: You're doing an amazing job... Oh god... If you wanna stop, just give me a sign, babe...     Dalia: Mmm...!                                                                                      Orion: (At first I thought she was trying to prove something, but looking at her face I can tell    she's enjoying it...) Aaaahhh... Fuck, I don't think anyone could take it so deep and so fast... Oh f-fuck yeah... Do you like getting your mouth fucked, Dalia?                                        Dalia: Hmph... mmph... mmph...                                                                      Orion: That’s it, work all that cum out... (And her tongue gliding on the underside of my dick feels too good, even if it barely has space to move...) Oh g-god... I think I'm gonna cum... I can't hold it...!                                                                                             Dalia: *Pulls away and takes several breaths* F-FUCK! *Lies back on the sand* J-Jesus...! *Panting* T-Too much... d-dick... N-Need... oxygen!                                                           Orion: Are you okay?                                                                                Dalia: *Panting* Fuck yeah, I am... It's just that... t-that thing is... too big... I couldn't      fucking breathe... How do they do that shit in porn!?                                               Orion: *Getting on top of her* Oh shit, Dalia... You have no idea how close I am...                 Dalia: Oh, that's too bad... poor baby Orion...                                                     Orion: My balls are about to explode...                                                             Dalia: Stop groping me!                                                                             Orion: Your boobs are fantastic, did I ever tell you that?                                          Dalia: Never, not even once.                                                                        Orion: *Pinching her nipples* And your hard nipples give you away – you're horny as fuck...         Dalia: *Giggles* Shut up!                                                                           Orion: But it's true... isn't it?                                                                   Dalia: Perhaps.                                                                                     Orion: I want to cum on your pretty face, Dalia...                                                  Dalia: . . .  Cum in my mouth...                                                                    Orion: I'm sorry, what did you just say?                                                            Dalia: Cum in my mouth.                                                                             Orion: Would you like that, you pervert? Are you hungry for some cum?                               Dalia: Please... I want you to release your seed in my little mouth... *Whispering* All of it...    Pretty please... Haven't I done such a good job?                                                    Orion: (Oh my god...) Open up for me, babe...                                                       Slightly opens her mouth to let your dick in.                                                       Orion: Oh, yeah, that's it...                                                                       Dalia: Mmm...                                                                                       Orion: Ahh... (Her lips wrap around me like a second skin...) Oh god, go faster, Dalia... Take it   all in... AAagh... yeah...!                                                                         Dalia: Mmmph... mmmph... mmph...                                                                    Orion: Oh yeah... You want it so bad, don’t you?                                                    Dalia: *Moaning* Mmmmh...                                                                           Orion: You drive me crazy when you look me in the eyes like that...                                 Dalia: Mmmm...                                                                                      Orion: F-Fuck, I'm gonna cum so much... Are you sure you can take it?                               Dalia: Mm-hmmm....                                                                                  Orion: *Grabbing her head with both hands and taking control of her movement* AAaahhh... fuck! Oh... D-Dalia... (Holy shit, I can feel the back of her throat with each thrust...) Oh god, I'm          cumming... I'm cumming!!! *Burying your cock balls-deep into Dalia's mouth* AAAAAArgh...!           Dalia: Gggh...! Ghhhh....                                                                           Orion: *Still cumming* Aaahhh... Jesus fucking Christ... I came like a horse... Are you okay?       Dalia: . . . *Swallows* Mm-hm...                                                                    Orion: Good girl...                                                                                 Dalia: *Wipes off her mouth* God... Strangely, it tastes exactly like I thought it would...         Orion: Well, well, well... so you openly admit having fantasized about how my cum tastes, huh...?   Dalia: Oh, shut up!                                                                                 Orion: But seriously though, that was... unbelievable!                                              Dalia: By the amount of... jizz you just dropped in my tummy, I could tell you enjoyed it, yeah.    Orion: My god, Dalia. You can add this to your list of talents.                                     Dalia: *Chuckles* Oh, yeah, it'd look very good on my resume.                                       Orion: *Laughs* I'd hire you if that was part of the interview process.                             Dalia: Anyway, this was... entertaining... but we’ve gotta go now. I'd leave you here to recover,   but this is still my private server! No one can be here without me.                                 Orion: No worries, I have no interest in coming to this server if you're not on it...               Dalia: Thank you... Well okay, let's go. I wanna go for a run before having dinner.                 Orion: Running? Didn't you just come back from the competition?!                                    Dalia: *Standing up* I’ve gotta start training NOW if I want to beat Micaela next year! No one's    gonna stop me!                                                                                      Orion: Hell yeah! (I'm glad she regained confidence in herself. God, that ass, though. I need to see that bouncing on top of me one day...) You know, this was one of the best experiences of my life.  We should definitely do this again sometime.                                                        Dalia: Never gonna happen again.                                                                    Orion: You wanna bet? I could return the favor this time...                                         Dalia: I'm not making any bets with you ever again either.                                          Orion: Aw...                                                                                        Dalia: And if you talk about what happened here with anyone after we leave this server, I'll murder you. I swear to god, I'll do it. I'm not kidding.                                                   Orion: I'll k-keep that in mind. Can I at least hold onto it in my memories?                        Dalia: Um... Okay, but make it a hazy memory.                                                       Orion: *Chuckles* Fair enough. Hmmm... (This fucking bed is way too hard to sleep on... I’ve gotta  ask Nancy to change the mattress. Hmm? Since when do I have a...) *Sitting up* (What the fuck... Why am I naked? This table is freezing! I feel like my balls are gonna get stuck to it!) *Reading the  blackboard* (Corpse #1, brain. Corpse #2, heart and wounds. Cadaveric state... Hmm? Wait, is this   a...) *Hyperventilating* (O-Okay, what the hell is going on... T-That's a corpse! Why the fuck am I in a morgue?! Am I supposed to be "corpse #1"?!) *Hyperventilating* (Okay, calm down, Orion. I'm    sure all this has a perfectly logical explanation. I must be spending too much time on Eternum’s    horror servers, that's all. What's the last thing I remember? Think... I had some dinner, I went to sleep... Then I woke up and...) F-FUCK!!!                                                           Lady: Will you help us?                                                                             Orion: W-What?! Who the hell are you?!                                                              Lady: The love of your life is about to die.                                                        Orion: W-What?                                                                                      Lady: In front of you, there is a button. If you press it, there is a 1-in-7 chance to save her     life. However, there is also a 6-in-7 chance that pressing the button will kill you. Do you press   the button?                                                                                         Orion: What the fuck are you talking about...                                                       Lady: Do you press the button?                                                                      Orion: Where am I?!                                                                                 Lady: Do you press the button?                                                                      Orion: . . .                                                                                        Yes                                                                                                 Orion: I g-guess.                                                                                   Lady: Why?                                                                                          Orion: Why? Well... Even if I might die... There's still a chance, isn't there? I'd do anything to  protect the woman I love. Knowing that I had even the smallest chance to save her, and not trying... I’d probably hate myself for the rest of my life.                                                  No                                                                                                  Orion: I g-guess not.                                                                               Lady: Why?                                                                                          Orion: Why? Well... there’s mathematically an... 86% chance I'll die if I press that button. There’s only a 14% chance of us both living. What's the point of both of us dying? I’m sure she wouldn’t   want me to sacrifice myself for her sake.                                                           Lady: . . .                                                                                         Professor Keating: Orion.                                                                           Orion: What?                                                                                        Professor Keating: Orion!                                                                           Orion: What the... I'd press the button, yes! I wouldn't press the button, of course not! PLEASE! . . . . . . Oh... uh... Hi, Mr. Keating.                                                              Professor Keating: It's the second time you’ve fallen asleep in one of my classes, Orion! All your  classmates have already left.                                                                       Orion: I'm so sorry professor, it's just that... I haven't been sleeping that well lately. (Jeez,   what a terrible nightmare...)                                                                       Professor Keating: You're part of the student exchange program at Kredon, Orion. Sleeping in class  is not the behavior we expect or will tolerate from you. You're supposed to set an example for the  rest of the students.                                                                               Orion: I... know, Mr. Keating.                                                                      Professor Keating: Between the incident with Axel, and your naps in class, I think I’ll have to     seriously consider probationary measures for you. If this continues to happen, you’ll leave me with no choice but to call your former school and take more drastic measures. It doesn’t matter how good your grades are.                                                                                    Orion: It won't happen again, Professor! I promise!                                                 Professor Keating: *Sighs* I hope that's true. Now get out of here, I'm locking the door. And start studying for next week's exam!                                                                      Orion: I will! Thank you! (Honestly, he’s probably right... I should start sleeping earlier. I'm    sleepy all day long. Although... to be fair, Mr. Keating's "Linear Algebra" class wasn't exactly    gripping. I taught myself that long ago.)                                                           Your phone beeps.                                                                                   Orion: Hmm? (Oh damn, that’s a lot of messages. I should probably answer some of them.)             Alex                                                                                                Orion: (Hmm... Tomorrow's the big day. Everyone’s counting on me. Not to mention all the big Ulysses power players being there: William Bardot, the other major shareholders, Idriel, the Founder... oh crap, probably even Thanatos? But I’ve gotta use this chance to obtain as much info as I can. I     can’t just rely on Alex, I need to be ready too!)                                                   Dalia                                                                                               Orion: (I was worried she’d be awkward around me after last week’s competition, but it doesn’t seem like it. She has the same silly humor as me. She has the same silly humor as me. Oops, I think I was a little too rude there. Bah, who cares. She's the one who started making fun of me. Damn, she's   still really angry. You really blew it this time, Orion.)                                           Penelope                                                                                            Orion: (Damn, those photos were amazing. I wonder if she'll post them... or if she just wanted to   show them to me...)                                                                                 Nova                                                                                                Orion: (Hmmm... That was... strange. I wonder what she's up to... But it's funny to see how, after  all her life without a phone, she's totally hooked to it now.)                                      Luna                                                                                                Orion: (Day of the Dead, huh... That sounds pretty cool! I wonder if she’ll dress up? I'll write    that date down on my calendar. I can't miss it! Hmm... She didn't reply. Luna’s just as closed-off  as when we first met. She's always so nice, though. Maybe she just needs more time... I'm sure we   can be good friends.)                                                                               Nancy                                                                                               Orion: (Damn, at this rate, the whole server will be hers in a matter of weeks. Maybe we’ll all be  calling Nancy the Queen of Eternum soon? That bikini though... sexy as hell.)                       Chang Put your phone away                                                                           Orion: (Bah, I'll answer later. I don't have the time right now. Okay, finally! That was all. I'm   not looking at my phone again until the masquerade party! Alright... Time to go home. I have a date with a very special someone today, and I don't want to keep her waiting too long... I guess I don't have too much to do before tomorrow night, then.) *Yawns* (That's what I call a quiet week. I       haven't done shit yet and we're on Friday already. I'll go home and do some research before the     event. And maybe I can log into a shopping mall server in Eternum and buy myself a nice suit... Of  course. The rain just HAS to stop once I get home and get ready for an Eternum gaming marathon...   This bloody weather... Anyways, I should probably find Annie. I haven't seen her around, though.    Isn’t she home yet?) *Yelling* AN–                                                                  Annie: Good eveNING!!!                                                                              Orion: *Laughs* Were you waiting on the other side of the door, or what?                            Annie: O-Of course not! I was just, like, casually passin' through and remembered... Well, today    we're supposed to... I don't know if you remember...?                                               Orion: Of course I remember! Today we're going on a date, young lady.                               Annie: (Oh my god, he remembered! I was afraid he'd forget, but he didn't! I'm going on a date with Orion!)                                                                                             Orion: So... Are you ready?                                                                         Annie: Yes, I am!                                                                                   Orion: Hey, did you do something different with your hair? It looks longer.                         Annie: My hair? Oh well, yeah, I haven’t gotten my hair cut since we arrived in Kredon... Y-You     mentioned that I looked good with long hair in Eternum, so I thought of letting it grow a bit in the real world too.                                                                                    Orion: Cool! You look beautiful.                                                                    Annie: T-Thanks. (Oh my god, he noticed! And he also said he likes it! I should let my hair grow as much as in Eternum! Maybe extensions...?)                                                           Orion: Uh... Okay, so about this "date"...                                                          Annie: Yes! Did you have something in mind?                                                         Orion: I do! Do you know the Andromeda server?                                                      Annie: Of course! It’s the biggest server in Eternum!                                               Orion: Well, I found a little planet where there's some kind of space-resort designed for couples. I took a look and there are a lot of activities and services, like theaters and Zero-G rooms. It     looks pretty fun!                                                                                   Annie: What? That probably costs a lot of money! I can't accept that!                               Orion: I knew you'd say that! First of all, when I first played Eternum, you gifted me all the      eternals you had saved up – so you have no right to be mad about this! Oh, and I’m gonna pay all    that back as soon as I have the money or a really valuable item, so don't think I've forgotten about it!                                                                                                Annie: Hey, that doesn't count!                                                                     Orion: And second of all, they have a deal right now where new players can bring a date and try some facilities for four hours without charge. And it’s only been about a month, so I just barely meet  the cutoff! So... it’s totally free, and you have no excuse!                                        Annie: Oh, in that case... okay! Let's do it! (Oh my god, a date in Eternum! A date with Orion! A   date in Eternum WITH Orion! All my dreams are coming true!)                                         Orion: *Chuckles* I think you're getting too excited about this, Annie. You need to relax. You'll   enjoy it more if you take it less seriously!                                                        Annie: Too excited? Me? Where did you get that from? I'm like... super chill! Chillin’ like a       villain on penicillin, bro! Gonna play some Eternum with ma' homie... Just vibin' in a space server y'know? No biggie!                                                                                  Orion: *Laughs* You're right! It's obvious that you're super relaxed. Sorry, I was clearly mistaken! Alright then, I'll log in first and send you an invitation!                                        Annie: Okay! I'll put my E-suit on!                                                                 Orion: (Maybe not as much as Annie, but I'm pretty nervous too.) *Jumping on the bed* (I read about this place on an Eternum forum, but I haven’t visited yet.) *Putting the E-suit on* (I hope it's as good as the posts claim.)                                                                           Connected. Welcome back to Eternum. You do not have any server invitations.                         Orion: I want to join the Andromeda server. I should have access to the Exit Portal number... L-768.Please prepare to connect...                                                                        Orion: *Taking a deep breath* (Ahh... this feeling of discovery again... I missed it! I guess this  is where they receive customers. So far, so good! It feels elegant and intimate... and futuristic as fuck! Okay... Now I have to send an invitation to Annie... I'm usually the one receiving the       invitations, so... I hope I got this right. Send invitation... to... Annie Winters. And done. It'll probably take her a few– –Or maybe not.)                                                            Annie: *Pressing herself up against the glass* Whoaaaa! Look at this! It's like an endless ocean!   Amazing... Most planets in this server are basically deserts...                                     Orion: Annie? Is that you?                                                                          Annie: Hi!                                                                                          Orion: Wow! You look so different!                                                                  Annie: Oh w-well, yeah, I went to buy a couple of things yesterday for the non-combat servers and I also got a new haircut option for Eternum... Nothing too special...                                 Orion: You look stunning!                                                                           Annie: T-Thanks! You look good too!                                                                 Orion: Thank you! I didn't really know what to wear in a server like this, but in the ad they said  "casual outfit", so I just went with it.                                                            Annie: Yeah, in Andromeda, you can find all kinds of different scenarios. Eternum could consist of  just this server, and it'd still be unfathomable!                                                   AstroCorp employee: Greetings! Welcome to AstroCorp, the best way to forge a bond with your loved   ones since 2022. I'm Maria, and I'll introduce you to the systems before sending you out on your    adventure.                                                                                          Annie: Hi! Thank you for welcoming us in.                                                           AstroCorp employee: No, thank you and your beloved for choosing Astrocorp.                          Annie: W-Well, we're not a c-couple. I mean, n-not yet. I mean... not that I want to... N-Not that I don't want to...! We're just having a date. But not like... I mean...                              AstroCorp employee: *Chuckles* Don't worry. What's important is that you came here with someone you care about. That’s all that matters. For any kind of date you have in mind, we hope you consider    Astrocorp as your first option. Astrocorp prides itself on its adaptability, as well. We’ve recently even begun catering experiences for polyamorous relationships, if that was something you were      interested in...                                                                                    Orion: Uh... that’s not exactly what we’re looking for right now...! Let’s stick with the original  plan...                                                                                             AstroCorp employee: Please let me know if your plans change, it would be our pleasure to help. Our  company has opened several new branches all over this server, and we have been operating on this    planet almost since Eternum's launch. Are you familiar with the Andromeda server?                   Annie: I like to play here sometimes, but it's the first time Orion has been here.                  AstroCorp employee: You couldn't have come to a better place, then. Would you like to know more     about Andromeda?                                                                                    Sure                                                                                                Orion: Sure! It's always fascinating to learn more about this world.                                AstroCorp employee: Andromeda holds the record for being the biggest server in Eternum. It is       estimated that there are more than 30,000 star systems, each one with its unique set of orbiting    planets. Most of them are completely uninhabited, but no two are alike. There are no borders or     boundaries located anywhere in the server, and thanks to the FTL Space Launchers, space exploration is only limited by your imagination and effort. However, most players are typically concentrated in the space stations located in the asteroid belt of Kalanar. Planets have no owners, so you're free  to build your base or colonize a settlement as long as you have the necessary resources.            Orion: Wow, that sounds... massive. And who's running this server? Who designed it?                 AstroCorp employee: Andromeda was released alongside Eternum, and it has been constantly expanding  since then. It was one of the initial promotional servers. The Founder and his team were            instrumental in Andromeda’s development.                                                            Orion: Uh... yeah, that's really impressive.                                                        AstroCorp employee: We're located here, on Nox 7 – one of the two planets orbiting the white dwarf  star Zheta-A. While the other planetoid is nothing but a wasteland of empty caverns, Nox 7 is one of the more bustling planets in this quadrant. More than 25,000 players drop by everyday! I suggest   you pay a visit when you get the chance.                                                            Orion: That's... simply astonishing. Thank you!                                                     No                                                                                                  Orion: Nah, you can spare me the history lesson, thank you.                                         AstroCorp employee: Alright then. We're all set. The one-day package for the free trial visitors    includes access to all of our facilities until 11 PM. If you need any assistance, please feel free  to ask me or any of my colleagues. Thank you again for choosing Astrocorp. I'm pleased to welcome   you to the ultimate experience of love... Annie... Orion... Falazio.                                Falazio: Um... I'm not sure I understood what you meant with your speech. I-Isn't this a dating     service?                                                                                            AstroCorp employee: Not exactly. Our service is aimed at either new or long-established             relationships. Here you can find numerous activities to make your date an unforgettable experience. Falazio: Uhh... so... no meeting singles here?                                                      AstroCorp employee: I'm afraid all our clients already come here with a partner.                    Falazio: Uhhh... I think I read the ad wrong. C-Can I get my money back?                            AstroCorp employee: No.                                                                             Falazio: Oof...                                                                                     AstroCorp employee: However, you can still use facilities anyway. We offer an excellent selection of muffins in the canteen. They are simply... out of this world.                                      Falazio: Oh... oh! That doesn't sound that bad! Let's see those muffins!                            AstroCorp employee: Please follow me. You can use our teleporter to get to the station in a matter  of seconds.                                                                                         Orion: A teleporter?                                                                                AstroCorp employee: The Astrocorp Experience takes place in a space station in orbit, 250 miles away from the surface of Nox 7. This is just the Entrance Hall.                                         Orion: So it's like a portal? I’ve been in way too many of these recently...                        Annie: Ahh! I see it! I can see the space station from here!                                        Orion: What? Where?                                                                                 Annie: Right there! Between the clouds!                                                             Orion: *Narrowing your eyes* ...I don't see anything.                                               Falazio: Oh, it's true! I can see it too!                                                           Orion: Are you messing with me?!                                                                    AstroCorp employee: The teleporter will break down all of your molecules into atoms, and recombine  them again in your designated cabin.                                                                Orion: That sounds... painful.                                                                      Annie: Let's break those molecules, Orion!                                                          Orion: *Chuckles* I’ve gotta say, your enthusiasm is contagious.                                    Annie: That's because I’m really thrilled about this! I’m having so much fun, and we haven't even   started yet!                                                                                        Orion: Can't wait to see the views from the space station. I've heard they're incredible.           Annie: This was a great date idea, Orion. Thank you for inviting me!                                Orion: Okay, that's it, you're forbidden from saying "thank you" again until the date is over!      Annie: *Giggles* Okay, okay, sorry!                                                                 Orion: Alright, time to break down some molecules.                                                  Annie: Let's hope our atoms don't get lost along the way!                                           Orion: Hey, nothing ventured, nothing gained.                                                       Annie: That's my personal philosophy! Like I said to you when we first played Eternum on Ion...     Take the leap of faith!                                                                             Orion: Take the leap of faith!                                                                      Annie: That's the one! Come on Orion, take the leap of faith!                                       Let's get this shit done!                                                                           Orion: Let's get this shit done!                                                                    Annie: *Laughs* I didn't say that, but that's also a good quote! Let's get this shit done!          Nothing ventured, nothing gained!                                                                   Orion: Nothing ventured, nothing gained!                                                            Annie: *Laughs* You just said that right now! That's also a good quote though. Nothing ventured,    nothing gained!                                                                                     Orion: *Putting yourself in front of the strange device* Okay, sooo... How does this thing work?    AstroCorp employee: Just stay right there, and try not to move. Remember that this is a one-way     trip. You'll have to use the teleporter in the station hangar, or use a transport ship to return to the surface, and use the Exit Portal here.                                                          Orion: Gotcha.                                                                                      AstroCorp employee: Molecular breakage in 3...                                                      Orion: Um... i-is this itching I'm feeling normal?                                                  AstroCorp employee: 2...                                                                            Orion: M-Maria?                                                                                     AstroCorp employee: 1...                                                                            Orion: AHHHHHH! Jesus! My... molecules!                                                             Annie: Wow...                                                                                       Orion: Huh?                                                                                         Annie: Look at all these comets! There are a lot of them! Quick, Orion, make a wish!                Orion: I want a hundred wishes!                                                                     Annie: *Laughs* That's not allowed!                                                                 Orion: It is! I read Andromeda's wishing rules. I’m an expert now.                                  Annie: *Laughs* Oh, now you know more about this server than I do?                                  Orion: *Chuckles* Nah, probably not. Only about its wishing rules. I’m guessing you’ve spent        hundreds of hours here.                                                                             Annie: Nah, not really! It's an awesome server, but it almost feels too big for me. And well, you   really need your own spaceship to move freely in a server like this, and they're egregiously        expensive!                                                                                          Orion: (Note to self: buy Annie a spaceship to repay her for that initial Eternum gift.)            Annie: The cheapest ones cost between $500,000 and $700,000.                                        Orion: (Note to self: disregard previous note.)                                                     Annie: I'll get one someday!                                                                        Orion: I'm sure of it! Alright then, let's explore this romantic station, shall we?                 Annie: *Giggles* S-Sure!                                                                            Player: Thank you so much, Katniss!                                                                 AstroCorp employee: Hello, couple! Welcome to the USCSS Icarus, the most romantic station in all of Eternum! My name is Katniss, nice to meet you. How may I help you today?                            Orion: Hi Katniss! I’m Orion and this is Annie. It's our first time here, what would you recommend? AstroCorp employee: Ah, if it's your first time at Astrocorp, I'd suggest that you try the Zero-G   room. It's a unique experience that no one should miss! There's a bit of a queue, but I can make a  reservation under your name 3 hours from now.                                                       Orion: Sure! Let's do it.                                                                           AstroCorp employee: And... while you wait... I'd suggest you check out our cinemas! We have two     movies available today, Interstellar and Hot Tub Time Machine 2. After the Zero-G experience, you   can also visit our 4D bowling lanes, or try the ice rink. And to finish up your date, you must go to the Planetarium! You can see all the corners of Andromeda from there.                              Orion: That all sounds awesome! Thank you very much!                                                AstroCorp employee: And lastly, please note that you can find flyers with all the available         activities in your cabin.                                                                           Orion: Perfect. What do you say, Annie?                                                             Annie: I'm all for it! Everything sounds really fun.                                                Orion: Let's start with a movie, then. What do you wanna see?                                       Annie: I don't mind! I haven't seen either of the movies she said, so it's your choice!             Orion: Any preference?                                                                              Annie: Nope! Not at all. Your call!                                                                 Interstellar                                                                                        Orion: Let's watch Interstellar. It's one of my favorite movies, and I know you haven't seen it yet. With how much you love sci-fi, I'm sure you'll like it too!                                        Hot Tub Time Machine 2                                                                              Orion: Let's watch Hot Tub Time Machine 2... whatever that is. I've already seen the other movie, so at least by going to this one we both can see something new.                                       Annie: That sounds good! Lead the way!                                                              Orion: Damn, these views are amazing wherever you look.                                             Annie: Right?                                                                                       Orion: We definitely have to take one of those spaceships back to Astrocorp's Exit Portal. No way   I’m using another teleporter!                                                                       Annie: Do you know how to fly those things?                                                         Orion: Oh please, I'm not only a cunning warrior, but also the best star-pilot in the galaxy.       Annie: *Laughs* Alright, I trust you, Anakin! Ohh! It's awesome! Where should we sit?! In the       middle? I like to sit in the middle!                                                                Orion: Actually, I typically prefer the rear... But it looks like those are reserved, so the middle sounds good!                                                                                        Annie: Look at those speakers! They're huge!                                                        Orion: Yeah, I read that the sound is spectacular. And the real 3D image makes it super immersive.  Annie: Wow... Can't wait to see it!                                                                 Orion: I'll go get some popcorn. What do you want?                                                  Annie: Um... A XXL Bowl and a coke!                                                                 Orion: Got it! Go get a good seat, I'll be right back.                                              Annie: Understood! Don't be long!                                                                   Orion: (I've seen this movie like 4 times already, and I never get tired of it. One of the best     sci-fi movies of all time, no doubt. Jesus Christ, this has to be the worst sci-fi movie I've ever  seen... It's unwatchable.) *Looking at the other people in the theater*                             Players: *Making out*                                                                               Player: Do you know who the hottest person in this entire star system is?

Orion: *Smiles*                                                                                     Annie: Zzzzz...

Annie: *Talking in her sleep* It's two days until my date with Orion... *Talking in her sleep* I’ve gotta buy me a new pair of boots... Zzzzz...                                                        Orion: *Smiles*                                                                                     Player: Where do you wanna go now?

Orion: Are you okay, Annie?                                                                         Annie: *Sobbing* Y-Yeah, it's just that... *Sobbing* The m-movie moved me a little, I'm sorry.      Orion: You didn't like it, then?                                                                    Annie: What?! NO! Of course I did! That was like... the BEST movie I've ever seen!                  Orion: *Chuckles* Really?                                                                           Annie: Yeah! I plan to watch it again as soon as we're back in the real world! T-The acting, the    cinematography, the epicness, the feels, the MUSIC! I loved it all!                                 Orion: I'm glad to hear that! It's one of my favorites too. I think all the Astrocorp features      really added to the experience!                                                                     Annie: I can see why! I remember you talking about it, but I never got the chance to see it until   now. WHAT ELSE HAVE I BEEN MISSING?!                                                                Orion: Well, this was just the beginning! I, for one, am looking forward to that Zero-G experience. Annie: OH MY GOD, I FELL ASLEEP! I FELL ASLEEP during my date with Orion! I've ruined it! *Sobbing* I've ruined it forever...                                                                           Orion: You haven't ruined anything! Let me guess, you didn't sleep last night, did you?             Annie: I... H-How do you know?                                                                      Orion: Because I know you. You needed a little nap. And hell, I think I zoned out during some parts of that movie too. It was terrible! No one can blame you. So no more sad faces! Can you promise me  that?                                                                                               Annie: O-Okay! I promise!                                                                           Orion: Excellent! And now... I don't know about you, but I'm gonna go try out that Zero-G room. I'm looking forward to it.                                                                              Annie: Ah, true! Is it time already?                                                                Orion: Yep! And I think it's at the other side of the station, so we’d better hurry!                Annie: I can't wait! Let's go!                                                                      Orion: Alright, cabin 17! Here's where we have to get changed.                                      Annie: Awesome!                                                                                     Orion: It's...! I-Isn't it a bit... grimy? Looks like a pigsty...                                   AstroCorp employee: Hello guys!                                                                     Orion: I m-mean... this is awesome! Very clean!                                                     AstroCorp employee: I know about the mess... I'm so sorry. Claire, our cleaning lady, is currently  in the infirmary. She started feeling poorly all of a sudden. We thought it was just a little       dizziness, but if it keeps up, she’ll have to go back to Nox 7 and log off for the day.             Unfortunately, we have no replacement for her, and with the rest of the staff being on strike... the dressing rooms are in terrible shape. We've been forced to temporarily use the employees' cabins as alternatives...                                                                                    Orion: No problem at all, seriously. I know what it's like to be an employee at a big company. My   last summer job was not... the best experience, to say the least.                                   AstroCorp employee: Thank you for understanding! You can find Zero-G suits of all sizes in the      closet. Please remember to use the tightest fit possible. As soon as you've changed, you can follow the corridor on the right to the Zero-G room. The entire space is reserved for you two for a period of 15 minutes.                                                                                      Orion: Only 15 minutes?                                                                             AstroCorp employee: I'm afraid so. The Zero-G room is in high demand.                               Orion: Understandable. Well, 15 minutes are better than nothing.                                    AstroCorp employee: Please call me if you need anything else.                                       Orion: We will. Thank you!                                                                          Annie: I'm so excited!                                                                              Orion: I was expecting a little more time, to be honest.                                            Annie: Well, I guess everyone wants to try it out, so they have to speed the whole process up.      Orion: Yeah, you're probably right. That makes sense. Alright then, let's get changed!              Annie: Yeah! . . .                                                                                  Orion: . . .                                                                                        Annie: Um... C-Can you look the other way, please?                                                  Orion: *Turning around* Oh... o-of course! (I feel so comfortable with Annie that sometimes I forget we're not really... a couple. I mean... of course we're not. We haven't even... What happened the  other day was something out of the ordinary.) *Clears throat* Uh... Can you pass me one of those    suits?                                                                                              Annie: Of course! Which size?                                                                       Orion: The lady said it has to be tight, so... I guess S or M.                                      Annie: There you go!                                                                                Orion: Thanks! *Putting the new clothes on* You're not staring at my butt while I'm getting changed, are you?                                                                                           Annie: *Laughs* Of course not!                                                                      Orion: *Chuckles* A likely story, Ms. Winters... I'll believe you, for now...                       Annie: Alright, I think I'm ready!                                                                  Orion: *Turning around* I am too. (Whoa, Annie's ass really looks like a peach in this...)          Annie: *Giggles* This thing feels... kinda weird, doesn't it?                                       Orion: (Damn... This suit is skin-tight... I can see every single curve of Annie's petite body. Her stature and complexion make her seem fragile and vulnerable, but... oh boy, those hips say something else...) Ehh... yeah, I know! This fabric feels glued on!                                          Annie: Yeah, but it's not uncomfortable!                                                            Orion: True. It looks like it's made with some kind of waterproof plastic, but the inside is a      softer, more foam-like material.                                                                    Annie: It's probably designed for maximum comfort in zero gravity.                                  Orion: Probably. There's only one way to find out!                                                  Annie: Let's go! Whoa! This room is bigger than I thought!                                          PA system: Artificial gravity disabled.                                                             Orion: Hmm? Already?                                                                                Annie: Hmm... I don't feel anything different. Are we really in Zero-G already?                     Orion: *Standing on your toes* I don't think so.                                                    Annie: Maybe we have to jump onto this structure.                                                   Orion: It's worth a try.                                                                            Annie: *Jumps* W-Whoa! Oh my god, I c-can't stop! W-WOW! *Laughs* This is amazing! I'm floating!    There's no gravity!                                                                                 Orion: Wow, it looks like you're flying...                                                          Annie: Come here, Orion! Jump!                                                                      Orion: H-Holy shit! This is super cool!                                                             Annie: Right? It feels like scuba diving in the air!                                                Orion: Have you ever done any scuba diving?                                                         Annie: *Laughs* No, but this is how I imagined it'd feel, only with more... water! Let's have a race to the wall and back!                                                                              Orion: You have no chance! God... this feels so relaxing... I can move my arms and legs without any effort... I think I could even fall asleep in any position! Right, Annie? (Ah, looks like Annie fell asleep already.) Annie, you awake? I can go call the Astrocorp employee if we’re ready to wrap this up.                                                                                                Annie: *Laughs* I'm not sleeping! I'm just trying to relax and vibe with the cosmos!                Orion: *Chuckles* Oh, so mystical... I like it.                                                     Annie: And I was also thinking about... how happy I am to be here with you. You and Chang have      always been my best friends, and neither of you played Eternum until recently, so... I've always    felt kind of alone here. For years, I kept a mental list of all the things I wanted to show you in  this world, once you could join me. And now... well, I don't have to imagine it anymore! You're     here!                                                                                               Orion: You’re the one who’s really made these first few weeks in Eternum worthwhile, Annie. I       couldn't have asked for anyone better to spend time with.                                           Annie: Likewise!                                                                                    About Eternum...                                                                                    Orion: You know... Just a month ago, if you told me that I’d be floating at a space station orbiting some planet in a new galaxy... I would've laughed you out of the room. The things you can do in    Eternum are just... incomprehensible.                                                               Annie: Right?! There's never a single session where I’m fully prepared. There’s always something    unexpected just around the corner! You can do magic, transform your body, become super strong, turn invisible, dine at luxurious restaurants! You can even sleep or get drunk! Anything and everything  you can do in the real world... but enhanced! It gets harder and harder to log off every single     time! In fact, I've even heard of psychiatric Eternum studies where people... Wait, why are you     laughing?                                                                                           Orion: Get drunk, huh? I didn't know you were an Eternum drunkard...                                Annie: *Laughs* I'm not! You know I don't like alcohol.                                             Orion: *Chuckles* I know. I don't usually drink either. Except... maybe at parties.                 Annie: Yeah, I guess that makes sense... I don't remember you going to many parties, though.        Orion: Actually, I'm going to one next week! Penelope invited me to a costume party at her campus. I think Nova will be there too.                                                                      Annie: Whoa! A costume party! That's pretty cool! What are you going as?                            Orion: Hmm... I still haven't thought about it, to be honest. Any ideas?                            Annie: Um... Let me think... You could disguise yourself as a character from a show or movie you    like... maybe an animal... or a superhero. Oh, you could also dress up as someone famous! I guess it also depends on whether you want to cover your face or not... and how much you're willing to       spend!                                                                                              Orion: Hmmm... a few things come to mind... I'll let you know once I've decided!                    Annie: Can't wait!                                                                                  Orion: Yeah, you're not wrong. I usually prefer to do other things. Like hanging out in Eternum!    Annie: That makes two of us!                                                                        About our mission...                                                                                Orion: It feels good to have some quiet time for once. The Gems of Doom, the Weapons of Atlas,      Calypso, Benjamin’s excommunication, Thanatos... Everything has happened in... what? Less than a    month?                                                                                              Annie: I know... it's been crazy. I still can't believe we... well, you were invited to a dinner in the Rockefeller server with Ulysses' big shots. Are you nervous about it?                           Orion: Well... Maybe a bit. I don't know who I'm going to see there.                                Annie: And... are you afraid of seeing Thanatos again? I definitely would be!                       Orion: No, not really... it's a non-combat area and, to be honest, he doesn't strike me as the kind of guy who would accept an invitation to a dinner with a bunch of rich dudes. I doubt he's going to be there.                                                                                           Annie: But he's trying to gather the 10 Gems, isn't he? His objective is the same as everyone       else’s, to become the new CEO of Ulysses. So, in a certain sense, his goal is to become one of those rich dudes himself, in the end.                                                                    Orion: Huh. You have a point there... The people there have got to know more about Eternum than     anyone else in the world. I'll try to gather some information about everything, but... I want to be careful about whom I speak with. It could be dangerous. I'm glad Alex is coming with me. She’ll be  way more comfortable around those shady bigwigs than I am.                                          Annie: Yeah, me too! I haven't talked much with her, but she seems cool! The other day I saw her    riding her bike – she looked so badass! I waved to her, but she didn't see me...                    Orion: Were you behind a fire hydrant? That'd explain it.                                           Annie: *Laughs* Don't make fun of me! I'm not that short!                                           Orion: *Laughs* If you say so... Did I tell you that Bennie Garrington thought that a child had     attacked him at first?                                                                              Annie: WHAT? You’ve gotta be kidding... He needs better glasses!                                    About Kredon...                                                                                     Orion: So... How's life in Kredon so far?                                                           Annie: It's great! You were right, it's a rather small town, but there's everything you need! And I felt super welcome in our new home! Nancy, Penelope, and Dalia are all very nice to me. They treat  me as one of the family. You know I’ve always wanted sisters, so I really feel like they’re giving  me that experience!                                                                                 Orion: Happy to hear that!                                                                          Annie: And they're all so pretty! I wish I was as beautiful as them...                              Orion: What do you mean? You're just as pretty as any of them! *Chuckles* Honestly, I’m sometimes   more intimidated by all these beautiful women than I am by Thanatos!                                Annie: Well, by "pretty" I mean... You know what I mean!                                            Orion: Hmm... no, not really, no...                                                                 Annie: Agh! You know! I don't have their... Assets.                                                 Orion: Oh! Come on, Annie! You can't be serious! You're precious. I know plenty of men who can      appreciate a petite body just as much as big tits or a big butt. And you can include me on that list as well. Especially if everything is so nicely shaped, as in your case...                          Annie: Oh please, s-shut up! You're gonna make me blush!                                            Orion: *Laughs* You've been blushing for a while now.                                               Annie: I'm not! It's just this suit! It's... too warm.                                              Orion: *Chuckles* Of course!                                                                        Annie: C-Can we change the subject?!                                                                Orion: Hey, it's not me who keeps bringing up Dalia's butt in every conversation! *Chuckles* But    okay, okay... How about the first few weeks at the new school? All good?                            Annie: Yeah! Some of the girls are a bit... unfriendly sometimes, but luckily I have Luna. She's    super nice!                                                                                         Orion: I'm glad you two get along.                                                                  Annie: She's been helping me with my math homework too. She's a great teacher.                      Orion: Nice! Don't hesitate to ask me if you need any extra help with the other subjects. You know  I'm a genius.                                                                                       Annie: *Laughs* Only in what interests you! But sure, I'll remember that, "professor"!              Relax and say nothing                                                                               Orion: Okay, okay, stop talking now! I was trying to relax and vibe with the cosmos before you      interrupted me, you know?                                                                           Annie: *Laughs* That's my line! And you’re the one who started talking!                             Orion: Are you sure? That's not how I rem–                                                          PA system: Session terminated. Restoring artificial gravity. Thank you for choosing the Astrocorp   Experience.                                                                                         Orion: Aww... it went by so fast!                                                                   You slowly start to feel your weight again, as you descend to the ground.                           Orion: Huh, I was getting used to moving my limbs effortlessly. It feels weird to feel their weight again.                                                                                              Annie: S-Sorry! I was trying to get to the wall before falling. But I... couldn't reach it. Y-You   can just leave me on the floor. I don't want to hurt your back.                                     Orion: Hurt my back? I'm pretty sure the bar I use for biceps curls at the gym weighs more than you.Annie: Oh... Well, in that case... take me to my chamber, Sir Orion! We still have lots of things to see! Hurry up!                                                                                     Orion: Hmm, I didn't see that worker from earlier anywhere, I guess we're supposed to leave the     suits where we found them.                                                                          Annie: *Jumps on the bed* Oh my god, Orion! Look at this!                                           Orion: Oh, the stellar nebulae!                                                                     Annie: Do you know anything about them?                                                             Orion: As I understand it, they're like giant clouds of gas and dust in space. Some are literally   hundreds of light-years in diameter!                                                                Annie: Wow... It's like seeing the Northern Lights in outer space!                                  Orion: I know! On the website, they said they could be seen after 10 PM, thanks to the station's    orbit. I was thinking of going to the Planetarium now, but we can save that ‘til the last minute.   Annie: Well, if the nebulae aren’t going anywhere... I'd go there later, yeah. You know... for a    grand finale!                                                                                       Orion: That's what I thought, too! What do you wanna do now, then?                                  Annie: I don't know... all the activities they mentioned sounded really fun! Maybe we should just go for a walk and look around the station. As long as I'm w-with you... I don't really mind...        Orion: That sounds good too! Let's see what we can find. We should probably change back into our    regular clothes now.                                                                                Annie: Yeah, we probably should...                                                                  Orion: Yeah...                                                                                      Annie: . . .                                                                                        Orion: Yeah...                                                                                      Annie: . . . (Why... why am I so uncomfortable with Orion watching me undress? Isn't this what I    wanted? Maybe... it's just not the right time yet...? Why do I have so many doubts? You’ve had a    crush on him for years, Annie! But... something feels like it’s missing... Oh god, now he's looking at you, Annie. Say something!)                                                                      Orion: So...                                                                                        Annie: *Stands up* Y-Yeah! Um... You know... on second thought... I think it'd be better if we went home now. I had so much fun! But... I'm so tired. I haven't slept properly for days. (I... need some time to think...)                                                                                  Orion: Oh... N-No worries! I totally understand. I'm quite tired too... (Why the sudden change? Did I say or do something wrong?)                                                                       Annie: Let's take one of those ships back to Nox 7.                                                 Orion: S-Sure! (Well... That was... weird. Annie hardly said anything on the way back. She looked   lost in her own thoughts the entire trip back to the Exit Portal. All the other customers had       already left, so it was just us and an uncomfortable silence. This date took a wrong turn at some   point, and I don't know what I did wrong. Argh! I wish the real world had a replay button. Maybe I  could have done something differently. Life is just... too complicated. Anyway, I guess I have other things to worry about right now. This can wait. Focus on the mission, Orion! Tomorrow's the day!   Let's go, baby!) *You turn around* Oops, sorry. I'll let you cha–                                   Annie: *Gets up from bed* N-No!                                                                     Orion: What? No? You don't want to change clothes?                                                  Annie: No, not that... I... I want you to look at me this time.                                     Orion: Oh...                                                                                        Agree                                                                                               Orion: Well...                                                                                      Decline and stay as friends                                                                         Orion: Look, Annie... I've been thinking about this whole... "date" for the last couple of days. I  like you, and you're my best friend, you already know that. But... I also feel like we're not meant to be more than that. Things would get awkward if we tried to get together, and our friendship is   too important to risk, for me at least. I just like spending time with you! I... I think we're meant to be friends. Best friends! So... let's just stay like this for now, okay? I just don’t have those feelings for you right now. In the future... who knows? Maybe. But I don’t want to lead you on,    either.                                                                                             Annie: Oh... Of c-course. That's... what I want too. It's just that... sorry, my head has been a    mess lately. I didn't want to misread the...                                                        Orion: No worries! I totally understand. My head has been all over the place too, you know, with all this back and forth... We can have this conversation again after we gather the 10 Gems!            Annie: Sure!                                                                                        Orion: So... to the Planetarium?                                                                    Annie: Um... What if we leave that for another day? The truth is that I'm a little tired.           Orion: Of course! If that’s what you want to do. We'll go back to Nox 7 using one of those ships!   Annie: *Sad chuckle* Sounds fun.                                                                    Orion: *Removing your visor* (Well... Annie looked pretty down on our way back. She looked lost in  her own thoughts the entire trip back to the Exit Portal. All the other customers had already left, so it was just us and an uncomfortable silence... I made the right decision, though. We can't worry about stuff like that right now, things with her would be just... too complicated. I have too many  things on my plate as it is. Maybe everything will change after I become the new CEO of Ulysses!    Focus on the mission, Orion! Tomorrow's the day! Let's go, baby!) If that's what you want...        Annie: I d-do.                                                                                      Orion: In that case, you won't see me complain... There's enough trust between us already, isn't    there?                                                                                              Annie: Y-Yeah... It's been like... 10 years since we first met?                                     Orion: That’s quite a while... No big deal.                                                         Annie: No big deal...                                                                               She removes her bodysuit and lets it slide down her body to the floor.                              Orion: (Wow... I know I already saw her naked that night in my room, but... well, there was barely  any source of light then. Man, she's... stunning.) You're so pretty, Annie...                       Annie: Mm-hm...                                                                                     Orion: (God, she's shaking like a leaf. She’s so precious. She's not even looking me in the eye... I don't think I've seen her so nervous before. And considering it’s Annie, that's saying something.  What could I do to calm her down...?) Annie?                                                        Annie: Hmm?                                                                                         Orion: *You pick her up like she weighs nothing* Hop!                                               Annie: AAAAH! Orion! What are you doing?! I'M NAKED!!                                               Orion: Oh, believe me, I know... I thought that was the idea!                                       Annie: W-Well y-yeah, I know! B-B-But... I mean... G-God, this is so embarrassing...!               Orion: Seeing you undressing just for me was hot as fuck, Annie.                                    Annie: W-Was it?                                                                                    Orion: But you looked way too nervous, so I wanted to calm you down a little.                       Annie: Calm me down?! Y-You grabbed me while I was naked! Like... totally naked! You're touching    my... b-butt! How is that supposed to calm me down?!                                                Orion: Would it help if I got naked too?                                                            Annie: N-No! That'd make things worse!                                                              Orion: *Chuckles* Can I tell you something?                                                         Annie: I... Y-Yes...                                                                                Orion: But I need you to relax first.                                                               Annie: I'm relaxed! I'm super relaxed!                                                              Orion: No, you're not! Let's do something. I want you to look me in the eyes.                       Annie: Y-Your eyes?                                                                                 Orion: Mm-hm...                                                                                     Her eyes make contact with yours. You start to feel her limbs loosening their grip around you.      Orion: I know you're nervous. It's totally normal to be. And you tend to be a jittery girl anyway,  so a little nervousness makes sense here. But... Do you think I'm NOT nervous? I'm super scared too! I mean, in my arms, I'm holding an adorably precious, absolutely gorgeous girl whom I’ve liked for years. We just went on a date on a spaceship hurtling between constellations in the sky! I'm        surprised I'm not weak in the knees yet. I know it's scary to get out of your comfort zone, but... I think we can overcome it together. So let's stop fooling around and cut to the chase: I like you,  and you like me. I want to be with you... in that way.                                              Annie: . . .                                                                                        Orion: That’s how I feel. If you don't feel the same way... we can always go back to where we were a month ago and stay friends! It’ll be a little awkward at first, but our friendship is strong, and I know we’d be back to normal in no time. Is that what you want?                                     Annie: *Shakes her head*                                                                            Orion: I know it's scary to cross this bridge when you're not sure what your partner might want, so let me be clear... I love how open your heart is to others, how sweet and kind you are to people    you’ve just met. I love your adorable blushes, your kind laughs, and... your petite body and curvy  ass. You are so ridiculously pretty, Annie, that I can’t help but want to take our relationship to  the next level. I want to be with you.                                                              Annie: . . .                                                                                        Orion: Is... is that what you want too?                                                             Annie: *Nods her head*                                                                              Orion: *Sighs with relief* I feel so much better now that we're finally speaking clearly, don't you?Annie: *Nods her head*                                                                              Orion: Alright so... can I ask you another question?                                                Annie: *Nods her head*                                                                              Orion: Can I kiss you?                                                                              Annie: *Smiles* *Nods her head*                                                                     She kisses you with a sincere, unrestrained passion. Her legs wrap around you.                      Orion: (Her lips are trembling... but her body isn’t shaking anymore.) Well, after getting all that off my chest, I feel so much better. *Caressing her cheek* I feel like I could never get enough of  you, Annie...                                                                                       Annie: I feel the same way...                                                                       Orion: Must be this place... We have to leave a generous tip when we leave.                         Annie: *Giggles* Definitely! I guess we should leave the room before they need it for someone       else...                                                                                             Orion: Hmm... I'm pretty sure they wouldn’t mind if we stayed for an extra 20 minutes...            Annie: 20 minutes? How much time do you need to change your clothes?                                Orion: Well... I was actually thinking of doing something else while we're here...                  Annie: Oh, really...? What do you have in mind?                                                     Orion: Do you remember our night together in my room?                                               Annie: Remember? You'll probably laugh at me, but... I've been thinking about it all the time.      Orion: Is that so? What have you been thinking about, exactly, Ms. Winters?                         Annie: Well... You know... The sound of the rain against the window... The feeling of your skin     against mine... The heat that you were giving off... Your ragged breaths on the back of my neck...  Orion: Nothing else?                                                                                Annie: *Giggles* Well... And... The feeling of your... cock... between my thighs...                 Orion: (She pronounced "cock" as if she was saying a forbidden word. I love how innocent she is...) You gently spread her legs to expose her pussy.                                                     Orion: (What a sight... I wonder how many people have seen Annie's most intimate part. She seems    like she’d get changed in a corner of the locker room, covered in a towel. The fact that she's      allowing ME to see and do this with her... it turns me on so much...) Did I hear that right? You've been thinking about my cock? Have I been fooled all these years? Innocent, shy Annie is actually a  horny, perverted little girl?                                                                       Annie: *Giggles* Maybe just a bit...                                                                You start massaging her perky breasts and kissing down her neck.                                    Annie: Ahh... *Moans* Oh god...                                                                     Orion: (She's not shaking anymore, but her breaths have quickened. God, there are so many things I  want to do to Annie right now... but it's still Annie. I don't wanna cross any line too fast.)      You're making me so horny, Annie...                                                                 Annie: You too...                                                                                   Orion: Let me take care of you tonight...                                                           Annie: *Gasps*                                                                                      Orion: Is everything okay?                                                                          Annie: Y-Yeah. It's just that... I wasn't expecting...                                              Orion: Oh... I'm sorry, I should have warned you.                                                   Annie: N-No! It's okay! It's what I want... Please, c-continue... Aaahhh...                         Orion: If you want me to stop, just let me know...                                                  Annie: *Soft moan* N-No... It feels nice...                                                         Orion: (Her skin’s so warm and soft... She’s so delicate... And I can feel her starting to get      wet...)                                                                                             Annie: Mmm...                                                                                       You start increasing the speed of your caresses.                                                    Annie: *Moans* Aaahhh... Oh god...                                                                  Orion: Better?                                                                                      Annie: *Moans* Y-Yeah...                                                                            Orion: (Now we're talking... She's starting to let herself go... moving her hips to the rhythm of my fingers... And her lips are now soaked in her own juice...) Can you feel yourself getting wetter?  Annie: Y-Yeah... It feels g-great...                                                                Orion: It'll only get better from here, babe... I just want to make you feel good...                Annie: Aahhhh... Orion... *Moaning* Aaahh...                                                        Orion: Is everything alright?                                                                       Annie: Y-Yes...                                                                                     Orion: I'm gonna put my fingers inside you now... alright?                                          Annie: A-Alright... Do it...                                                                        You slide two fingers inside her.                                                                   Annie: O-O-Ohhh m-my g-god...! *Her hips spasm* Y-You put t-them inside me...                       Orion: Yes I did...                                                                                 Annie: Ahhh...                                                                                      Orion: Do they feel good?                                                                           Annie: Yes, they do...                                                                              Orion: Do you want me to move them?                                                                 Annie: Y-Yes... p-please! O-Ohhh... My... GOD!! This is... aaaAAah...!                              Orion: (Annie's pussy feels so tight, even more than I imagined... But she's so wet that her vagina lets me plunge my fingers in and out with ease...)                                                  Annie: *Panting* Aaaaah... aaahhh! Yeah! P-Please, keep g-going! *Panting* K-Keep going, Orion!     Y-You’re hitting just the... r-right spot!                                                          You start kissing Annie, while your fingers stroke her at the same steady pace.                     Annie: Mmmm.... mmmm.... mmmmmhh!                                                                   Orion: (Her lips always feel so soft... I can feel the soft tickle of her breath, it’s almost synced with her accelerated heartbeat.)                                                                   Annie: *High-pitched moaning* Mmmmmhh...!                                                           Orion: (And her little moans are driving me insane...)                                              Annie: *Squeals* AAAAAHHhh!                                                                         You curve your fingers inside her, changing their positions, and hasten your pace.                  Annie: OH M-MY G-GOD... W-What is going on...?! W-What are you *moans* doooooing to m-me...?        *Squeals* AAAAHHH! Y-You have to stop! S-STOP! Orion! Ahhh... S-Stop! Or I'm g-gonna... p-piss      myself! OH JESUS!                                                                                   Orion: Don't worry, babe... You're not gonna. That sensation is normal – you're about to orgasm.    Have you ever had one before? Touching yourself to your naughty thoughts...? Have you ever made     yourself cum while jilling off in your room by yourself?                                            Annie: W-What? Aaahhhh.... An o-orgasm? I d-don't know...                                           Orion: I guess that answers my question...                                                          Annie: *Panting* Oh g-god... Oh... F-FUCK! Aaaaahhh.... Orion... S-Seriously... p-please... I       d-don't know w-what... AAAaaHHHhh! Orion!!! AAAAAAAARGHGHHHH!! AAAAAAAAHHHHhhh...                   You can feel Annie's thighs squeeze around your hand, as her whole body tightens. Her hips gyrate   back and forth as she orgasms from your ministrations.                                              Annie: *Collapses* Oh my god...                                                                     Orion: How was that, little lady?                                                                   Annie: T-That... That was... indescribable... My god... is this how you feel every time you... do   this?                                                                                               Orion: *Chuckles* More or less...                                                                   You gently pull your fingers out from Annie's insides, completely covered in her own juices.        Annie: *Leaning back* WOW! That was incredible!                                                     Orion: Glad you liked it...                                                                         Annie: "Like" it? It was the best experience of my life!                                            Orion: Nice...                                                                                      Annie: (Oh my god! I can't believe it! Orion made me...  cum!) *Giggles* Hmm? *Gets up* W-What's    that?!                                                                                              Orion: What?                                                                                        Annie: That... BULGE!                                                                               Orion: Oh... well... You turn me on so much, Annie... I'd be lying if I said I wasn’t rock-hard the whole time...                                                                                       Annie: Wow... Can I... Can I see it?                                                                Orion: (Oh fuck yes...) Of course you can see it... After all, you’re responsible for it...         Annie: *Takes off your tights*                                                                      Orion: Much better...                                                                               Annie: . . . My... GOD! That thing is huge! You have such a big dick...!                            Orion: Y-You had already seen it!                                                                   Annie: B-But... I didn't look much at it! That day I was... too nervous! And I only saw it from     between my legs! I didn't know it went that far down...                                             Orion: Well, you have pretty generous hips, so... even if you could only see the tip poking out... I mean...                                                                                            Annie: ...I g-guess that makes sense. . . . Can I... can I touch it? Please?                        Orion: I want you to kill me if I ever say no to that question...                                   Annie grabs your shaft with tenderness.                                                             Orion: Oh, yeah...                                                                                  She starts to slowly move her hand along your penis.                                                Orion: Ohhh... god... (Wow, I wasn't expecting her to take the lead so quickly... I guess she's     finally starting to be comfortable with her own sexuality... Or my cock just made her really        horny...) Oh, Annie... This feels great...                                                          Annie: You made me feel so good with your fingers... You made me c-cum and it felt amazing... I just want to return the favor...                                                                        Orion: You're definitely succeeding at that... That's it, baby... Keep stroking it... AAaahhh...    You’re such a good girl, Annie...                                                                   Annie: Do you want me to go faster?                                                                 Orion: Oh fuck yes, please... Ahhhh...                                                              Annie: L-Like this?                                                                                 Orion: Y-Yeah, just like that...                                                                    Annie: (My god, it REALLY is huge... I could put like 3 hands here and it still wouldn’t cover it   all...) It's t-throbbing so hard!                                                                   Orion: Ahh... I know... (Annie's hands feel so small and soft... but she's squeezing my cock so     fucking hard! It feels amazing...) Aaaahhh... keep going, Annie... Aaahh... FASTER! AAAAAHHhhhh...  Oh, fuck... (Man, I can't believe her thin arm isn't tired yet...) Oh god, that's it... This is     incredible... Aaahh... D-Do you like beating off my cock, Annie?                                    Annie: I-I do...                                                                                    Orion: W-What do you like? Say it... I wanna hear you describe what you’re doing...                 Annie: I... I love beating off your... massive... pulsing... d-dirty cock...                        Orion: AAAaahh, fuck yes...                                                                         Annie: It’s just so big... I don’t want to stop playing with it... C-Can we do this more often? I-I wanna... practice...                                                                                Orion: Yeah, we can... (God... hearing her talk dirty is driving me crazy...) *Panting* F-Fuck, I   won't last much longer, Annie... You're a natural at this...                                        Annie: I want to make you cum, Orion... You were so kind to me...                                   Orion: I'm almost there...                                                                          Cum                                                                                                 Orion: AAAAAAAARGHH! AAAAAaaahhhhhhhh...                                                            Annie: W-Wow! (Look at all that cum shooting out... I made that happen?)                            Grab Annie and put her on top of you                                                                Orion: Bring that tight little pussy of yours over here...                                          Annie: Wait... W-WHAT?! I'M NOT READY! Not yet! I'm not ready yet! I c-can't take all that! I'm not ready yet! I'm not... F-First I have to get myself a-appropriately psyched up f-for...              Orion: It's okay, Annie... I won't force you to do anything you don't want to... I just want to feel your pussy lips again...                                                                           Annie: M-My... lips?                                                                                Orion: Yeah... Like the thighjob in my room, but... *You softly pull Annie's hips towards you* This time... Aahh... you’re in control...                                                                Annie: Aaahh... Oh god, it's so warm... and sticky...                                               Orion: Oh yeah...                                                                                   Annie immediately starts moving her hips back and forth along your cock, her juices spreading all   over you.                                                                                           Annie: *Moaning* AAAahh...                                                                          Orion: Oh Annie... F-Fuck, I love your body... How petite you are, how easy it is to move you along my cock... (God, I'd love to stretch out her tiny pussy...) I want you so bad, Annie... I can’t wait ‘til the day you can finally take this dick... But not yet...                                      Annie: *Moaning* Aaaahh... aaahhh... W-We’ve g-gotta do some practicing b-beforehand, Orion...      Aaahhh... I-I have t-to get ready for you...                                                        Orion: *Panting* Oh g-god, I'm gonna cum... Ahh... I w-was at the edge already... But you’re pushing me over...                                                                                         Annie: T-That sensation... it's coming again... I c-can feel it...                                  Orion: Oh yeah... just a little bit more...                                                         Annie: AAAAaahh... Y-YEAH!                                                                          Orion: I'm almost... AAAAAAAARGHH! AAAAAaaahhhhhhhh...                                              Annie: W-Wow! (Look at all that cum shooting out... I made that happen?)                            Orion: MY GOD! Jesus fucking Christ... that felt... good...                                         Annie: *Lying down next to you* OH MY GOD! This has been... the BEST night of my life!              Orion: Better than our first night together, you think?                                             Annie: Definitely better...                                                                         Orion: (I love feeling her warm body curled up next to me. It feels comfortable... I almost feel... safe.)                                                                                              Annie: This is exactly how I imagined everything would be... no, even better! Everything's been     simply... *Sighs* Perfect...                                                                        Orion: Yeah, I can hardly imagine a better date... And hey, it's not even over yet!                 Annie: I wish we could stay like this forever...                                                    Orion: Me too. It's too bad we have to leave already. Maybe next time, we can visit this server for a longer period of time. At any rate, I'd rather not be here when the Astrocorp lady comes back and sees the mess we made...                                                                            Annie: *Giggles* That's true!                                                                        You both stand up and start getting dressed.                                                       Annie: *Giggles* I hope we don't bump into her when we get out of here!                             Orion: *Chuckles* Yeah, that'd be awkward.                                                          Annie: Where do you wanna go now?                                                                   Orion: Katniss told us there were flyers with all the available activities in that cabin where the  teleporter left us. So... let’s head there first and check it out. We still have some time! I don't know about you, but I need a minute to replenish fluids...                                          Annie: Oh, I saw a hot cocoa dispenser in the canteen! I'll bring you a cup of hot chocolate!       Orion: Sweet! I don't know why it's so cold here, but a hot chocolate would definitely hit the spot.Annie: Wait for me in our room, it'll just be a minute!                                             Orion: You'd better hurry up! I’m counting the seconds until I can see that booty of yours again... Annie: *Giggles* Don't be silly! It won't go anywhere... you know it's only for you...              Orion: That’s my girl...                                                                            Annie: *Putting on her pants* Start thinking about what you wanna do! Be right back!                Orion: On it! Phew... (Boy, that was... AWESOME! I can’t believe things have gotten so hot and heavy with Annie! She's not only cute, but also sexy as hell when she wants to be... Things have worked  out wonderfully so far!) *You finish getting dressed* (But anyway, I should get out of here before  an employee comes back... Let's go back to the cabin.)                                              Annie: *Pours herself a cup of hot chocolate* (I can't believe we did that! That was... amazing! At first I was nervous as hell, but... after he calmed me down, everything felt... like a dream. I     mean... well, of course, we didn't do... everything. Obviously. M-Maybe the next time...? Or...     maybe not... yet. Probably a bad idea. Right? This is a big step... I mean... Am I ready? I think   I'm ready. O-Or maybe not. Am I? Yes. If it's Orion, I feel like I want to. Although... His thing   is... big. And I'm... small. Will I be able to... Never mind, I’ll think about that later.) *Makes a small jump and turns around* (This date is turning out to be the best night of my life! Thanks     Astrocorp!) *Giggles* Hmm? (What's this? Red paint?) W-W-Wha... *Nervous laughter* W-What's this?   F-Falazio? Is t-that you? *Nervous laughter* I d-didn't know there was a show in the canteen        tonight! It's n-not really my thing, though, s-so you c-can s-stop pretending, haha! O-Okay?        PA system: Emergency alert: Unidentified biological agent. Security locks activated. Quarantine     initiated. Please do NOT move from your current location.                                           Orion: (What the hell is going on? Why did the lights go out?)                                      Annie: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!!                                                                         Orion: (*Startled* W-Was that Annie?) ANNIE?! (Fuck, what the hell is happening?! There has to be   some source of light somewhere around here! I can't see shit like this! Is this some sort of        flashlight? Yes! This will do.) H-Holy fuck, it’s even colder than bef-f-fore... And where the hell is everyone?! HELLO? Is anybody there?! (Now that I think about it... I didn’t see anyone on the way here. In fact, I... I haven't actually seen anyone apart from me and Annie for a long time... Where has everyone gone? Is this part of "Astrocorp's Dating Experience"? If it is, I know Annie won't   enjoy it, that's for sure... This shit is even creeping ME out, and she’s way more squeamish...)    HELLO?! *Shivering* (My hands are freezing... I’ve gotta find Annie and get out of here. I hope the canteen is warmer than this hall... What the fuck is going on, man? Where are the other             passengers...? I didn't read anything about an event like this on Astrocorp's website... If it was  some sort of performance, they'd have warned us when we first arrived, right? Not everyone enjoys   this kind of stuff...) *Shivering* (I have to keep walking... Is that what I think it is? A whole   trunk of clothes! Thank goodness, I thought I was gonna freeze to death. Ahh... much better! I feel warmer already. Hmm... looks like a space captain’s outfit. Well, it's not stealing if they just    leave it lying around in the hallway. And what's this? Wait... I know that device, I saw it in Ion. If I recall correctly, it’s some sort of intercom. It's outdated technology, but people used it to  record voice memos, almost like personal audio diaries... vintage tech that’s seeing a resurgence in popularity, like Polaroid cameras. And that's an audio card next to it. I wonder whom it belonged  to...)                                                                                              Grab the audio log device                                                                           Orion: (I can't help but be curious. And maybe it contains some useful information... Let's listen  to it.)                                                                                             Don't touch it                                                                                      Orion: (Bah. I doubt it contains any useful information... Let's continue. Isaac Langston, eh?      What's your story...? Maybe I can find more audio logs around here. Okay, I think this is the door  that leads to the canteen and the cinema. We walked through it when we went to the movies. What?    It's locked! Fuck! Is this because of the emergency shutdown from before? This bridge is my only way to get to Annie and the escape ships... Dammit, looks like the door only opens with a numpad. And  judging by these tools, someone has been trying to open the door... unsuccessfully, I guess. Is that another audio card?) *Picks it from the ground* (Yeah, it is. I wonder if it's from Isaac as       well... Who's leaving all these behind?)                                                            ???: THEY LOCKED US IN HERE!                                                                        Orion: F-Fuck! You scared me!                                                                       ???: They don't want us to leave! But why would we want to leave? We've been blessed!               Orion: (Why does this guy look so fucking nuts...) Um... Well, I'm happy to finally see someone. Do you know what happened? Everything was fine one hour ago! My date left the room and went to the     canteen, and a few minutes later... the lights went out and everyone had disappeared!               ???: The emergency system blocked the exits, everyone else is either hiding... or dead!             Orion: What?! Why?! What is going on? Are we being boarded by some kind of space pirates?           ???: The doctor said I could be one of the chosen ones! I have to be!                               Orion: *Sighs* (He not only looks nuts, he is completely nuts.) There's a trunk with clothes back   there, by the way. You must be freezing.                                                            ???: I'm good. Cold just makes you a better host... That’s why she lowered the temperature...       Orion: (The fuck is he talking about?) Okay... Uhh... I guess you don't know how I can get to the   canteen.                                                                                            Vasil: Oh, I do! Employees know the code for the door! I'm Vasil, I take care of the station's      cleaning, and help the doctor sometimes...                                                          Orion: Really?! That's great! Let's get out of here then!                                           Vasil: Oh... no, no! Not yet! Not until I have my egg!                                              Orion: W-What egg? What the fuck are you talking about?                                             Vasil: The egg! Doctor Mercer said I could be chosen! I need that egg! It's in the laboratory! Bring it to me and I'll open the door! I promise, yes...                                                 Orion: What laboratory... dude, you can go yourself. I don't have time for this shit! My date could be in danger, open the damn door!                                                                   Vasil: No, no, no... I need the egg... I can't leave without it... I need it, I need it! But it's   dangerous... Bring the egg and I'll open the door, I promise...                                     Orion: Come on... isn't there anything else you want? I... could pay you.                           Vasil: Money? Yes... I could buy another egg on Nox 7... I know a man... Give me 500 eternals and   I'll open the door, yes...                                                                          Orion: 500 eternals?!                                                                               Pay him 500 eternals                                                                                Orion: *Sighs* Okay, fine, take your fucking money.                                                 Vasil: Ah... yes! YES! I can buy one with this! I'll open the door, my friend... You can go save    your girl! G-Good luck!                                                                             Orion: Thank you!                                                                                   Vasil: Oh! And... take this bomb! Yes! The commander left it here... it might be u-useful.          Orion: A... b-bomb? Um... O-Okay, thanks buddy... Uh... Can I ask what you’re planning to do with   that money? What do you wanna buy, exactly?                                                         Vasil: It's a secret! I can't tell! No, no!                                                         Orion: You know what... I prefer not to know... Take care, Vasil. Okay, I'll... (Fuck, I don't have enough money! I guess I have no other choice then...)                                               Go find the egg                                                                                     Orion: *Sighs* I guess I have no other choice... Okay... where do I find that... egg?               Vasil: Excellent, excellent! Go to the lab and grab one of the eggs! But it has to be a closed one! Don't take one that has been opened already! They're big! You'll see them on top of a table at the  end of the room...                                                                                  Orion: The lab? Do you mean the botanical garden?                                                   Vasil: Yes, yes...                                                                                  Orion: (I think I saw it earlier. I was thinking of buying Annie one of those roses that glow in the dark before leaving.) Okay, I know where it is. I'll go get that "egg"... Wait for me here.        Vasil: I won't move from here...                                                                    Orion: (What the hell... these logs are starting to get creepy... Anyway... it's a bit of a hike    until the botanical garden. I'd better get going. It's a bit of a hike until the botanical garden.  I'd better get going. I hope Annie is alright... Okay, if I remember correctly now I had to turn    right and then...)                                                                                  ???: Turn around reeeeeal slow. No sudden moves. Else, I'll shoot you in the fucking head.          Understood?                                                                                         Orion: *Putting your hands up* E-Easy there, buddy. I'm not a threat. I'm just a passenger, a       customer of Astrocorp! W-Who are you?                                                               Commander Hasler: Commander Hasler, leader of the Second Brigade of the Galactic Union.             Orion: Okay man, looks like we're on the same side here, so... could you stop pointing that thing at me, please?                                                                                        Commander Hasler: . . . Okay, I believe you.                                                        Orion: Thank god... Why are you here? Do you know what happened?                                    Commander Hasler: I... was just visiting the theater today on a date with my girlfriend. She was    suddenly killed when one of those things jumped on her when we were exiting the theater.            Orion: Holy shit... I'm sorry to hear that.                                                         Commander Hasler: She’ll be fine. But I can't die here. If I lose my level, I'll also lose my job at the Brigade. I can't afford that. Plus, I have to avenge her.                                      Orion: But who is attacking us??                                                                    Commander Hasler: What is attacking us.                                                             Orion: "What"...?                                                                                   Commander Hasler: A few months ago, I started hearing rumors about some kind of... plague that was  spreading through Andromeda with great speed. I thought it was all bullshit, but... today I saw it  firsthand. We need to destroy this entire station to kill the infection.                            Orion: What the hell... Um... Okay, do your thing, I don't really care about what happens to this   station. I have to go to the botanical garden.                                                      Commander Hasler: The botanical lab?! WHY?                                                          Orion: *Putting your hands up* A m-man told me to grab something for him there! I'm looking for my  date, but there's a door blocking the way, and only he knows the code!                              Commander Hasler: Don't go to the lab!                                                              Orion: W-Why? And why is everyone calling it the “lab”?                                             Commander Hasler: That doesn't matter!                                                              Orion: But the door...                                                                              Commander Hasler: I can open that door myself. Do me a favor instead, and I'll open it for you.     Orion: What kind of favor?                                                                          Commander Hasler: This. Go to the generator room and place this explosive next to the main          generator.                                                                                          Orion: An explosive...?                                                                             Commander Hasler: It won't be activated until I trigger the remote control, don't worry.            Orion: Okay, so... If I leave this explosive in the generator room... you'll open the door that     leads to the canteen?                                                                               Commander Hasler: Yes. I'd go myself, but I need to place another explosive at the other side of the station.                                                                                           Orion: *Sighs* Okay... I'll do it.                                                                  Commander Hasler: Good. And take this gun. You might need it.                                       Orion: Really? You're giving it to me?                                                              Commander Hasler: Just take it and don't ask so many questions.                                     Take the gun                                                                                        Orion: *Taking the pistol* Thanks. Are you sure you're gonna be okay without your gun?              Don't take it                                                                                       Orion: Thanks, but I don't need it. You can keep it.                                                Commander Hasler: . . . Suit yourself.                                                              Orion: I'd feel bad taking your only gun.                                                           Commander Hasler: It's not mine. I found it lying around, along with some scraps of armor and some  engineering gadgets. I also found these old audio cards next to it.                                 Orion: Oh, I found some of those too.                                                               Commander Hasler: They were inside an almost empty backpack with a big hole at the bottom. I’m      guessing the owner must have been losing their stuff wherever they passed.                          Orion: Do you mind if I take these too? Do you mind if I take these instead?                        Commander Hasler: Nah, they're all yours.                                                           Orion: Alright then, I'll go to the generator room and... place the bomb. Alright then, I'll go to  the generator room and... place the bomb.                                                           Commander Hasler: Thank you for your cooperation. Meet me back at the door you mentioned. I'll open it and help you save your girl.                                                                     Orion: Done deal.                                                                                   Commander Hasler: Good luck.                                                                        Orion: (A dream...? It wouldn't be the first time someone dreamt about Eternum, but in 1979? 45     years before Eternum's launch? That's... unbelievable... Hmm... If I go left, I'll get to the lab.  If I go right, the generator room. That Vasil was totally crazy, I can't trust him. But... can I    trust Commander Hasler? I feel like he's hiding something from me...)                               Help Vasil and go get an egg                                                                        Orion: (I don't trust that Hasler guy. Vasil might be weird, but at least he seemed sincere. To the lab. I think I'm going the right way... This is it... The... "lab". Why does a dating and           experiential company even need a laboratory? Looks like someone has been here already... and whoever they were, they left one of those sound cards behind. Okay, I need to find a table with...)        Doctor Mercer: Y-You!                                                                               Orion: FUCK! W-What... Who are you? Why are you handcuffed to that pipe?                            Doctor Mercer: That fucking mercenary! He did this to me! He's trying to kill us all!               Orion: Do you mean... Commander Hasler?                                                             Doctor Mercer: Yes! He came in here and threatened me! He said he'd destroy the entire station!     Orion: Do you know why? Is it because of those eggs?                                                Doctor Mercer: What eggs? The ones on my table? I found those on Nox 7! I don't even know what they are! Please, you have to uncuff me! I beg you! The keys to the cuffs are on the desk over there!    Orion: The ones next to the tools?                                                                  Doctor Mercer: Yeah! Another man came here a few minutes ago, but he didn't want to help me! I think he's working with Hasler!                                                                          Orion: Hmm...                                                                                       Uncuff her                                                                                          Orion: Alright... Don't make me regret this.                                                        Doctor Mercer: Thank you, THANK YOU! You have a good soul, thank god! Who are you?                  Orion: I'm Orion, I just came here to go on a date, like everybody else, I guess. Do you know       anything about what's happening in this station?                                                    Doctor Mercer: Nothing! I was working on a new serum for my micro-algae when suddenly, the power    went out. Next thing I knew, everyone was missing!                                                  Orion: Do you know Vasil?                                                                           Doctor Mercer: Of course, he's my assistant! He's not... the smartest, but he has a good heart. I   had just sent him to the hangar to leave the station when that mercenary arrived and handcuffed me. Orion: I see... Well, you should leave the station ASAP. I don't know what's out there, but... it's not good. Find one of the teleporters and get out of here.                                          Doctor Mercer: You're not coming?                                                                   Orion: I have to find someone. My date is missing.                                                  Doctor Mercer: I see... I'll be on my way, then. Good luck, and thanks again!                       Don't uncuff her                                                                                    Orion: I'm... I'm sorry, I can't trust you.                                                         Doctor Mercer: WHAT?! You're gonna leave me here? To be devoured by those things?!                  Orion: I'll fix this! As soon as I get out of here, I'll send help, I promise!                      Doctor Mercer: You can't do this to me! You're even worse than that mercenary! I curse you!         Orion: I'm sorry. (Okay, and now... where are those damn eggs? Hmm... those things definitely look  like eggs... more or less. They're bigger than I thought, though. One of the unhatched ones... I    wonder why he wants one of these... And why the hell are they so big? They look like dinosaur       eggs.)                                                                                              Take a look inside the open eggs                                                                    Orion: (That's an odd way of opening. Hmmm... And they're not empty. They’re full of... Wait, is    that moving? Hgggg!!!) *Falling on your knees* (W-WHAT THE HELL IS... HGGG!! I CAN'T...!)           Grab a closed egg and leave                                                                         Orion: (I don't have time to waste. Annie needs me. Let's go back to Vasil.)                        Help Commander Hasler and place the bomb                                                            Orion: (I don't trust that Vasil guy. Hasler might be hiding something, but at least he's not crazy. He even gave me a gun, so he trusts me. To the generator. This station is bigger than I thought... The corridors seem to never end... Fuck, I'd like to think Annie left this place and she's safe, but I know she'd never leave without me, no matter how scared she was... I hope she's alright...)      *Drawing your weapon* WHO'S THERE?! *Panting* (I could swear I heard something...) I know you're    there! Show yourself!                                                                               . . .                                                                                               Orion: (Fuck, I need to finish this thing ASAP... I'll enjoy blowing this cursed place up. Let's    continue. Finally, the generator room. This seems to be the center of the room. I'll leave it       here.)                                                                                              AstroCorp employee: DON'T MOVE!                                                                     Orion: *Turning around* E-Easy there.                                                               AstroCorp employee: YOU'RE ONE OF THEM! YOU BROUGHT THIS UPON US!                                   Orion: One of them? I don't even know what you’re talking about!                                    AstroCorp employee: Those... things! Claire was feeling sick s-so I brought her to the infirmary,   and... W-when I was about to leave, that... m-monster exploded out of her chest! It killed her!     Orion: You need to calm down, Katniss.                                                              AstroCorp employee: How do you know my name?!                                                       Orion: We met when I first arrived at the station... just a few hours ago, remember? Orion and      Annie. You welcomed us and suggested that we visit the theater and the Zero-G room.                 AstroCorp employee: . . . I remember you.                                                           Orion: (Thank god...)                                                                               AstroCorp employee: What is going on here?                                                          Orion: I know as much as you. I'm just trying to find Annie and get out of here. *Placing the       explosive* You should go to the hangar and use one of those teleporters to go back to the Entrance  Hall.                                                                                               AstroCorp employee: Is... is that a bomb?                                                           Orion: Um... yeah, it's a long story. The door that leads to the canteen is locked, and a man asked me to...                                                                                            You grab the creature in the air.                                                                   Orion: What the hell is this...                                                                     AstroCorp employee: T-That's... that's what came out of Claire's chest!                             Orion: This thing caused all the chaos? It doesn't even have eyes... is it blind? They don't seem   like a big threat...                                                                                AstroCorp employee: They don't seem like a big threat?! I don't even know how the hell you saw it   coming! I'd be dead if I'd been in your place!                                                      Orion: What does it have inside of its mouth? Another card... I guess we're not the first ones this thing attacked... Maybe... I need to go back to the living areas, Katniss. You go to the hangar and take one of the remaining escape pods or teleporters.                                               AstroCorp employee: O-Okay! D-Don't get eaten!                                                      Orion: I'll try... AAAAAAARGH!!! WHAT THE FUCK!                                                     AstroCorp employee: That's what came out of Claire's chest!                                         Orion: GET IT OFF ME!                                                                               AstroCorp employee: W-What?!                                                                        Orion: GET IT OFF ME!!! (Jesus Christ, this fucking egg weighs a ton...) *Lifting the egg* Is this  what you wanted?                                                                                    Vasil: Ahh... yes, YES! The egg is finally with Vasil!                                              Orion: Will you open the door now?                                                                  Vasil: Of course, OF COURSE! Vasil keeps his promises... You can go save your girl! Good luck!      Orion: Thank you! Uh... Can I ask what you’re planning to do with that?                             Vasil: It's a secret! I can't tell! No, no!                                                         Orion: You know what... I prefer not to know... Take care, Vasil.                                   Vasil: *Giggles* The egg is all mine!                                                               Orion: (What...?) Hasler? What is going on here?                                                    Commander Hasler: I'll ask one last time. Where do they come from?                                  Vasil: *Crying* I d-don't know, I swear! They've always been here! The first reports date back 10   years! That's all we know!                                                                          Commander Hasler: So it's all Ulysses’ doing?                                                       Vasil: No! They've always been here! They're not programmed!                                        Commander Hasler: You're not making any sense. Where did Doctor Mercer find those eggs?             Vasil: *Crying* I d-don't know...                                                                   Commander Hasler: Then you're not useful to me anymore.                                             Orion: *Hyperventilating* W-What... D-Doctor Mercer?                                                Doctor Mercer: Are you okay, Vasil?                                                                 Vasil: *Crying* He hurt me...                                                                       Doctor Mercer: Shhh... It's alright now... Everything will be fine soon...                          Vasil: Can I... Can I have an egg now?                                                              Doctor Mercer: No... Not yet, Vasil... I have something much more special reserved for you... You   just have to wait a bit longer... We will help this stranger now, and then we will leave together,  alright?                                                                                            Vasil: Alright...                                                                                   Doctor Mercer: You can leave. Go save your girl. Thank you for your cooperation.                    Orion: You're fucking insane... Are you the one behind this whole nightmare?                        Doctor Mercer: God, no, I wish... But I've been studying these creatures for a long time. The plague of Andromeda... the ultimate stage of evolution... an improved, advanced version of the ones we've seen so far... the perfect predator. The old lab at this station was the perfect cover for my       studies.                                                                                            Orion: What are you trying to do?                                                                   Doctor Mercer: The simulation of Eternum is perfect, Orion. They say it’s more real than real life. If I can isolate the DNA of these specimens, I can try to create them on the other side too, don't  you understand?                                                                                     Orion: That's completely loony. You're crazy.                                                       Doctor Mercer: Gregor Mendel was also labeled as a madman, and today we call him the father of      genetics. We'll see what people call me in 50 years...                                              Orion: Whatever you say...                                                                          Doctor Mercer: Goodbye, Orion...                                                                    Orion: W-What the hell are you doing?! Why did you kill him?!                                       Commander Hasler: Don't worry, our... friend told me the code of the door. You can go, as promised. Orion: You're a fucking psycho! You didn't have to shoot him!                                       Commander Hasler: I did what I had to do. Now go find your girl and get out of this place before    everything blows.                                                                                   Orion: (This bastard used me... Why... How... Anyway... I can't worry about that now. She can do    whatever she likes... He can do whatever he likes... Fuck them all. I’ve gotta save Annie! Jesus,   what the hell happened here...? There's blood everywhere...) ANNIE?!                                . . .                                                                                               Orion: (Darn it...)                                                                                 Annie: *Rapid breathing*                                                                            Orion: (What...?) Hmm? Is that...? Annie?!                                                          Annie: *Whispering* They can't hurt you if you don't see them, they can't hurt you if you don't see them...                                                                                             Orion: Annie, is that you?! *You go down the stairs* Annie!                                         Annie: Hmm...? Orion? Is t-that really you?                                                         Orion: Of course!                                                                                   Annie: OH MY GOD! I thought I was gonna be eaten alive here! *Sobbing* I thought everyone had       already left except me!                                                                             Orion: I could have never left alone! Did you really think I'd leave without you?                   Annie: *Nods*                                                                                       Orion: Oh Annie... I wouldn’t ever do that to you! I care for you way too much... You see how silly you’re being, right?                                                                                Annie: *Nods*                                                                                       Orion: Are you ready to leave this place?                                                           Annie: *Nods*                                                                                       Orion: Let's go. Can't wait to leave this place and never come back... I think it's this way... Yes! Look, Annie! A teleporter! We can get out of here!                                                 Annie: Thank god!                                                                                   Orion: Now how do I turn this thing on... Maybe this button?                                        CHARGING THE DISRUPTORS. THE TELEPORTER WILL BE USABLE IN 300 SECONDS.                              Orion: Oh, come on, really?!                                                                        Annie: *Pulling your shirt* Orion... L-Look...                                                      Orion: *Turning around* Oh shit... What the hell happened to this guy...?                           Annie: W-What's that thing?                                                                         Orion: It's one of those audio diaries... I've been finding them all over the station... (Could this be Isaac? The engineer?)                                                                           Listen to his last audio log Forget about it                                                        Annie: W-W-What was t-that...?                                                                      Orion: Oh shit... D-Don't look at him, Annie. As soon as the teleporter is ready, we'll leave this  place forever. You have nothing to–                                                                 Xenomorph: *Sniffs out Annie*                                                                       Orion: *Whispering* O-Okay Annie... A-As soon as this thing is ready, we’ll jump into it... D-Don't make any noise...

Xenomorph: *Squeals*                                                                                Orion: S-STAY BACK, YOU FILTHY MUTTS!                                                               Annie: OH GOD, T-THERE ARE DOZENS OF THEM!                                                          Orion: I have a bomb! I have one explosive left! If you're really so clever, you know that if you   attack us, you're gonna blow us ALL up! STAY BACK! (Goddammit, I can't activate my magic... I'm way too exhausted... And I doubt I could do anything against so many of them...)                        Annie: *Sobbing* Orion?                                                                             Orion: D-Don't worry, Annie... (We're fucked...)                                                    Xenomorph: . . .                                                                                    AstroCorp employee: If you need any assistance, you can ask me or any of my colleagues. Thank you   again for choosing Astrocorp. I'm pleased to welcome you to the ultimate experience of love. Ah, I  know that sound! Someone just used the teleporter to return! Come with me, you can ask them about   their experience yourselves! Our best advertising is the satisfaction of our customers. Welcome     back, lovers! How was the... Um... what are you covered with...?                                    Annie: What...                                                                                      Orion: How...                                                                                       Annie: Why... are we alive?                                                                         Orion: The bomb did explode.                                                                        Annie: It killed the aliens... but not us?                                                          Orion: What's this glow? It’s coming from your pocket.                                              Annie: *Standing up* No way...                                                                      Orion: What's that?                                                                                 Annie: I-It's the Pendant of Destiny!                                                               Orion: The what?                                                                                    Annie: The Pendant of Destiny! You bought this earring on Ion, at Chop-Chop's! You gave it to me the first time we played Eternum together, remember?                                                   Orion: Holy shit, I remember! Chop-Chop told me that it’d bring good luck to the girl who wore it... I can't believe it was true!                                                                       Annie: It vanished...                                                                               Orion: I guess it was single-use only.                                                              Annie: It saved our lives...                                                                        Orion: (Wow, I’ve gotta thank Chop-Chop next time... seems like he's not just some charlatan. Not   always, at least.)                                                                                  AstroCorp employee: Uh... Can you explain to me what's going on, guys?                              Orion: You know, I'd love to, but I'm all worn out and I just want to log off. So... maybe another  day.                                                                                                AstroCorp employee: But...                                                                          Annie: Long story short, the facilities are awesome, great muffins, and amazing experience! At the  last minute, though, some aliens invaded the station and killed everyone. There's probably a loooot of cleaning to be done, and I'd expect your ratings from Google Reviews to drastically drop in the  next few hours, so... you probably want to look into that. Sorry!                                   Orion: Bye!                                                                                         AstroCorp employee: What?                                                                           Player: I'm sorry, did she say that some aliens killed everyone?                                    AstroCorp employee: Um...                                                                           Orion: *Removing your visor* Jesus! (That sure escalated quickly! It's true what they say, you never know what you might run into in a new Eternum session. Damn...)                                    .  .  .  .  .                                                                                       Orion: *Removing your visor* Wait a second... WHAT??! (What the fuck just happened?! I was walking  around that damn station... and suddenly I'm fucking dead?! I didn't even hear anything!) *Sighs*   (Fuck this shit. Well, at least I didn't suffer...) *Removing your visor* Goddammit! (What the hell was that creature?! I didn't even see it coming... That thing jumped on me, and then... I don't     remember anything else. Just a terrible pain, and then... darkness.) *Removing your visor*          Goddammit! (Jesus, that explosion blew out everything... I don't even remember anything after the   creatures jumped on us... Just... darkness. It's very late. This has gone on far too long... I      should go to sleep now, I’ve gotta be fresh for tomorrow night.) *Sighs* (This is not how I wanted  my date with Annie to end up... Everything was going so well... until everything went to shit, as   always. Another bad memory for Annie. God, she'll probably be traumatized for years. I wonder if    this is it for us... Anyway, tomorrow will be another day. Annie must still be connected to Eternum, and I can't really wake her up. I'll wait in the dining room... She probably...) Oh... h-hey!      Annie: Best. Date. Ever!                                                                            Orion: Um... *Chuckles* Was it?                                                                     Annie: It was better than I could have ever imagined! We went to the movies together, we floated up into the air, we saw the stars together... It was like a romantic film! After that, everything      turned into a horror movie, and just when everything seemed lost... you came to rescue me! Then you tried to sacrifice yourself in order to destroy the monsters! That was so romantic! And to round off everything, we were saved thanks to a magic pendant you bought me the first time we played Eternum! And then you sacrificed yourself in order to destroy the monsters! That was so romantic!           Orion: B-But... we died.                                                                            Annie: It doesn't matter! Now we can start climbing Eternum's ranks together! It's even better!     Orion: *Chuckles* Well, that's not the reaction I was expecting from you. I just hope it doesn't    catch up with us one day.                                                                           Annie: And... w-well, the things we did in that room... It was... w-well, you know... A-Amazing...  Thank you for an amazing day, Orion.                                                                Orion: I'm glad you enjoyed it, Annie. Even with the alien attack, and... well, the bloodbath... it was still one of the best days I've ever had.                                                       Annie: It really was! We’ve gotta repeat it sometime! I mean... not necessarily like... every       part... y'know... Just hanging out and... W-Well, you helping me discover new things, new           experiences... I m-mean, I'm not just talking about... that! Although... we could repeat THAT too!  But not like... I mean, we don’t have to... Not that I don't want to... *Clears throat* ANYWAY! God, it's super late and I haven't had any dinner yet! See you tomorrow!                                Orion: *Chuckles* Goodnight!                                                                        You hear Annie giggling as she goes down the stairs.                                                Orion: (Well, that's not the reaction I was expecting, but... phew, I'm glad! I'm sure looking      forward to helping her to discover more... "new experiences". Tonight was... something else, that's for sure. God, I'm so hungry... The moment is finally here. The most exclusive meeting in the world is being held tonight. Ulysses' senior officials, the holders of the other Gems of Doom, and...     since we were able to retrieve the Gem from my dead body at the station... me! Ulysses' senior      officials, the holders of the other Gems of Doom, and... me! All together in one place! E-Suit      correctly adjusted... Check! E-Visor properly calibrated... Check! Lovely confirmation text from my partner in crime... Check! WE'RE READY!)                                                            Penelope: Good luck, Orion!                                                                         Orion: Hey! Thanks, Penny! (Damn, Penelope in her underwear is always a sight to behold...)         Penelope: I wish we could all go with you. I'm starting to be useful – yesterday I managed to master a level 6 healing spell! I wish we could all go with you. I'm starting to be useful – yesterday I  managed to master a level 5 fire spell!                                                             Orion: Damn, really? Not bad! And starting to be useful? Please! Between your acting during the     heist and your performance at Warthogs, you’ve more than held your own.                             Penelope: Thanks! You’re a sweetheart. I've been practicing with Luna these past few days. I can't  stop playing! I only took a break today because I went to the mall to buy a costume for the party   next week.                                                                                          Orion: Sounds good! What are you dressing up as?                                                    Penelope: *Giggles* That's a secret!                                                                Orion: Aww... come on! Give me a hint!                                                              Penelope: Nope!                                                                                     Orion: I'm sure Nova already knows what it is...                                                    Penelope: Of course she does! She came with me to the mall! But I want you to see it for the first  time at the party. Well... if you still want to come, of course.                                    Orion: Absolutely! I'm looking forward to it. Now that you mention it, I should start thinking about my costume too... (Damn, Penelope doesn't even mind going in her underwear around me. There's no   way out of this friend zone...)                                                                     Dalia: Look who it is! The blabbermouth! Be careful what you tell him, Penny, he might just gossip  it away to everyone he sees!                                                                        Orion: Come on Dalia, I already said I was sorry... Wish me luck!                                   Dalia: If you come back without losing our Gem of Doom, I'll be surprised. Don't screw up.          Orion: *Gulps* I'll try.                                                                            Dalia: Heeeey! Good luck with the fat cats, Orion!                                                  Orion: Thanks Dalia!                                                                                Dalia: If you can come back without losing our Gem of Doom, I'll consider it a success!             Orion: You wanna bet?                                                                               Dalia: *Giggles* Fuck off! I'm not betting against you ever again, you know it...                   Orion: Aw, that's too bad... Maybe you’ll change your mind in the future?                           Dalia: Unlikely...                                                                                  Orion: *Chuckles* I'll try.                                                                         Dalia: . . .                                                                                        Penelope: Hmm?                                                                                      Dalia: Did you run out of clean tops, or what?                                                      Penelope: I was about to take a shower and put on my pajamas.                                       Dalia: Your pajamas? You're not going out tonight? It's a Saturday.                                 Penelope: Nah, we have a party next week, I don't wanna feel overwhelmed. And plus, I wanted to play Eternum anyway.                                                                                    Dalia: “We” have a party? Who’s “we”? You and Orion?                                                Penelope: Yeah, Nova, Orion, and I are going to a party on campus. I could have sworn I told you    about it...                                                                                         Dalia: Rightttt, well, I definitely remember you mentioning Nova going... Anyway... you should hop  in the shower before you catch a cold.                                                              Penelope: Is there any problem with me being in my bra and panties? You seem very concerned all of a sudden.                                                                                            Dalia: Nah, it's just that... well, it might be awkward for other people.                           Penelope: What other people? You? Mom? Annie? I'm sure Orion doesn't mind either. He's like...      family. Like a little brother, almost.                                                              Orion: (Ouch.)                                                                                      Dalia: Yeah... like a little brother... If I didn't know any better, I'd think that you were trying something.                                                                                          Penelope: With Orion? Pffft, please, my bar is WAY higher. You’ve seen my Instagram DMs: models,    actors, influencers... did you know that that Gigachad meme guy from a few years ago tried sliding  into my DMs? In fact, if I didn't know any better, I'd think that YOU were trying something.        Dalia: Pffft, with that pervert with the monkfish face? Dream on.                                   Orion: Um... I'm still here, you know?                                                              Nancy: Best of luck, honey!                                                                         Orion: Thanks, Nancy! I wish I could invite more than one person.                                   Nancy: I'm sure that the next time they host a fancy dinner party, we'll have more than 1 Gem of    Doom, so that won't be a problem.                                                                   Orion: Ah, you're not wrong there!                                                                  Annie: Huh?? Are we celebrating something? What are you all doing here?                             Orion: Nothing, really. I was about to log in now.                                                  Annie: Oh, already?! Good luck, Orion! Be sure to get plenty of information!                        Orion: (Annie has been distant, but I'm happy to see her smile. I guess that's all I need for now.  That's what best friends do, I guess. I'm happy to see Annie smiling. I was afraid of her being     traumatized after whatever happened in that station, but I'm glad she managed to escape in time.)   Dalia: Yeah, do something useful for once, dumbass! Get us the address of Thanatos in real life, for example! Yeah, you better return with the name and address of Thanatos in real life!               Annie: Or some information about Ulysses' mysterious disappearances!                                Penelope: Or a couple of big sacks full of eternals!                                                Nancy: Or 5 new Gems of Doom in your pocket! I wanna see my face painted on the walls of Ulysses'   headquarters after we become the new CEOs!                                                          Orion: *Laughs* I think your expectations are a little bit too high, but sure, we'll see what Alex  and I can do. Don't get too bored while I'm gone.                                                   Nancy: Oh, don't worry about that, we have work to do! Turns out Aunt Cordelia is celebrating her   65th birthday next week. Your uncle asked us to do a collage of photos of her. We’ve gotta go       through all of the family photo albums, and find the 100 best pictures of her, from birth ‘til now! Dalia: . . .                                                                                        Penelope: . . .                                                                                     Dalia: Awwww, fuck! You know what I just remembered, sis? The... uhh, uhhh... a-bra-panty-ism       Seminar!                                                                                            Penelope: AHHH, shit, the ABRAPANTISM SEMINAR! Was today the last day to register?                  Dalia: Yeaahhh... we have until midnight...                                                         Penelope: Oh, dammit... How could we forget?! I'm sorry Mom, we've gotta login to Eternum to check  into the Abrapantism server... We need it for... um... special Gem of Doom handling protocols...    Your character must not need it for some reason...                                                  Dalia: DARN IT! AGH! I’m so mad! I SO wish we could participate in the creation of that collage...  Penelope: Yeah, with how much we love Aunt Cordelia...                                              Dalia: Well, I guess we’ve gotta go if we want to get there in time...                              Penelope: Yeah, I guess so...                                                                       Dalia: *Running away* Sorry Mom!                                                                    Penelope: We'll make it up to you next week, we promise! *Whispering to Dalia* Seriously, you       couldn’t think of anything better than bra-and-panties??                                            Nancy: Hmmm....                                                                                     Annie: I can help you out if you want, ma'am. I don't know Aunt Cordelia, but I'm good at making    collages.                                                                                           Nancy: AAAAAAH! How can you be so adorable?! If you were just a little bit smaller, I'd eat you     whole! Thank you Annie!                                                                             Annie: N-No problem!                                                                                Nancy: Let's go to the living room! *Going downstairs* Have fun Orion!                              Orion: *Chuckles* Thanks! *Jumping on the bed* Alright, time to log in. Here we go!                 Connected. Welcome back to Eternum.                                                                 Orion: To the Rockefeller server, please! Idriel invited me herself this time, you know? I feel a   little special, hehe...                                                                             Please prepare to connect...                                                                        Orion: I couldn't be more prepared! (Another great landing! Alright... If I'm not wrong, we were    supposed to drop directly at the site, so...) *Whistles* (Damn, look at this mansion. An estate like this must cost tens of millions of eternals. This is definitely the place. Hey, this tuxedo fits me like a glove! And it looks more expensive than it actually is, so I should be able to get by       relatively unnoticed. Nice! I’ve gotta thank Penelope and her model connections for this sweet deal! I wonder what Alex will be wearing... Speaking of which, I should find her as soon as possible. We were supposed to meet at the backyard of the mansion, but this whole place is a maze. Maybe she's   already inside? Hmm, there's a woman right in front of the gates. I'll go ask her...) Good evening! Player: Welcome to the Boyle mansion, sir. How may I help you?                                      Orion: Uh... My name is Orion Richards. I...                                                        Player: Of course, sir. I see your name on our guest list. You may enter at your convenience.       Orion: Ah, excellent.                                                                               Player: In accordance with the night's theme, please consider wearing your mask before entering the mansion. A mask for yourself and for your partner should appear in your inventory.                  Orion: Understood.                                                                                  Player: If you would like, you may reveal your name to other attendees. However, it is prohibited to remove your mask during tonight’s event. Everyone inside the mansion must wear them... except for  the staff, of course.                                                                               Orion: The bossman doesn't let you play?                                                            Player: The invited guests are the only human players at the mansion. It would not make sense for us to engage in the event.                                                                            Orion: The... wait, you... you're not human?                                                        NPC: I'm not. Every single butler, waiter, and staff member in the mansion tonight is a non-playable character. ...Including me.                                                                        Orion: (Holy fuck... She looks so real and speaks so eloquently... I'd have never guessed.) Um...   alright, thank you.                                                                                 NPC: Enjoy your stay, sir.                                                                          Orion: (Okay... First things first, I have to find Alex. She told me she was planning to get here   earlier than me. She's a smart girl, she must have hidden near the back of the house to avoid       running into her father, since she didn’t have a mask on her. Now that I think about it, though...  William Bardot has seen my face too. I should probably get away from the entrance...) *Turning      around* (I wouldn't want to...) *Gulps*                                                             Praetorian: Good evening, sir.                                                                      Orion: W-What?                                                                                      Praetorian: Welcome to the Boyle mansion.                                                           Orion: (Oh... God, I forgot they all have the same face... She's not the one the girls and I met in Ogygia. I’ve gotta calm down.) G-Good to see Praetorians here. I feel safer already.                Praetorian: Of course, sir. We’re taking all necessary precautions to ensure the security and safety of the players attending tonight.                                                                  Orion: G-Good. Good. Are there many of you here?                                                    Praetorian: Enough units to prevent any unwelcome individuals, or to quell any possible conflicts.  Orion: *Nervous laughter* Well, I guess I'll cancel all my planned shenanigans for tonight, then.   Praetorian: . . .                                                                                   Orion: *Clears throat* K-Kidding aside though, I think I'm gonna go for a little walk through the   gardens. That’s allowed, right?                                                                     Praetorian: Of course. Just remember to wear your mask when entering the mansion.                   Orion: S-Sure. Thank you! I'll see you around. (Holy shit, those damn eyes... They pierce your soul. Talking with a Praetorian face to face is so uncomfortable. It feels like she can cut your throat  at any second. Okay, calm down, Orion. You’ve gotta keep it cool. You can't appear inside, drenched in sweat. On the other hand, I definitely have a future as a scared Annie impersonator... But       anyway... where the hell is Alex?! She said–)                                                       Alex: BOO!                                                                                          Orion: GGGGHHHHH YOU SON OF A BITCH!!!! *Panting* F-FUCK! What the hell is wrong with you?!!        She snorts, trying to hold her laugh.                                                               Orion: *Standing up* Yeah, very funny, Alex! And very mature!                                       Alex: *Chuckles* Come on Orion, it's your fault for being so jumpy!                                 Orion: I'm not jumpy! It's just that... loud noises... make me... jump. B-But in any case, I don't  wanna die of a heart attack before I’m 20! Why does everybody keep trying to scare me?!             Alex: *Chuckles* Because it's funny seeing you jump like a wallaby!                                 Orion: *Laughs* Fuck off. I'll remember this one! Don't cry later, when I have my revenge...        Alex: You’re gonna scare me? Hah! Good luck. It's impossible.                                       Orion: Oh, we'll see about that... We'll see...                                                     Alex: Anyway... pretty fancy place, huh? Reminds me of our house in Wales. We used to go there      during the holidays when I was 7 or 8 years old. I used to spend entire days on the lake with my    grandma.                                                                                            Orion: Oh really? And you don't go there anymore?                                                   Alex: Nah, after she... died of cancer, I stopped going anywhere with my family. They've always had better things to do.                                                                                Orion: Oh... I'm sorry, Alex.                                                                       Alex: No worries, it's been a long time. But thank you.                                             Orion: Damn... You know, now that I can look at you properly...                                     You look incredibly beautiful tonight                                                               Orion: You look incredibly beautiful tonight, Alex. That dress is...                                Alex: Yeah, yeah, that dress looks AMAZING on you and blah blah blah. Can we focus on the mission,  please?                                                                                             Orion: Oh... of c-course! Sorry, I forgot that you don't like compliments.                          Alex: I don't like to be buttered up. It's different. But anyway, getting back to business... do you have the masks?                                                                                    You look like a high-society gal!                                                                   Orion: You look like a high-society gal!                                                            Alex: Oh, you really think so?                                                                      Orion: Yep, definitely!                                                                             Alex: *Batting her eyelashes* Isn't it amazing what some make-up and fancy clothes can do? Suddenly, the rebellious child is the perfect young lady! *Batting her eyelashes* The ugly duckling has      turned into a beautiful swan! The black sheep has changed her colors! Finally, Papa will accept me  back into the family!                                                                               Orion: *Laughs* Well, even if it's absurd to deny that you really look stunning with that dress...  I've gotta say that I prefer the real you. An Alex with no tattoos is no Alex. They're like... part of you.                                                                                             Alex: You're goddamn right.                                                                         Orion: You did a great job hiding them, though. I can't see any trace.                              Alex: It's not the first time I've had to use makeup to hide them. I attended a couple of dinners   like this in the real world with my father shortly after I got the first ones. But after a few...   incidents... he stopped forcing me to go. Less embarrassment for him, I guess.                      Orion: Are you wearing makeup on your arms too? Under the gloves?                                   Alex: Yeah, I am. You never know what could happen. So I put makeup on everywhere.                  Orion: Everywhere? You sure you didn’t have any trouble with an area? If you want, I can check if   the tattoos on your back and thighs are covered up well, under the dress. I wouldn't mind, really.  It’s for the good of the mission. You never know what could happen...                               Alex: *Chuckles* I bet you wouldn't dare... I'm sure everything is perfectly hidden, but thanks for the offer. I'll definitely keep it in mind...                                                       Orion: (Hmm... is she... flirting with me? Or is she just messing with me? It's hard to tell with   her... Probably the second, let's be realistic.)                                                    Alex: Anyway, getting back to business... do you have the masks?                                    Orion: I do! *Standing up* Yeah, very funny, Alexandra! And very mature!                            Alex: Oh, come on, Orion, it's your fault for being so jumpy.                                       Orion: Yeah, sure...                                                                                Alex: Alright, stop being a pussy! We have a mission to do here... don't we?                        Orion: Yeah, we should go inside before someone notices us hiding back here.                        Alex: Do you have the masks?                                                                        Orion: They're right here.                                                                          Alex: Huh, interesting. Everyone has the same ones?                                                 Orion: I saw a couple of people in the distance and they were pretty similar. But different colors. Alex: So... we have a cat and... a demon?                                                           Orion: Yeah, it seems so. Which one do you want?                                                    Alex: Uhh... well, I guess I'll go with the cat. I'll leave the oni one to you. It's... more your   color.                                                                                              Orion: *Chuckles* I'll take that as a compliment. Alright then, we're all set. Any advice?          Alex: These people love talking about themselves. Try to keep the conversation on them. Then you can try to casually sneak in a question about what we want to know. But don't make it look like an     interrogation.                                                                                      Orion: Gotcha.                                                                                      Alex: What topics should we prioritize tonight, anyway?                                             Orion: Well, anything we can learn about the Gems of Doom, the Weapons of Atlas, or Thanatos would  be useful. Maybe someone knows something about the deaths that Ulysses has hidden, but that might be difficult to bring up.                                                                             Alex: I see. Sounds good to me.                                                                     Orion: Alright then, put on your mask and let's get back to the party! The main entrance is this    way, past the corner.                                                                               Calypso: And where shall we meet to share reconnaissance after the dinner? I prefer gathering       intelligence myself, but if either of you gains information on Hyril'ar, I would like to hear it.   Orion: Great point! I think a good meeting spot would be at... . . . *Abruptly turning around*      W-WH...! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE?!                                                         Calypso: What do you mean? Am I supposed to stay locked up? I am not a bird, Orion.                 Orion: You can be wherever you want... EXCEPT HERE! Don't you remember what we talked about?! The   people who are looking for you are gonna be here! The guards who attacked us in Ogygia are here!    Shit, the people who crea... the people who put you in that box are probably IN this mansion!       Calypso: All the more reason to be here, then. I would very much enjoy having a conversation with   them.                                                                                               Orion: Oh god, this is such a bad idea...                                                           Calypso: Do not worry about me so much. I know how to take care of myself. My power used to be      feared across all the Elven Kingdoms.                                                               Orion: That doesn't exactly give me peace of mind... And how did you get in here, even? A-And what's up with that dress? I'm pretty sure it's not elven.                                                Calypso: Oh, well, I simply opened a portal to your location. I can instantly appear wherever you   are. And this attire... I copied parts of the outfits of other women I saw entering this palace. I  usually do not like your peasant garb, but this time I was not entirely displeased by them. I       believe these people are the elite of your society, correct?                                        Orion: Um... yeah, I guess you could say that. Well, I can't say this dress was a bad choice... You look...                                                                                             Alex: You look hot as fuck, Calypso!                                                                Calypso: That is... quite inappropriate, but I will allow it. Thank you, Alexandra. You look... “hot as fuck” as well. I still suspect that the blood of my race courses through your veins.            Alex: And I still doubt it, but hey... maybe a distant relative, who knows.                         Calypso: Perhaps... Our blood is powerful. It could persist through many generations.               Alex: Alright, so... tell me, why did you come? What's your plan?                                   Calypso: I will keep a low profile, do not worry about me. While you try to seek information about  those Gems of Power, I will likewise ask questions about my realm.                                  Alex: I see... fair enough. Good luck with that.                                                    Calypso: If you need my assistance, Orion can summon me. I grant him permission to do that once     tonight.                                                                                            Alex: Well, he still doesn’t have full control of his powers, so we can't guarantee that, even if he tried.                                                                                             Orion: Hey, I'm getting better!                                                                     Alex: What about your face, though? It’s very distinct. I guess you could say you're just           roleplaying as an elf, and you wouldn't be the first, but someone might still recognize you. Someone you don't want to.                                                                                 Calypso: That's not a problem. I saw those masks too. I'll just create one for myself. Like this.   Alex: Wow... That's quite cool! And finally, what about the hair? Its turquoise color is quite...   unique.                                                                                             Calypso: This will do.                                                                              Orion: Damn! Can you really change your hair and clothes just by thinking about it?                 Calypso: Yes... something like that.                                                                Orion: Wow, you're like... living Penelope's dream.                                                 Calypso: Very well then, I will be on my way. If we do not see each other inside, we shall meet     again here after the event.                                                                         Orion: Alright, good luck, Calypso. And be careful!                                                 Calypso: I always am.                                                                               Orion: Well... what could go wrong?                                                                 Alex: I'm honestly more worried about the other guests than Calypso herself. Every day she seems... more powerful.                                                                                      Orion: Yeah, she's definitely recovering confidence and power. I guess we should go inside before   she starts disintegrating people.                                                                   Alex: Yeah, I guess so. Are you ready?                                                              Orion: Ready as I’ll ever be. Let’s go.                                                             Alex: *Using a posh accent* Remember to talk as if you're better than the rest of the world.        Orion: Impersonating Axel, then? Got it.                                                            Alex: *Chuckles* I see you catch on fast.                                                           Orion: Damn... Holy fuck, this place is so... staggering.                                           Alex: And ostentatious. It's always a question of excess – how much bigger and better am I than you? You’ve gotta flaunt it.                                                                            Orion: I feel so out of place, like they can see and smell the “poor” on me. Do I look rich to you? Alex: You look passable. Don't worry too much, none of them are particularly clever, I know that    from experience.                                                                                    NPC: Good evening, sir, and welcome to the Boyle mansion.                                           Orion: Thank you.                                                                                   NPC: The Founder and the Lady of Eternum will make an appearance at 11:00 PM, but all other guests  have already arrived.                                                                               Orion: Ah, the big man.                                                                             NPC: He apologizes for his delay, as an unforeseen event has detained him.                          Orion: Well, that's sensible. I imagine that being the CEO of the biggest company on Earth has to   keep you busy.                                                                                      NPC: In the meantime, I suggest you partake in our gourmet cuisine, featuring a wine selection      carefully crafted by our in-house sommeliers.                                                       Orion: That sounds good! Wait, is that sushi?                                                       NPC: Yes it is, sir. Would you like to taste it?                                                    Orion: Sure!                                                                                        NPC: You can find further savory foods and other culinary delights in the Golden Room.              Orion: I'll check it out! Thank you.                                                                Alex: We didn’t come here to eat, remember?                                                         Orion: Oh, come on, Alex! I can't even eat a couple of canapes? Oh, come on, Alexandra! I can't even eat a couple of canapes?                                                                           Alex: Eat this one if you want, but that's it. You need to be focused.                              Orion: Of course I'll be focused! It's just sushi, not a joint. *Eating the sushi* Mmph... *Eating  the sushi* It's mnot as if it's mgonna– J-JESUS TAPDANCING CHRIST! T-This is... DIVINE!             Alex: The sushi?                                                                                    Orion: Is this what rich people eat everyday?! Sweet Mother of God, it's the best thing I've ever   tasted!                                                                                             Alex: You're outrageous, you know? You’ve never eaten sushi before?                                 Orion: This is not normal sushi! It's like... having an orgasm in your mouth!                       Alex: Oh, for fuck's sake, don't overreact. It's just a handful of rice with a slice of tuna on top of it.                                                                                              Orion: TASTE IT!                                                                                    Alex: *Sighs* Fine, I'll eat one. Will you shut up and start focusing if I do?                      Orion: YES!                                                                                         Alex: *Eating the sushi* Mmph... *Eating the sushi* Mmhappy? Can w–                                 Orion: AND?!                                                                                        Alex: (Sweet Mother of God, this shit is divine. It's the best thing I've ever tasted. It’s like the nectar of the gods.)                                                                               Orion: It's amazing, isn't it?                                                                      Alex: *Clears throat* Um... y-yeah, it's not... n-not bad.                                          Orion: NOT BAD?!                                                                                    Alex: O-Okay, enough! Excuse me?? You can't tell me what to do! Shut up and start focusing, for     fuck's sake. We didn't come here to drink and eat, Orion!                                           Orion: Yeah, you're right, I'm sorry. Y-Yeah, you're right... I'm sorry.                            Alex: No more distractions! Dalia, Nova, and all the others are counting on us! So we need to stay  focused, no matter how ridiculously good the food is here.                                          Orion: So you admit that that sushi was amazing!                                                    Alex: . . . Jesus Christ, it was glorious! How can it be so fucking good?! Do you think we can sneak a platter out of Eternum?                                                                          Orion: Right??!                                                                                     Alex: It was like... having an orgasm in your mouth!                                                Orion: I know!!!                                                                                    Alex: B-But that's enough! Let's focus on the mission! Dalia, Nova, and all the others are counting on us! So we need to stay focused!                                                                  Orion: You’re right... we should get going.                                                         Alex: We should split up. We'll be able to talk to more people that way.                            Orion: Makes sense.                                                                                 Alex: I can see 3 members of Ulysses' board of directors from here, on the upper floor. I'll leave  them to you. I doubt they would recognize me, but I prefer not to take that risk. The bearded man is Dr. Du Pont. He's as disgusting as my father, so be careful with him. The woman is Lisa Astor.     She's haughty and full of herself, so you'll probably get her attention easily by complimenting her. And the last one is Mr. Mos. He's... nice. Or at least he's pretending to be. He was the only one  of them who didn’t goggle at me the last time I saw these pigs. I'll give him the benefit of the    doubt.                                                                                              Orion: Understood. You take the other stairs. Let's meet again downstairs, next to the statues.     Alex: Okay. Good luck.                                                                              Orion: Good luck! (Alright, you got this, Orion.) *Forcing a posh accent* It's refreshing to find   someone whose countenance complements her attire so excellently, Madame. (Yeah, I'm nailing it.)    Hmm...                                                                                              Dr. Du Pont: How many times do I have to say it?! I. WANT. MORE. WINE! Get your ass to the cellar   and bring me a full bottle, you moron! Aghh... These fucking idiots still need a ton of             improvement.                                                                                        Orion: I agree. Whoever programmed them has no idea what they're doing. Can you believe I asked for salmon nigiri, and they brought me uramaki?                                                         Dr. Du Pont: Exactly. These programmers are terrible. I bet they hired immigrants. Or worse...      women.                                                                                              Orion: Yeah, I bet they did. (Jesus, what a fucking bigot.) Can I ask you something, Dr. Du Pont?   Dr. Du Pont: No. I don't even know who you are.                                                     Orion: Uh... I'm... in charge of Ulysses' network security.                                         Dr. Du Pont: Then let me tell you that you're doing a shit job.                                     Orion: (This guy's a tough nut to crack...)                                                         Dr. Du Pont: We had a security breach in a restricted server the other day. Was that your fault?    Orion: Oh... yeah, I've heard of it. I'm so sorry, we were attacked by a group of... Chinese        hackers.                                                                                            Dr. Du Pont: Chinese, huh? That makes sense.                                                        Orion: Everything is resolved now.                                                                  Dr. Du Pont: What do you mean, everything? They stole something very valuable.                      Orion: Oh, really? What was it?                                                                     Dr. Du Pont: You don't know? One of those Weapons of Atlas or something. I don't care about that    bullshit, but if it becomes public that we can be robbed so easily, our stock will take a hit.      Orion: I see... If I may ask, if that weapon was so valuable... why wasn't there more security? More Praetorians guarding it?                                                                           Dr. Du Pont: I don't know, you tell me. Aren't you in charge of Ulysses' network security?? Why     isn't there a fucking Praetorian in every corner of Eternum?                                        Orion: Uh... well...                                                                                Dr. Du Pont: . . . ...What was your name again?                                                     Orion: Uh...                                                                                        NPC: Good evening, gentlemen. Would you care for an hors d'oeuvre?                                  Orion: (Oof, thank god. He was backing me into a corner here. He doesn't seem that invested in      Eternum’s day-to-day goings-on though, unless it relates to the stock price. I won't get much more  info out of him.)                                                                                   Dr. Du Pont: I'll make it very clear to you: if you don't bring me my fucking wine in less than than 5 minutes, you will regret it. Do you understand?                                                  NPC: Of course, sir. My apologies. I will be right back.                                            Dr. Du Pont: Incompetent... Anyway, what were we talking about?                                     Orion: Um... I was saying that I'm headed to the kitchen to ask for an explanation.                 Dr. Du Pont: Good. Tell them to bring me my wine.                                                   Orion: Of course. Good evening, Dr. Du Pont.                                                        Dr. Du Pont: *Grunts*                                                                               Mr. Mos: *Whispering*                                                                               Orion: Good evening!                                                                                Mr. Mos's wife: *Giggles*                                                                           Mr. Mos: Ah, good evening, young man. How can I help you?                                           Orion: You're Mr. Mos, right?                                                                       Mr. Mos: Hah, I guess these masks don't cover enough. Yes, I am. And this is my darling, Alice.     Mr. Mos's wife: Nice to meet you. I'll let you talk. I need a glass of champagne. Do you need       anything?                                                                                           Mr. Mos: No thank you, dear. Well... You must be the man who stole the Gem from Garrington.         Orion: W-Wha... How do you...                                                                       Mr. Mos: We have some business together, so I knew he was going to come here tonight. But it seems  he lost the Gem at the last moment. And then I noticed your tuxedo is not tailor-made, so I assumed you were one of the players invited tonight as part of the Gems event.                              Orion: Wow, you're as sharp as they say. Yeah, I had to buy this suit at the very last second, and I didn't have enough money to get a bespoke one.                                                     Mr. Mos: That is unfortunate. Take this as a small token of welcome. No self-respecting man should  go around without a good suit.                                                                      Orion: Did... did you just send me 120 eternals?! Wow, thank you!                                   Mr. Mos: This should be enough to have your suit tailored. True beauty comes from helping others.   Orion: (Damn, I guess there are some good people working at Ulysses.)                               Mr. Mos: Is there anything else I can help you with?                                                Orion: Well, now that you mention it... I've been wondering for a long time if... Do you know       anything about...                                                                                   The Founder                                                                                         Orion: The Founder?                                                                                 Mr. Mos: Hmm. He's a brilliant man. And most people don't realize how outrageously generous he is.  He could be charging monthly subscription fees, and every single player would happily pay it. Yet,  he chose not to.                                                                                    Orion: That is true.                                                                                Mr. Mos: But, personality-wise... I’m afraid there's not much I can tell you. He's a private man.   Orion: I see...                                                                                     The Syndicate                                                                                       Orion: The Syndicate?                                                                               Mr. Mos: . . . Where did you hear that name?                                                        Orion: Um... some people were talking about it in... a pub.                                         Mr. Mos: . . . It’s a group of people. They've been... causing some trouble. You know, just small   altercations and some public protests. Nothing to worry about.                                      Orion: (Hmm...) I see...                                                                            The Weapons of Atlas                                                                                Orion: The Weapons of Atlas?                                                                        Mr. Mos: Ah, yes... Hyas, Dione, and Calypso. Powerful artifacts. And the last one is yet to be     found.                                                                                              Orion: Yeah... (Du Pont knew that Calypso had been stolen. Mos has to know it too. Hmm, doesn't he  know someone stole it? Maybe he just wants to see my reaction...?) I hope it's me who finds...      Calypso, right? I've got some clues about its location!                                             Mr. Mos: . . . Best of luck, kid.                                                                   Orion: Thanks! Well, I don't want to inconvenience you any more. Thank you again for your gift, Mr. Mos.                                                                                                Mr. Mos: My pleasure...                                                                             Orion: (I'm not sure why, but he has an air of mystery around him... Huh, looks like Calypso managed to blend in rather well. What could they be talking about?)                                        Ms. Astor: Actually, he was caught with HER sister in HIS office!                                   Player: No way! How do you always have the juiciest rumors in all of Eternum?                       Ms. Astor: *Giggles* It's all about the connections, Susie. Is there any particular rumor you'd like me to confirm or deny? I know them all...                                                          Player: I heard the Founder was seen in Aphrodite's the other day. Is that true?!                   Ms. Astor: *Giggles* Well, I didn't tell you this, but...                                           Orion: (Damn. I'm digging the type of clothes these rich people are wearing. I wish Calypso or Alex would have chosen these threads...)                                                                 Ms. Astor: Cutie?                                                                                   Orion: U-Uh...? What?                                                                               Ms. Astor: Any rumors you've heard about lately?                                                    Orion: Oh... um... I've heard... that... Thanatos is actually a woman! That she walks on stilts and uses a voice changer to look like a big scary man.                                                  Ms. Astor: *Giggles* Oh, please, that's completely false. Actually... Keep this between us, but I go with him to the thermal baths of Hualalache.                                                       Player: Really?!                                                                                    Orion: Huala what?                                                                                  Ms. Astor: I've seen him naked and... let me tell you, his stature is absolutely dwarfed by the     weapon in his pants...                                                                              Player: Oh boy!                                                                                     Orion: (The thermal baths? That's total bullshit. Next she’ll be trying to convince me that Thanatos is actually just 3 kids in a trenchcoat.)                                                          Ms. Astor: And speaking of big instruments... I've got a new boyfriend, did I tell you?             Player: Oh, tell me, tell me! Who is he?                                                            Ms. Astor: I've been sleeping with a 24 year old bo–                                                Calypso: *Gasps*                                                                                    Orion: (Eh?)                                                                                        Calypso: You unnatural deviant...                                                                   Ms. Astor: Um... excuse me?                                                                         Calypso: How could you do that to an innocent child?                                                Ms. Astor: W-What? Did you hear me wrong? I said 24 years o–                                        Calypso: I could hear you loud and clear the very first time! How dare you boast about such an act! Ms. Astor: Um... What? I'm sorry, who are you again?                                                Calypso: Me? I am Prin–                                                                             Orion: S-She's a bit dizzy. Too much champagne! If you’ll excuse us, I'll escort her to the         restroom.                                                                                           Ms. Astor: Oh, I see. Of course.                                                                    Orion: *Whispering* What the hell was that?! You promised me you'd try to go unnoticed!             Calypso: Am I supposed to stand idly by when people in this place abuse children, with nary a       concern?                                                                                            Orion: What the hell are you talking about?!                                                        Calypso: That woman said she's sleeping with a 24 year old! An infant!                              Orion: Um... I'm still not sure how aging works with your race, but that's not an infant. Like, at  all. You know I'm only 18, right?                                                                   Calypso: *Gasps* You are... 18 years old?! I could barely walk when I was your age! You certainly... do not look 18.                                                                                    Orion: Alex, Dalia, Luna, and Annie are 18 too.                                                     Calypso: Sweet Mother of Celan'il, I have been spending time with toddlers!                         Orion: We're not kids! We just grow faster than you! If you were human, you wouldn't look like this at 84 years old, I can assure you. You definitely wouldn’t have this... figure. What's the life     expectancy of the elves, actually?                                                                  Calypso: Well... we grow up at a steady pace until we are 60 years old. After 60 years, an elf is   considered an adult. Our bodies then stay physically the same for the next 2000-3000 years.         Orion: Really? That's incredible! I wish we could live that long while looking eternally young. And what happens after all those years?                                                                 Calypso: We die, naturally. Although... it depends on the person. Lathlaeril, Lord of E'renabor, is still alive, and he is over 8000 years old. It is said he fought in the War of the Last Alliance.   Orion: Amazing. And another question... I was wondering, what happens if a 60 year old elf sleeps   with a 50 year old one?                                                                             Calypso: What do you mean...?                                                                       Orion: Well, you know, if an "adult" elf has sex with an "infant" one... is that some kind of taboo or...?                                                                                              Calypso: Ah. I... should not be the one explaining this to a commoner, but... yes, that is...       controversial.                                                                                      Orion: I see. Similar to our world, then.                                                           Calypso: Although, it is nothing compared to inter-caste relationships, of course. That is expressly prohibited.                                                                                        Orion: You mean like... a Prince with a peasant girl?                                               Calypso: Yes. It is despicable and prohibited altogether.                                           Orion: Come on... prohibited, yes, but despicable? The first time we met, you said you thought that relationships between humans and elves were hot because they were forbidden too...                  Calypso: I... n-never said such a thing.                                                            Orion: Oh! The Princess is lying to her people...                                                   Calypso: I... Agh, you are hopeless! *Clears throat* Whatever, I will go back to the gathering.     Orion: Don't get your hopes up, though. I think that woman is making things up as she speaks.       Calypso: Yes, I noticed. These people pretend to be high society, but they are nothing but facades. But I guess I will stay for now. I will be around if you need me.                                   Orion: I'll call you if we need your help! Thanks Caly.                                             Calypso: . . . You are welcome.                                                                     Orion: (I called the Princess by a diminutive and I wasn't threatened with vaporization. Making     progress. Bah, I won't get anything out of these people. Let's go downstairs. I pulled everything I could out of these people. Let's go downstairs. Hmm, Alex is already here. She's talking to         someone...)                                                                                         Alex: Ah, finally! Come here, quickly! Mr. Linus has something amazing to share with you!           Orion: Really? Well, I'm all ears.                                                                  Linus: It's nice to meet you. I'm Alastor Linus, ZipVerse's Chief Technology Officer.               Orion: Pleased to meet you.                                                                         Linus: My colleagues and I are interested in talking to you about our latest creation. We’ve finally put the finishing touches on our prototype of an artifact that will change Eternum forever. At     ZipVerse, our goal is to design products that allow users to answer daunting questions and explore  the curiosities of the human mind. For this project, we reached out to Eternum players to figure out the number one question on everyone’s mind... DOES IDRIEL HAVE A PUSSY?!                           Orion: Uh... excuse me?                                                                             Linus: Eternum's NPCs are directly designed and controlled by The Founder's team. Whether you like  it or not, Ulysses has the most advanced AI technology in the world. Their NPCs are bound to do what they are programmed to do, no matter the situation. And there was nothing we could do about it...  UNTIL NOW!                                                                                          Orion: Explain yourself...                                                                          Linus: Each NPC has a chip on their neck, similar to our neural implants, that dictates their       behavior. It determines their role in the game, interactions, and... limitations.                   Orion: And this artifact of yours...                                                                Linus: It is capable of reconfiguring the settings of said chip.                                    Orion: How?                                                                                         Linus: Let me offer you a practical demonstration... Hey there! Can you help us, cutie?             NPC: Of course, sir. Is there anything I can do to serve you?                                       Linus: Actually... yes! I'd like to go with you to the restroom real fast to have some fun.         NPC: . . . I'm sorry, I didn't understand your request.                                             Linus: Let me rephrase it: I want you to come with me to the restroom so I can fuck your little pink cunt until it’s sore.                                                                              NPC: ...I'm sorry sir, we can't do that.                                                            Linus: Just a quickie.                                                                              NPC: Please, do not insist or the Praetorians will intervene.                                       Linus: Aw... that's too bad. Can you give me your ID number, at least?                              NPC: Of course. It's 012-574-111.                                                                   Linus: Thank you.                                                                                   Orion: NPCs have ID numbers too? Like us?                                                           Linus: Yes, they all have one. It's linked to the chip I mentioned earlier. *Talking to the         artifact* 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 1, 1. You enter the number, you rotate this thing as if it was a     Rubik's Cube, and...                                                                                NPC: If you don't need anything else, I'll... ...I'll be on my way.                                 Linus: Not so fast... First, I want you to come with me to the restroom so I can fuck you.          NPC: Of course, sir.                                                                                Orion: Holy shit!                                                                                   Alex: What the hell...                                                                              Linus: Go ahead. I'll be there in a minute...                                                       Orion: How the fuck...                                                                              Linus: It's a REVOLUTION! And if you were wondering... yes, they have pussies. And they’re all      unique, too! It's simply... BRILLIANT!                                                              Orion: Are you not afraid of Ulysses taking action if they discover this?                           Linus: Ulysses and my company are trading partners. It wouldn't be the first time I've tried to push the limits while having fun. And besides, we're using technology that could be found inside the    world of Eternum, so... we're in a sort of legal gray area.                                         Orion: And could this... artifact be used with Idriel herself?                                      Linus: I tried asking for her ID number, but she's not programmed to tell it to us like the rest of them. She seems to be more advanced. But if somehow you managed to discover it... yes, it would be  possible. You could FUCK the Lady of Eternum!                                                       Orion: Well... that gives off a rapey vibe, to be honest... but technically it would also be        possible to make her or other NPCs help you, or give you confidential info, right?                  Linus: Uh... well, I didn't think of non-sexual applications of the artifact, but... yes, I guess it would be possible, of course.                                                                      Orion: Interesting...                                                                               Linus: So what? Are you interested? One prototype for only 25!                                      Orion: 25 eternals?! Absolutely! Give me 3!                                                         Linus: . . . ...25 million.                                                                         Orion: Oh...                                                                                        Alex: I'm feeling a bit sick. I'll go get some fresh air, meet me in the garden.                    Orion: ...Sure. (What got into her all of a sudden? Oh, fuck...)                                    Linus: William...                                                                                   William Bardot: Are you trying to rip people off with your junk again, Alastor?                     Linus: M-My business is always legitimate.                                                          William Bardot: I still don't understand why this company allows scum like you to come to these     events. This is why it is in decay.                                                                 Linus: I... I-I was leaving already. Um... I'll be in the Golden Room if you need me.               Orion: Sure.                                                                                        William walks in front of you while you try to avoid eye contact.                                   William Bardot: I hope that clown didn't disturb you.                                               Orion: N-No, it's all good, thank you.                                                              William Bardot: . . . Do we know each other?                                                        Orion: No, I'm pretty sure we’ve never met before...                                                William Bardot: . . .                                                                               Axel: Dad. Y-You have to come. Now.                                                                 Orion: (Oh shit, he's here too?!)                                                                   William Bardot: Not now, Axel.                                                                      Axel: Dad, it's important! I... saw something! P-Please!                                            William Bardot: . . . I'm sorry, I must excuse myself.                                              Orion: Mm-hm.                                                                                       William Bardot: . . .                                                                               Orion: (Oh my fucking god, why is he so terrifying?! Phew, that was close... I thought he recognized me for a second. I should go to the gardens with Alex... I've been here for too long.)             ???: Psyche.                                                                                        Orion: Hmm? I'm sorry? Are you talking to me?                                                       ???: Isn't this sculpture fascinating?                                                              Orion: The... statue?                                                                               ???: Yes.                                                                                           Orion: Yeah, it's rather impressive.                                                                ???: It represents Psyche, the goddess of the soul.                                                 Orion: Mm-hm. Cool. And who's this one?                                                             ???: A man.                                                                                         Orion: Well, yeah, I meant what man.                                                                ???: Just a man.                                                                                    Orion: So... no one in particular? Kind of an odd choice for a statue, isn't it?                    ???: It depends on whom you ask. Some people could see a god in the figure of a mere man. Can a man obtain the power of a god? Can a mortal subdue a deity? Can a human transcend the limitations of    mortality?                                                                                          Orion: Uh...                                                                                        ???: I used to think that I understood the basic rules of our world, until I saw Eternum. Here...   everything is different, and at the same time... exactly the same.                                  Orion: That's actually a good description. It has certainly transcended the term "video game".      ???: *Snorts* A video game. Have you ever met the creator of a server?                              Orion: The creator of a server...? Well, not personally, no.                                        ???: They say most of them are created by the Founder and his "team". As if they were the only ones who could sculpt Eternum.                                                                           Orion: I've met some hackers, though. *Chuckles* That's... almost a developer, right?               ???: What did they hack?                                                                            Orion: What? (Shit, did I talk too much?)                                                           ???: Let me guess. In-game computers? Drones? Databases? Chips? The Exit Portals?                   Orion: Erm...                                                                                       ???: Can they modify the terrain? Make you stronger? Become immortal? Change the rules of a world?  Orion: . . . I guess not.                                                                           ???: Have you ever seen a single bug in Eternum? A glitch? Have you ever experienced lag? Or found  the servers down?                                                                                   Orion: Uhh... I guess they have hundreds of people working every day to make sure the experience is absolutely perfect. That's what I meant when I said it's more than a video game.                    ???: . . . Can I ask you a question, friend?                                                        Orion: ...Of course.                                                                                ???: Why are you here? What did you come here looking for?                                          Orion: Where? To this dinner?                                                                       ???: Yes.

I see. In that case... meet me next to the main staircase at midnight. I must show you   something.                                                                                          Orion: (What's going on with this guy?) What is it? Why me?                                         ???: You want answers? Just be there at 12.                                                         Orion: . . . Okay, I will.                                                                          ???: Until then, friend. *Snorts* That is fair. Good luck with your quest, friend.                  Orion: Thanks... (What the hell was that? Just a weirdo, someone trying to mess with me, or... God, I've got a head like a beehive. Too much info and too many strange people in too little time. I need a break. I should join Alex in the gardens, some fresh air will do me good. The gardens of this    place are definitely impressive. They remind me of the Gardens of Versailles. I wonder if they have NPCs taking care of them or if they hire real players... I'm not sure what would be cheaper. Aha!   There she is.) Hey! I finally found you! *Sitting next to her* Phew, that was close! Thank god you  saw your father coming, I don’t think the tattoo removal would have worked on him. He'd have        definitely recognized you! I think he was even starting to remember me, even though we only saw each other for... maybe 20 seconds. And I had a mask on this time, too.                                 Alex: Yeah... he never forgets a face.                                                              Orion: And that's not all, do you know who else was with him? Your brother! I guess he was attending as William's guest.                                                                                Alex: Huh.                                                                                          Orion: But he was way too agitated, so he didn't notice me, luckily. I wonder why he was so         anxious...                                                                                          Alex: Who knows.                                                                                    Orion: . . . Are you okay, Alex? You seem distracted. Are you okay, Alexandra? You seem distracted. Alex: Yeah, sorry, I was just... Remembering something.                                             Orion: Do you wanna talk about it?                                                                  Alex: No, I'm okay. It's nothing. Let's go back to the mansion. Do you see that?                    Orion: The moon?                                                                                    Alex: No, underneath it.                                                                            Orion: Oh, the red star?                                                                            Alex: Yes. I can't believe we can see it... Do you... Do you mind if we stay out here for a bit?    Nah, let’s hang out here                                                                            Orion: Nah, let’s hang out here.                                                                    Let's focus on our goal first                                                                       Orion: Uhh... let’s focus on our goal first. We can come back here after we've talked to all the    guests at the mansion. We can't waste this opportunity.                                             Alex: Yeah... you're right. Let's go.                                                               Orion: The other guests won't go anywhere. The sushi is far too good for that to happen.            Alex: *Chuckles* True.                                                                              Orion: *You lay down next to her* So... what's so special about this red star?                      Alex: That star is RW Cephei. It's a variable star that can only be seen from our hemisphere for 3  days each year. October 15th to October 17th.                                                       Orion: Really? And today it's...                                                                    Alex: ...October 15th. How... How can Eternum be so... real? How can a simulation be so thoroughly  accurate? How... I mean... Someone with a high degree of astronomy knowledge knew about this star,  worked on Eternum, and made sure to implement something that just a handful of people in the world  would notice. And only if they played in a night server during those days! Think about the odds of  that! It's... mind-blowing.                                                                         Orion: Do you believe in magic?                                                                     Alex: *Chuckles* What? I've been in fantasy servers, yeah.                                          Orion: No, not like that. I mean like... in the real world. I met someone after you left, back at   the mansion. He looked strange, and he was saying weird things, but... he mentioned something that  I’ve been kicking around in my head: that Eternum is "more than a video game"... That there's       something more than coding and technology behind it. What if... what if he was right? What if there is something else...?                                                                               Alex: Well, you're not alone in that. There're literally thousands of forum posts online with people posting theories about how Eternum is the Matrix, how Eternum is another dimension, or how the real world is just another server.                                                                      Orion: So you don't believe it?                                                                     Alex: Nah, I don't. I don't believe in magic. But... I would certainly like to believe it. I wish I could believe in magic. It'd just make our world... better. Less boring. Don't you think?           Orion: It certainly would...                                                                        Alex: I guess I'd have to see something for myself that made me believe in it. It's not like there's a switch I can flip, you know? For now, I'll stay with my dumb stars and boring, rational          scientific explanations.                                                                            Orion: Hey, stars are not dumb. It's all a matter of perspective. Maybe you just need a stargazing  partner.                                                                                            Alex: Yeah, you might be right... I used to go stargazing at night with my grandma. She knew all the constellations! Do you see that bright one? That's Ursa Major. Underneath it there's Leo, and...   oh, that W-shaped constellation is Cassiopeia.                                                      Orion: Um... I'm sorry, it all looks the same to me. I can't see anything.                          Alex: *Chuckles* It's normal if you've never done this before. At first I couldn't see anything     either, just a sea of stars with no semblance of order whatsoever. It took me a while... After my   grandma passed away, I thought I'd never go stargazing again, but... I kept on doing it. Kinda to   keep her memory alive, y’know? I remember sneaking outside the house when my parents started arguing and spending hours looking for constellations. I snuck out so many times that I ended up learning  them all.                                                                                           Orion: Did they use to fight a lot?                                                                 Alex: Uh huh. Constantly. I used to feel like fighting was their only interaction.                  Orion: That... must be terrible for a kid. It must have been tough after your grandma died.         Alex: Well, it depends on who you ask. I lived in a big house. I had nannies, butlers, chefs...     everything that money could buy. Many people would say I was living the dream. It just wasn’t... my dream. Growing up, everything I did had to be... regimented. “Alex, don’t put your elbows up on the table, we have international diplomats coming to visit for dinner tonight. Your dad’s promotion     hinges on this.” “No, Alex, you can’t get your ears pierced. That's improper.” “Alex, don’t eat all that food on your plate, that’s not how a woman in higher society should behave...” At a certain    point, I just... snapped. I wasn’t being treated like my own person, I was just a doll... a fucking marionette that my parents wanted to show off and display. I just... couldn't take it anymore.      Orion: No one could blame you. You held on longer than I would have. You made the right choice.     Alex: I... *Snorts* There was one summer... I was supposed to be spending it at some hoity-toity    boarding school abroad. One night, I was gazing at the night sky, just like this. Underneath the    stars, looking for some sign. And I made a decision... The next morning, I told my parents that I   wouldn't go to the school and... that I didn't want to carry on the family business. My mother      started yelling at me, but my father limited himself to just giving me a look of pure contempt. And that’s when “bad girl” Alex was born. The lockpicking, playing hooky, the attitude, all the tats... Oh man, the tats! You should have seen the look on Axel’s face when I got the first one! A mixture  of anger, pity... and honestly, a little envy... I'd pay to see that again!                         Orion: *Chuckles* Oh, you and me both!                                                              Alex: *Lying back* I just didn’t want to be controlled. I didn't want to be told what to do or wear or eat. I wanted to be... myself. ...Does that make any sense?                                      Orion: Absolutely.                                                                                  Alex: These tattoos that I had to hide tonight... I hated doing that. I felt like I was burying part of myself, conforming to what others want me to be. And that’s not who I am. I control my own life, I should be able to do what I want without worrying that I’m hurting someone’s delicate            sensibilities about how I should be acting. I'm... ...my own person. God, I'm sorry, I must sound   like such a prissy brat! I don't know what got into me. Thank you for sticking around for my TED    talk, though. I appreciate that you didn’t fall asleep.                                             Orion: *Chuckles* What are you talking about? I loved having this conversation with you. I like     seeing you opening up with me.                                                                      Alex: Well, don't get used to it. You just caught me in a rare moment of weakness.                  Orion: Yeah, that's my specialty. The crickets, the full moon, the stars... It was all part of my   nefarious plan.                                                                                     Alex: Oh, is that so...? So you just wanted to get close to me because of my family's money, after  all.                                                                                                Orion: Yeah, totally, that was the initial idea. I'm a gold digger! But after getting to know you   better, I discovered a few things that I like much more than that. So now, the Bardot riches no     longer interest me.                                                                                 Alex: Oh, really? Tell me, what things did you discover that you like so much?                      Orion: Ah, nice try. I know you don't like compliments. You won't catch me this time. However, you  can try telling me what things you like about me. I’d love to hear that.                            Alex: About you? I don't like anything.                                                             Orion: Nothing at all? Come on, try giving it some thought.                                         Alex: *Standing up* Hmm... Oh! You... Maybe... Hmm... no, nothing comes to mind, I'm sorry.         Orion: *Chuckles* Let me help you... You could say that I'm a good listener. Or that I'm a pretty   funny guy.                                                                                          Alex: We have different definitions of funny, I think.                                              Orion: Then you could say that you like that I'm sporty as well, just like you. I'm in pretty good  shape, you have to admit.                                                                           Alex: I think skinny and scrawny are better descriptions.                                           Orion: Alright then, you at least have to recognize that I'm a very good Eternum player. I managed  to find not one, but two Gems of Doom in my first month of playing.                                 Alex: Oh, that was pure luck. And we girls did all the legwork! You just happened to be there. You  alone wouldn't even be able to find sand in the desert.                                             Orion: *Chuckles* You're really full of yourself, you know that?                                    Alex: Here, I’ll prove it. There's a small maze right here...                                       Orion: Oh, you just dug your own grave. Get ready to be humiliated, girl. You're about to discover  why they call me Orion "Theseus" Richards, the Labyrinth Master.                                    Alex: *Snorts* Let's see about that... Alright, here's the entrance... First one out the other side wins...                                                                                             Orion: What's the prize for winning?                                                                Alex: Just the honor of victory, of course.                                                         Orion: And nothing else? No extra bonus prize for the winner...?                                    Alex: Hmm... maybe we can arrange something.                                                        Orion: Like what?                                                                                   Alex: *Entering the labyrinth* Get to the other side first and find out...                          Orion: Oh boy... You have no chance, Alex.                                                          Alex: Really? Because I think I see the exit already... Orion? Are you lost?                        Orion: Of course not. I'm about to get out, actually.                                               Alex: Sure...                                                                                       Orion: (Hmm... I think I've walked by this spot before... Maybe I can...)                           Alex: And... it's over, ladies and gentlemen! I've got bad news, Orion. I've reached the other side. Are you still there? I'd wait for you, but I've gotta go back to the mansion. Important mission and all. Don’t feel too bad about coming in second place, I never lose. Anyway, there’s still a lot    of–                                                                                                 Orion: Well, well, well... FINALLY!                                                                 Alex: W-What?! When did you get out?                                                                Orion: I've been waiting for you for 10 minutes now. I was starting to think you’d be lost in there forever.                                                                                            Alex: *Chuckles* Don't bullshit me. We weren’t inside for more than 3 or 4 minutes, and I was       clearly ahead of you.                                                                               Orion: Well... I might have jumped over a hedge or two.                                             Alex: Hah! I knew it. You're a fucking cheater.                                                     Orion: We didn't specify the rules anywhere. Now... where's my prize?                               Alex: Oh, I know what you want, and... you wouldn't be able to handle it, pretty boy.               Orion: I'm pretty sure I would... I know you better than you think. I definitely could handle you. I know that under that tough girl facade of yours, you're as sweet as a cupcake. You can't deceive   me.                                                                                                 Alex: *Chuckles* I'm too much woman for you, Orion.                                                 Orion: I could totally prove you wrong, Alex...                                                     Alex: *Removing her gloves* Oh, could you? And how would you do that, exactly?                      Orion: Give me 20 minutes and I'll show you.                                                        Alex: How about 20 seconds?                                                                         Orion: Oh, are we negotiating now?                                                                  Alex: We're not. That's my...                                                                       Orion: What's that noise? Is someone coming? (Goddammit, nice timing... They're gonna kill the mood, whoever they are.) Hmm?                                                                            William Bardot: *Lights a cigarette* *Exhales*                                                      Orion: Oh man, you have to be kidding me...                                                         Alex: Who is it?                                                                                    Orion: It's... y-your father.                                                                       Alex: My father? What’s he doing?                                                                   Orion: He's smoking. He's... just standing there, menacingly. If looks could kill, I’d be super     worried.                                                                                            Alex: Hmm, yeah, sounds like him.                                                                   Orion: Wait, someone else is coming... Oh shit, it's your brother...                                Alex: It's so nice to see the Bardot family reunited.                                               Axel: Dad, I swear to god, it was him!                                                              William Bardot: Go back to the party, Axel.                                                         Axel: Maybe he's in witness protection! Or maybe...                                                 William Bardot: I told you to drop that line of thinking. I will not repeat myself.                 Axel: B-But you have to listen to me! It makes no sense that–                                       William Bardot: ENOUGH! I'M GETTING SICK OF YOUR IDIOCY! You have to start taking things seriously! I will not have you sullying the Bardot name, like your sister!                                     Axel: I-I'm sorry, Dad...                                                                           William Bardot: Now get back to the fucking mansion and do what you were told! ARE WE CLEAR?        Axel: Y-Yes! I'm s-sorry...                                                                         William Bardot: I’m surrounded by idiots fucking everywhere.                                        Orion: Seems like they had a fight and Axel ran away.                                               Alex: What were they talking about?                                                                 Orion: I'm not sure, I didn't quite catch it. They're too far. O-Okay, I think Axel went back to the mansion, but William is still there. But... f-fuck, I left my mask at the entrance of the maze. We can't let them see us. W-We'll wait here until he goes back to the mansion.                         Alex: *Giggles* You sound a little shaky, Orion. Are you afraid of my daddy?                        Orion: W-What? I'm not!                                                                             Alex: Are you shaking because of Axel, then? Is he the one making you so nervous? You can admit it, don't worry. I won't laugh.                                                                         Orion: Of course not! Not now, not ever...                                                          Alex: Then... Why are you nervous, Orion?                                                           Orion: What are you doing?!                                                                         Alex: Maybe it's... because of me?                                                                  Orion: W-What? No!                                                                                  Alex: No? I don't make you anxious? Not one tiny... little... bit...?                               Orion: Not one bit...                                                                               Alex: And what if I do this? Still nothing...?                                                      Orion: Nothing...                                                                                   Alex: And now...?                                                                                   Orion: (Oh god... This feels so dangerous, yet so exciting...) I've never been calmer...            Alex: I guess I've lost my touch. I'm used to getting people on edge...                             Orion: You'll have to try harder with me...                                                         Alex: Well, I do like challenges... and like I told you, I never lose...                            Orion: We’ll see about that...                                                                      Alex: *Removing your belt* Now tell me.... What if I... (Hmm? Holy shit, his cock is huge as fuck!  This is... certainly not what I was expecting. I was joking about salami the other day, and this    whole time he was packing this...)                                                                  Orion: You okay, Alex? You're so quiet all of a sudden... Are you nervous about something...?       Alex: O-Of course not... It's just that... I-I'm surprised you got hard so fast. That's all.        Couldn’t help yourself, eh? But I guess it's a natural reaction when you're tense...                Orion: You’re not letting up on that, huh? I'm sorry to burst your bubble, but I feel very relaxed  next to you. No nervousness whatsoever.                                                             Alex grabs your penis softly, but firmly.                                                           Alex: This doesn't look relaxed to me.                                                              Orion: O-Oh, god...                                                                                 Alex: I'm sorry? Did you say anything?                                                              Orion: N-Nothing. Y-your hands are just... cold.                                                    Alex: *Chuckles* Yeah, I bet...                                                                     Orion: Oh, f-fuck... O-O-Oh god...                                                                  Alex: Shhhh... Keep your voice down... You wouldn’t want my daddy to hear us, would you...?         Orion: O-Okay, I'll admit it... you're making me a bit nervous now, A-Alex... T-This was fun, b-but we’ve gotta hide... What if your father finishes his cigarette and comes this way...?!              Alex: You’re scared of him seeing us do this? If he saw you, with your pants down, getting your     huge, thick cock rubbed by his little girl... After what you said to him the other day in my house? He'd definitely kill you... Seriously, he would. No joke. He'd send someone to kill you in the real world. Not because he cares about me, but because this is the ultimate way of “sullying the Bardot  name”, you know? The daughter of one of the richest, most powerful men on the planet, is currently  giving you a handjob, less than 20 feet away from her dad.                                          Orion: AAahh... I d-don't want him to kill me...                                                    Alex: *Giggles* Isn't it thrilling? The risk of getting caught? My boobs pressed against your       back... my hands holding onto your manhood, giving you these long... slow... strokes...             Orion: I-It's... a c-confusing mixture of emotions...                                               Alex: Well... I’ll tell you what... if you finish before he puts out his cigarette, I'll let you    hide...                                                                                             Orion: What? I-I can't finish before he does...                                                     Alex: Oh, is that another challenge...?                                                             Orion: Aahh... w-what?                                                                              Alex stops and walks in front of you.                                                               Alex: I see what you're trying to do... This has now become personal.                               Orion: What? I'm not trying to do any– Holy shit... Those perky nipples... I’ve thought about them  ever since we visited Ogygia...                                                                     She kneels down before you and grabs your dick once again.                                          Orion: Oh god...                                                                                    Alex: Do my hands still feel cold?                                                                  Orion: Not anymore...                                                                               Alex: Good...                                                                                       Orion: O-Oh Jesus! F-Fuck... (God, I can't believe Alexandra Bardot is giving me a handjob...)      Ahhh... This is a t-terrible idea, Alex... But... fuck, I love seeing your tits bouncing like       that... You’re driving me insane... I'm not gonna last much longer at this rate...                  Alex: That's the idea.                                                                              Orion: You're enjoying this too, right, you pervert? Your hard nipples give you away...             Alex: I'm enjoying the thrill of the risk. We could be caught at any moment. Check your ego...      Alex starts massaging your balls and increases the speed of her strokes even further.               Orion: G-God...                                                                                     Alex: Do you like this...? Calling ME a pervert, when you’re such a dirty boy, Orion...             Orion: Y-Yeah... Ahhh... This is definitely not how an upper-class lady should behave, Alex...      Alex: Yeah... It definitely isn't... But who gives a fuck? I've never been part of this world       anyway... right? Fuck them all...                                                                   Orion: Y-Yeah, fuck them all... AAahh, yeah...                                                      Alex: Are you gonna cum...?                                                                         Orion: Not yet...                                                                                   Alex: Are you close?                                                                                Orion: I'm not sure...                                                                              Alex: You're gonna make me sweat, aren't you? You’re gonna make me work that load out?              Orion: I know you can try harder...                                                                 Alex: *Chuckles* Fuck you. Very well, then... Let's try a bit harder...                             Orion: Oh fuck yes, that's it...                                                                    Alex: Will my tight, little mouth be enough?                                                        Orion: We'll see... Let me feel it...                                                               She puts your dick inside her mouth and starts caressing your glans with her tongue.                Orion: Oh... F-FUCK!                                                                                Alex: Keep your voice down, you idiot...                                                            Orion: S-Sorry... I... aahhh... I forgot... Oh my f-fucking god... Ahhh... yeah... that's the spot, Alex... Don't stop...                                                                               William Bardot: *Putting out his cigarette*                                                         Orion: Aaahh...!                                                                                    William Bardot: . . . . . .                                                                         . . . . . .                                                                                         William Bardot: . . . *Leaving* This company needs a fucking purge.                                 Alex: Mmmmm....                                                                                     Orion: Oh g-god... Your mouth feels amazing... Do you like the taste of my cock, Alex?              Alex: Mmmffhhh...                                                                                   Orion: I'll take that as a yes...                                                                   Alex: Mmm-hmmmm...                                                                                  Orion: You look so good taking that cock in your mouth... (I’d love to feel how my dick stretches   her lips...)                                                                                        Alex: *Gagging* Mmmmh...                                                                            Orion: (Fuck yes, she's drooling all over me...) Oh yeah... (I wish I could push it further...)     As if she had heard your thoughts, Alex suddenly increases her pace, taking your cock deeper into   her throat.                                                                                         Orion: Ohhh... F-FUCK!!                                                                             Alex: *Gagging* Mmmmm... mmmmhhh... mmmmmfffhhh...                                                  Orion: Oh babe... Oh my god... J-Just like that...!                                                 Alex: *Gagging* MMmmhh...                                                                           Orion: Aaahhh... Your mouth feels so tight...                                                       Alex: Mmmm...                                                                                       Orion: (She's completely obsessed...) I'm gonna cum so much, Alex... You’re doing such a good job, I can feel it coming...                                                                              Cum in her mouth Cum on her face                                                                    Orion: Aaahhh... I'm almost... I'm...                                                               You grab Alex's head and unload your seed deep inside her throat. You push Alex away at the last    second and you unload your seed all over her.                                                       Orion: AAaaaaaarghh... Oh my god... Holy shit, that was a lot...                                    Alex: Hmph. *Standing up* You could have warned me or something, you fucking idiot. *Standing up*   God, what a fucking mess.                                                                           Orion: Y-Yeah, sorry about that.                                                                    Alex: *Wiping her face* You could have warned me or something, you fucking idiot.                   Orion: I did! But you were too engrossed in your task...                                            Alex: That's not true! You didn't say shit! And I w-wasn't engrossed in anything. But anyway, what  matters is that I won! You came before my father finished his cigarette!                            Orion: I... think he left a while ago.                                                              Alex: WHAT?! Goddammit! When did he leave?                                                          Orion: I'm not sure... 5 or 6 minutes ago?                                                          Alex: 5 minutes ago?!                                                                               Orion: See! Totally engrossed! You even lost track of time. It was just too good...                 Alex: It wasn't that great...                                                                       Orion: Well, it was for me.                                                                         Alex: *Snorts* Yeah, I can imagine.                                                                 Orion: Can't wait to tell everyone what I did with one of the Bardots.                              Alex: Whoa, whoa! Hold your horses! Y-You tell anything to anyone and you're a dead man! You hear   me? DEAD!                                                                                           Orion: It was a joke!                                                                               Alex: I don't care if it was a joke or not, you're not telling shit to anyone! Not Dalia, not Chang, NO ONE!                                                                                            Orion: (Huh, this reminds me a lot of the situation with Dalia at the Cove. She reacted the same    way. The pair of them are actually quite similar... Can you imagine if I ever got both of them to–) Alex: ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?!                                                                     Orion: N-No one! I swear! Don't worry, you can trust me! N-No one will ever know. I don't even      remember what happened. What are we talking about? Did something happen?                            Alex: . . . ...Good. This didn't happen.                                                            Orion: It never happened.                                                                           Alex: Okay... now that that's clear... I guess we should go back to the party. And by the way, I    forgot to hand this to you earlier since you were late. This is a communicator I got from Nova. It  can be easily hidden and it works in all servers where technology is allowed. Call me if you need me or in case of an emergency.                                                                        Orion: Oh, that's neat! I’ve gotta thank Nova later. But wait, you're not coming back inside with   me?                                                                                                 Alex: No, you go ahead. I'll go to the fountain I saw back there to... *clears throat* ...clean     myself a little.                                                                                    Orion: Oh... yeah, sorry about the mess... That makes sense, though. I'll wait for you in the main  hall.                                                                                               Alex: Alright.                                                                                      Orion: Thank you for this, Alex, you made this a very special night...                              Alex: . . . It certainly was... ...special.                                                         Orion: (Damn, boy! That was something else. And not only the blowjob... I loved seeing Alex open up with me when we were stargazing. This dinner turned out better than I could have ever imagined. I   came looking for copper and found gold! Maybe this could be the beginning of something more with    Alex...? Could it be possible? I think I saw her smirking when she turned the corner... Maybe the   ice queen’s heart is finally melting? Hmmm... Anyway, I'll worry about that later. I should pick up my mask from the maze entrance and head back inside now.)                                           Alex: *Standing up* Oh by the way, I forgot to hand this to you earlier since you were late. Take   this communicator I got from Nova. It can be easily hidden and it works in all servers where        technology is allowed. Call me if you need me or in case of an emergency.                           Orion: Oh, that's neat! I’ve gotta thank Nova later. But wait, you're not coming back inside with   me?                                                                                                 Alex: No, you go ahead. I saw Ms. Dilinger going to the fountain near the entrance. She's Ulysses'  PR manager, I think I can get some info from her.                                                   Orion: Oh, clever. Alright, I'll see you inside. I'll be waiting for you in the main hall. Good     luck! (I wonder what she was thinking about... Maybe I can try to ask her about it after we're done here, although... I doubt she'd share it with me. Anyway, let's get back inside for now. Alright,   back to business. Now that I think about it, I haven't seen any other Gem holders. I wasn't         expecting Thanatos to show up, but there has to be at least another one... Maybe I should take      another look around.)                                                                               Dr. Du Pont: William asked me to sell him my part of the company again. I don't know what to do,    honestly. I think Mos already agreed. Hmm? Oh... the IT guy.                                        Orion: Uh? Oh, y-yeah! That's me!                                                                   Dr. Du Pont: Hmm? Who are you?                                                                      Orion: Uhh... I'm Raimond. I'm... in charge of Ulysses' network security.                           Dr. Du Pont: ...I see. We're going to the Golden Room. Are you coming?                              Orion: Well... it's 11:00 PM. The Founder must be about to arrive, right? I thought he'd give a     speech or something.                                                                                Dr. Du Pont: *Laughs* What? Is this your first Ulysses dinner?                                      Orion: Um... yeah, it is, actually. Why?                                                            Dr. Du Pont: The Founder is not coming. He never does.                                              Orion: What...?                                                                                     Ms. Astor: Yeah, one of the NPCs just told me that he had an emergency and he had to cancel his     appearance at the last moment. Hah! What a surprise!                                                Orion: He does this a lot?                                                                          Ms. Astor: Yeah, all the time. It's... quite funny, actually. I don't know why he doesn't just say  he's not coming from the beginning.                                                                 Orion: Maybe he's not a very social person.                                                         Ms. Astor: Maybe. I'll ask him myself if I ever see him.                                            Orion: Wait... what? You've never seen the Founder in-person?                                       Ms. Astor: Not even once. Neither I nor anyone from Ulysses' board of directors. It's always memos, emails, or pre-recorded videos, like the ones shown when a Gem of Doom is found. Huh! Maybe William knows him in-person, who knows. Perhaps we're not special enough...                                 Orion: (But then, how...)                                                                           Dr. Du Pont: Anyway, are you coming with us, or not?                                                Orion: Erm... g-go ahead, I'll stay here for a bit.                                                 Dr. Du Pont: Step aside, then.                                                                      Orion: (None of Ulysses' senior officials have ever seen the Founder? How is that possible...?      That’s inconceivable... Unless... I’ve gotta find Alex. I'll call her with this communicator she    gave me. But I should find a quiet place. I don't want William Bardot to find me while I'm          distracted here. Wow, this mansion is huge. Once you leave the main hall, it becomes a labyrinth of corridors and rooms. This cellar is very far from the main entrance, so it should be safe to remove my mask.) *Sitting on the stairs* Okay... how does this thing work? Um... hello? Alex? Do I have to keep pressing this button or...?                                                                    Alex: No, you only have to press it once. What do you want now, dumb-dumb? You can't live without   me? Are you missing me already?                                                                     Orion: *Chuckles* Oh yeah, being apart from you for more than 5 minutes is torture.                 Alex: Don't worry, I'm going back to the mansion now. I managed to clean the... dress. More or less. Are you lost or something?                                                                         Orion: *Chuckles* Yeah, it's dark and I'm scared. I need help.                                      Alex: Don't worry, I'm going back to the mansion to rescue you. Where are you?                      Orion: Go to the end of the east wing of the mansion, on the ground floor. I'm in some kind of      cellar, a basement, maybe. There's something I wanted to discuss with you in private.               Alex: Discuss something in private? That sounds ominous. Any hints about the topic?                 Orion: Well, it's about how we should handle our "investigation" for the rest of the night. You     know, our questions and the people we talk to. I have... a suspicion.                               Alex: A suspicion?                                                                                  Orion: Yes, about this... "Founder". Did you know that no one from Ulysses' high-ranking positions  has ever seen him?                                                                                  Alex: Really? Never? How is that possi– Wait a second... Now that you mention it... I remember      hearing my father bitching about how he never showed up to any events or meetings, and how that made him a weak leader.                                                                                 Orion: Exactly! No one has ever seen him in person. No one knows his real name. No one has ever had a real conversation with him face-to-face, either in Eternum or in the real world. He can only be   seen in those pre-recorded holograms when there's a public announcement. All that makes me believe  that...                                                                                             Alex: T-The Founder doesn't exist...                                                                Orion: *Standing up* Bingo! He's not real! The Founder is just a fucking cover! And whoever is truly pulling the strings just needed a scapegoat. A mask to hide behind! There's no Founder, there's no genius, and there's no messiah!                                                                     Alex: B-But... He's the most important man in the world. If he doesn't exist... Who created Eternum and most of its servers? Who's in charge of Ulysses right now?                                      Orion: That's what we have to find out! All I know is that...                                       Alex: . . . What did you say? It got cut off.                                                       . . .                                                                                               Alex: Orion? Hellooooo...?                                                                          . . .                                                                                               Alex: (Bah, batteries must have run out. I should go find him. He said... east wing? Real           specific... It’s gonna take me ages to find him around here...)                                     Orion: Um... I-Is anything w-wrong...? If t-this is a restricted section of the house, I'm s-sorry, I d-didn't know–                                                                                    ???: I must admit that I am impressed. Just a little over a month into playing Eternum... And yet... You managed to find not one, but two Gems of Doom. You killed two of my Praetorians... You found   the player who has Dione in her possession... And you claimed the third Weapon of Atlas as yours... Calypso.                                                                                            Orion: . . .                                                                                        ???: I am sorry, where are my manners... Please, sit down. I have been looking forward to meeting   you... ...Orion.
